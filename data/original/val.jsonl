Methods The sample comprised 2506 Portuguese healthy children and adolescents aged 10\u201318\u2005years, from a cross-sectional school-based study (2008). PA and sedentary behaviour were assessed with accelerometry.

Our results indicate that individual fitness benefits resulted from associations of philopatric female kin, and support the hypothesis that increased tolerance of proximity of kin is a proximate mechanism for these benefits.

Recent studies have shown that gut leakiness that occurs in a subset of alcoholics is the primary cause of endotoxemia in ASH. The reasons for this differential susceptibility are not known. Since disruption of circadian rhythms occurs in some alcoholics and circadian genes control the expression of several genes that are involved in regulation of intestinal permeability, we hypothesized that alcohol induces intestinal hyperpermeability by stimulating expression of circadian clock gene proteins in the intestinal epithelial cells.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used Caco-2 monolayers grown on culture inserts as an in vitro model of intestinal permeability and performed Western blotting, permeability, and siRNA inhibition studies to examine the role of Clock and Per2 circadian genes in alcohol-induced hyperpermeability. We also measured PER2 protein levels in intestinal mucosa of alcohol-fed rats with intestinal hyperpermeability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlcohol, as low as 0.2%, induced time dependent increases in both Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability and in CLOCK and PER2 proteins. SiRNA specific inhibition of either Clock or Per2 significantly inhibited alcohol-induced monolayer hyperpermeability. Alcohol-fed rats with increased total gut permeability, assessed by urinary sucralose, also had significantly higher levels of PER2 protein in their duodenum and proximal colon than control rats.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur studies: (i) demonstrate a novel mechanism for alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability through stimulation of intestinal circadian clock gene expression, and (ii) provide direct evidence for a central role of circadian genes in regulation of intestinal permeability.", "citedAbstract": "This review summarizes new findings on the bidirectional interactions between alcohol and the clock genes, underlying the generation of circadian rhythmicity. At the behavioral level, both adult and perinatal ethanol treatments after the free-running period and light response of the circadian clock in rodents; genetic ethanol preference in alcohol-preferring rat lines is also associated with alterations in circadian pacemaker function. At the neuronal level, it has been shown that ethanol consumption alters the circadian expression patterns of period (per) genes in various brain regions, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Notably, circadian functions of beta-endorphin-containing neurons that participate in the control of alcohol reinforcement become disturbed after chronic alcohol intake. In turn, per2 gene activity regulates alcohol intake through its effects on the glutamatergic system through glutamate reuptake mechanisms and thereby may affect a variety of physiological processes that are governed by our internal clock. In summary, a new pathologic chain has been identified that contributes to the negative health consequences of chronic alcohol intake. Thus, chronic alcohol intake alters the expression of per genes, and as a consequence, a variety of neurochemical and neuroendocrine functions become disturbed. Further steps in this pathologic chain are alterations in physiological and immune functions that are under circadian control, and, as a final consequence, addictive behavior might be triggered or sustained by this cascade.", "citingTitle": "Role of intestinal circadian genes in alcohol-induced gut leakiness.", "citedTitle": "Alcohol consumption and the body's biological clock."}

Bacteria often acquire resistance from a mutation of chromosomal genes during therapy. We have recently shown that the evolution of resistance to ciprofloxacin in vivo and in vitro requires the induction of a mutation that is mediated by the cleavage of the SOS repressor LexA and the associated derepression of three specialized DNA polymerases (polymerase II [Pol II], Pol IV, and Pol V). These results led us to suggest that it may be possible to design drugs to inhibit these proteins and that such drugs might be coadministered with antibiotics to prevent mutation and the evolution of resistance. For the approach to be feasible, there must not be any mechanisms through which bacteria can induce mutations and acquire antibiotic resistance that are independent of LexA and its repressed polymerases. Perhaps the most commonly cited mechanism to elevate bacterial mutation rates is the inactivation of methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR). However, it is unclear whether this represents a LexA-independent mechanism or if the mutations that arise in MMR-deficient hypermutator strains are also dependent on LexA cleavage and polymerase derepression. In this work, we show that LexA cleavage and polymerase derepression are required for the evolution of clinically significant resistance in MMR-defective Escherichia coli. Thus, drugs that inhibit the proteins responsible for induced mutations are expected to efficiently prevent the evolution of resistance, even in MMR-deficient hypermutator strains.", "citedAbstract": "The incidence of emergent resistance and clinical factors affecting its development were evaluated by retrospective review of 173 studies encompassing over 14,000 patients.

The rtER mRNA encoded a 65-kDa protein which was immunorevealed by a specific antibody and migrated with the authentic rtER major protein form detected in trout liver. Yeast rtER bound estradiol with high affinity and the dissociation constant (Kd = 1.35 nM) was very similar to the value measured from trout liver extracts but 3-5-fold higher than the Kd found for human estrogen receptor (hER). This indicates therefore that the rtER has a lower estradiol affinity compared to the human receptor. While the hER Kd remained unchanged at both 4 degrees C or 22 degrees C, it was slightly modified at 30 degrees C. The Kd measured for rtER at 22 degrees C and 30 degrees C were about 2-fold, and 12-fold higher, respectively, than the Kd obtained at 4 degrees C suggesting an alteration of the rtER affinity for its ligand at elevated temperature. To examine the estrogen-receptor-mediated activation of transcription in yeast, reporter plasmids integrated or not in the yeast genome were used. The reporter genes consist of one, two, or three copies of estrogen-responsive elements (ERE) upstream of the yeast proximal CYC1 or URA3 promoters fused to the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli coding for beta-galactosidase. The induction of beta-galactosidase activity for all reporter genes was strictly dependent on the presence of rtER and estrogens. The activation of transcription mediated by rtER responded in an estradiol-dose-dependent manner as in animal cells. However, compared to hER, the estradiol concentration necessary to achieve maximal activation was 10-fold higher. This is probably a consequence of the lower estradiol-affinity for rtER compared to hER. The levels of induction of the reporter genes containing two or three ERE were strongly enhanced compared to the one ERE construct. This is in agreement with the synergistic effect previously described for multiple ERE. The magnitudes of transcriptional induction mediated by rtER and hER were similar when the reporter gene containing three ERE was used but changed when the one ERE construct was used. In this case transcriptional activation indicated by rtER was 10-20 fold lower. This suggests that rtER requires protein/protein interaction for its stabilization on DNA. Antiestrogens were able to bind rtER and promote gene transcription. However, to produce effects comparable to those obtained with estrogens, much higher concentrations were required.

Thus, we hypothesized that genetic variants within LPIN1 are associated with traits of the metabolic syndrome. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\u2014 A total of 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the LPIN1 gene region were genotyped in an age- and sex-stratified sample of the general population (Monitoring Trends and Determinants on Cardiovascular Diseases Study Augsburg; DNA and phenotypes of 1,416 Caucasians). Ten SNPs were also genotyped for replication in an independent sample of 1,030 subjects recruited throughout Germany. The metabolic syndrome was defined via the sum of its core components and, additionally, by a factor score derived from factor analysis. Permutation-based methods were used to test the association between genetic LPIN1 variants and metabolic traits for empirical significance. RESULTS\u2014 Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed three LD blocks encompassing LPIN1. We identified three associated three-marker haplotypes: one common haplotype (26.8% frequency) increases the risk for the metabolic syndrome (odds ratio 1.6 [95% CI 1.2\u20132.2]), while the other two, being less common (5.7 and 4.0%), are strongly associated with lower blood pressure levels (systolic blood pressure 127 \u00b1 18 vs. 135 \u00b1 20 mmHg; P = 0.0001), a lower BMI (24.6 \u00b1 3.6 vs. 26.9 \u00b1 4.1 kg/m2; P = 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22127) and waist circumference (82 \u00b1 12 vs. 90 \u00b1 12 cm; P = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22128), lower A1C levels (5.1 \u00b1 0.7 vs. 5.3 \u00b1 0.9%; P = 0.0002), as well as a lower metabolic syndrome factor score (\u22120.67 \u00b1 1.00 vs. 0.04 \u00b1 1.24; P = 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22127).

To promote commensalism in animals and disease in humans, Campylobacter jejuni produces a flagellar organelle for motility. In addition to tight transcriptional regulation of flagellar genes, C.\u2003jejuni also controls flagellar biosynthesis by phase variation. In this study, an unusual phase\u2010variable mechanism controlling production of FlgR, the response regulator of the FlgSR two\u2010component system required for transcription of \u03c354\u2010dependent flagellar genes, is identified. Phase variation of FlgR production is due to loss or gain of a nucleotide in homopolymeric adenine or thymine tracts within flgR. This mechanism occurs during commensalism in poultry to alter the colonization capacity of C.\u2003jejuni, presumably by influencing the motility phenotype of the bacterium. These findings provide more understanding into the genetic and colonization strategies C.\u2003jejuni employs to achieve commensalism in a natural host. Second, due to the richness of the C.\u2003jejuni genome in adenine or thymine residues and the apparent lack of the normal set of mismatch repair enzymes, the results from this study may suggest that the C.\u2003jejuni genome is more unstable and variable than previously realized. Furthermore, phase variation of flagellar motility by targeting flgR may be a phenomenon specific to C.\u2003jejuni that is absent in other Campylobacter species and contribute to reasons why C.\u2003jejuni is more frequently found as a commensal organism in poultry and as the cause of disease in humans.", "citedAbstract": "Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans in developed countries throughout the world.

Although the final positions of the two eyes were symmetrical, large dynamic asymmetries often occurred.

Although familial AD appears to be caused by A\u03b2 overproduction, sporadic AD (the most prevalent form) may result from impairment in clearance. Recent evidence suggests that several proteases may contribute to the degradation of A\u03b2. Furthermore, astrocytes have recently been implicated as a potential cellular mediator of A\u03b2 degradation. In this study, we examined the possibility that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), proteases known to be expressed and secreted by astrocytes, could play a role in extracellular A\u03b2 degradation. We found that astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques showed enhanced expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in aged amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 mice. Moreover, astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) degraded A\u03b2, lowering levels and producing several fragments after incubation with synthetic human A\u03b21\u201340 and A\u03b21\u201342.

However, little is known about variations in soil C, N and P nutrient fraction stratification following artificial vegetation in Loess Plateau China. Based on the hypothesis that re-vegetated can improve soil quality and stratification ratios (SR) can be used as an indicator to evaluate soil quality. This study measured contents and storages of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and their SRs in topsoil (0\u201320 cm) and subsoil (20\u201360 cm) in three 30-year re-vegetated lands that had been converted from arable land (Robinia pseudoacacia L., Caragana Korshinskii Kom. and abandoned cropland with low interferences and few management measures) and one slope cropland (SC) as a control for three soil profiles(0\u201320 cm, 20\u201340 cm and 40\u201360 cm) from June 2009 to June 2013. The results showed that the contents and storages of SOC, TN and TP in re-vegetated land were significantly higher than those in the SC in both topsoil and subsoil. The storages of SOC, TN and TP in the topsoil (0\u201320 cm) of the re-vegetated lands increased by 16.2%-26.4%, 12.7%-28.4% and 16.5%-20.9%, respectively, and increased by smaller but significant amounts in subsoil from 2009 to 2013. The SRs for SOC, TN and TP in the re-vegetated lands were mostly >2 (either for 0\u201320:20\u201340 cm or 0\u201320:40\u201360 cm) and greater than that in the SC. The SRs showed an increasing trend with increasing restoration age. The results also showed that the land use type and soil depth were the most influential factors for the SRs and storages, and the SRs of SOC and TN had significantly positive correlations with their storages.

Our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (SOC) and how vegetation change may affect SOC distributions with depth. The goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of SOC content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths; (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution of SOC; and (3) to estimate global SOC storage to 3 m, including an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil carbon storage. We based our analysis on .2700 soil profiles in three global databases supplemented with data for climate, vegetation, and land use. The analysis focused on mineral soil layers. Plant functional types significantly affected the vertical distribution of SOC. The per- centage of SOC in the top 20 cm (relative to the first meter) averaged 33%, 42%, and 50% for shrublands, grasslands, and forests, respectively. In shrublands, the amount of SOC in the second and third meters was 77% of that in the first meter; in forests and grasslands, the totals were 56% and 43%, respectively. Globally, the relative distribution of SOC with depth had a slightly stronger association with vegetation than with climate, but the opposite was true for the absolute amount of SOC. Total SOC content increased with precipitation and clay content and decreased with temperature. The importance of these controls switched with depth, climate dominating in shallow layers and clay content dominating in deeper layers, possibly due to increasing percentages of slowly cycling SOC fractions at depth. To control for the effects of climate on vegetation, we grouped soils within climatic ranges and compared distributions for vegetation types within each range. The percentage of SOC in the top 20 cm relative to the first meter varied from 29% in cold arid shrublands to 57% in cold humid forests and, for a given climate, was always deepest in shrublands, inter- mediate in grasslands, and shallowest in forests ( P , 0.05 in all cases). The effect of vegetation type was more important than the direct effect of precipitation in this analysis. These data suggest that shoot/root allocations combined with vertical root distributions, affect the distribution of SOC with depth. Global SOC storage in the to p3mo fsoil was 2344 Pg C, or 56% more than the 1502 Pg estimated for the first meter (which is similar to the total SOC estimates of 1500-1600 Pg made by other researchers). Global totals for the second and third meters were 491 and 351 Pg C, and the biomes with the most SOC at 1-3 m depth were tropical evergreen forests (158 Pg C) and tropical grasslands/savannas (146 Pg C). Our work suggests that plant functional types, through differences in allocation, help to control SOC distributions with depth in the soil. Our analysis also highlights the potential importance of vegetation change and SOC pools for carbon sequestration strategies.", "citingTitle": "Soil C, N, P and Its Stratification Ratio Affected by Artificial Vegetation in Subsoil, Loess Plateau China", "citedTitle": "THE VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SOIL ORGANIC CARBON AND ITS RELATION TO CLIMATE AND VEGETATION"}

The paper presents the results of an experimental study where one group of students was taught using role-playing and the control group was taught using traditional approach. Results indicate that students taught using role-playing demonstrated a better understanding about the subject matter and showed more positive attitude towards construction as a profession.

TNF-alpha has been linked to the regulation of HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1 protein), a nuclear protein that upon macrophage stimulation can be secreted and act as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. This study investigated the influence of a degradable polar hydrophobic ionic polyurethane (D-PHI) on MDM cell expression of pro- versus anti-inflammatory markers, when the material was uncoated or pre-coated with collagen prior to cell studies. Effects were compared to similar groups on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS).

This impediment originates from the water molecule's finite size, which entails a net energetic cost for water exclusion when the formation of compensating close intraprotein contacts is not yet complete. Based on recent advances, we extend our exploration of these microscopic elementary desolvation barriers' roles in the emergence of generic properties of protein folding. Using continuum G\u014d-like C(alpha) chain models of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) and barnase as examples, we underscore that elementary desolvation barriers between a protein's constituent groups can significantly reduce native conformational fluctuations relative to model predictions that neglected these barriers. An increasing height of elementary desolvation barriers leads to thermodynamically more cooperative folding/unfolding transitions (i.e., higher overall empirical folding barriers) and higher degrees of kinetic cooperativity as manifested by more linear rate-stability relationships under constant temperature. Applying a spatially non-uniform thermodynamic parametrization we recently introduced for the pairwise C(alpha) potentials of mean force, the present barnase model further illustrates that desolvation is a probable physical underpinning for the experimentally observed high intrinsic enthalpic folding barrier under isostability conditions.", "citedAbstract": "Experimental data from global analyses of temperature (T) and denaturant dependence of the folding rates of small proteins led to an intrinsic enthalpic folding barrier hypothesis: to a good approximation, the T-dependence of folding rate under constant native stability conditions is Arrhenius. Furthermore, for a given protein, the slope of isostability folding rate versus 1/T is essentially independent of native stability. This hypothesis implies a simple relationship between chevron and Eyring plots of folding that is easily discernible when both sets of rates are expressed as functions of native stability. Using experimental data in the literature, we verify the predicted chevron-Eyring relationship for 14 proteins and determine their intrinsic enthalpic folding barriers, which vary approximately from 15 kcal/mol to 40 kcal/mol for different proteins. These enthalpic barriers do not appear to correlate with folding rates, but they exhibit correlation with equilibrium unfolding enthalpy at room temperature. Intrinsic enthalpic barriers with similarly high magnitudes apply as well to at least two cases of peptide-peptide and peptide-protein association, suggesting that these barriers are a hallmark of certain general and fundamental kinetic processes during folding and binding. Using a class of explicit-chain C(alpha) protein models with constant elementary enthalpic desolvation barriers between C(alpha) positions, we show that small microscopic pairwise desolvation barriers, which are a direct consequence of the particulate nature of water, can act cooperatively to give rise to a significant overall enthalpic barrier to folding. This theoretical finding provides a physical rationalization for the high intrinsic enthalpic barriers in protein folding energetics.

Our study included repeat measurements, taken five months apart, on 16 elderly volunteers that demonstrate intra-subject reproducibility of the absolute measurements with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.9 for absorption coefficient (\u03bca), oxy-hemoglobin concentration ([HbO2]), and total hemoglobin concentration ([HbT]), 0.7 for deoxy-hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), 0.8 for hemoglobin oxygen saturation (StO2), and 0.7 for reduced scattering coefficient (\u03bc's). We found significant differences between the two age groups.

Like glucose transport, protein kinase C (PKC)-a and -b are also constitutively activated and are not further stimulatable by insulin in L6 skeletal muscle cells overexpressing PED (L6PED). PKC-z features no basal change but completely loses insulin sensitivity in L6PED. In these cells, blockage of PKC-a and -b additively returns 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) uptake to the levels of cells expressing only endogenous PED (L6WT). Blockage of PKC-a and -b also restores insulin activation of PKC-z in L6PED cells, with that of PKC-a sixfold more effective than PKC-b. Similar effects on 2-DG uptake and PKC-z were also achieved by 50-fold overexpression of PKC-z in L6PED. In L6WT, fivefold overexpression of PKC-a or -b increases basal 2-DG uptake and impairs further insulin induction with no effect on insulin receptor or insulin receptor substrate phosphorylation. In these cells, overexpression of PKC-a blocks insulin induction of PKC-z activity. PKC-b is 10-fold less effective than PKC-a in inhibiting PKC-z stimulation. Expression of the dominant-negative K3W PKC-z mutant simultaneously inhibits insulin activation of PKC-z and 2-DG uptake in the L6WT cells.

Earlier studies have suggested that more highly expressed loci in Drosophila melanogaster are more biased, consistent with findings from several prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes that codon bias is partly due to natural selection for translational efficiency. We link this model of varying selection intensity to the population-genetics prediction that the effectiveness of natural selection is decreased under reduced recombination. In analyses of 385 D. melanogaster loci, we find that codon bias is reduced in regions of low recombination (i.e., near centromeres and telomeres and on the fourth chromosome). The effect does not appear to be a linear function of recombination rate; rather, it seems limited to regions with the very lowest levels of recombination. The large majority of the genome apparently experiences recombination at a sufficiently high rate for effective natural selection against suboptimal codons. These findings support models of the Hill-Robertson effect and genetic hitchhiking and are largely consistent with multiple reports of low levels of DNA sequence variation in regions of low recombination.", "citingTitle": "Protein Polymorphism Is Negatively Correlated with Conservation of Intronic Sequences and Complexity of Expression Patterns in Drosophila melanogaster", "citedTitle": "Reduced natural selection associated with low recombination in Drosophila melanogaster."}

On average, the overall effect of elevated CO2 (+CO2 and +CO2+O3 versus ambient and +O3) was to increase leaf mass by 36% whereas the overall effect of elevated O3 was to decrease leaf mass by 13%, with similar effects on stand leaf area. However, there were important CO2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0O3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0year interactions wherein some treatment effects on leaf mass changed dramatically relative to ambient from 2002 to 2008.

I suggest separating three test conditions: uncoupled systems (plants not depending in a natural nutrient cycle) (I); expanding systems, in which plants are given ample space and time to explore otherwise limited resources (II); and fully coupled systems in which the natural nutrient cycling governs growth at steady-state leaf area index (LAI) and fine root renewal (III). Data for 10 type III experiments yield rather moderate effects of elevated CO2 on plant biomass production, if any.

What is the role of 18F-FDG PET in the evaluation of patients with a pulmonary nodule or lung cancer? Dr. Kalra. In the evaluation of patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule, 18F-FDG PET improves characterization of the nodule by estimating the probability of malignancy. The high positive predictive value for malignancy in nodules greater than 1 cm in diameter suggests that those with positive scan results should undergo either percutaneous biopsy or surgical resection. Histologic examination of PET-positive lesions is necessary because false-positive PET findings can be encountered with granulomatous lesions secondary to sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or infection [1].

The hypothesis that aerosols can increase the lifetime of the MCSs by weakening or delaying precipitation has long been proposed, but we have not known whether that increase is significant on global and regional scales, and, if so, how it compares with the influence of meteorological conditions. We use multiyear collocated geostationary and polar-orbital satellite datasets to provide, to our knowledge, the first observational assessment of such an aerosol effect and its relative importance compared with other meteorological conditions in determining the variability of MCSs\u2019 lifetime. Using collocated measurements from geostationary and polar-orbital satellites over tropical continents, we provide a large-scale statistical assessment of the relative influence of aerosols and meteorological conditions on the lifetime of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Our results show that MCSs\u2019 lifetime increases by 3\u201324 h when vertical wind shear (VWS) and convective available potential energy (CAPE) are moderate to high and ambient aerosol optical depth (AOD) increases by 1 SD (1\u03c3). However, this influence is not as strong as that of CAPE, relative humidity, and VWS, which increase MCSs\u2019 lifetime by 3\u201330 h, 3\u201327 h, and 3\u201330 h per 1\u03c3 of these variables and explain up to 36%, 45%, and 34%, respectively, of the variance of the MCSs\u2019 lifetime. AOD explains up to 24% of the total variance of MCSs\u2019 lifetime during the decay phase. This result is physically consistent with that of the variation of the MCSs\u2019 ice water content (IWC) with aerosols, which accounts for 35% and 27% of the total variance of the IWC in convective cores and anvil, respectively, during the decay phase. The effect of aerosols on MCSs\u2019 lifetime varies between different continents. AOD appears to explain up to 20\u201322% of the total variance of MCSs\u2019 lifetime over equatorial South America compared with 8% over equatorial Africa.

Our analysis is based on satellite data collected over equatorial Africa, South Asia, and the Amazon basin between June 2006 and June 2008. We identify substantial variations in the relationships between convective properties and aerosol transport by region and stage of convective development. The most extensive UT ALs over equatorial Africa are associated with mature MCSs, while the most extensive UT ALs over South Asia and the Amazon are associated with growing MCSs. Convective aerosol transport over the Amazon is weaker than that observed over the other two regions despite similar transport frequencies, likely due to the smaller sizes and shorter mean lifetimes of MCSs over the Amazon. Variations in UT ALs in the vicinity of tropical MCSs are primarily explained by variations in the horizontal sizes of the associated MCSs and are largely unrelated to aerosol loading in the lower troposphere. We also identify potentially important relationships with the number of convective cores, vertical wind shear, and convective fraction during the growing and mature stages of MCS development.

The objectives were: (i) to study patterns of species richness along the abandonment gradient in semi-arid conditions (e.g., to test the \u201chumped-back model\u201d in our system); (ii) to test whether different broad life forms (annuals, forbs, grasses and woody species) showed different patterns along the abandonment gradient, and (iii) to examine to what extent plants with different dispersal strategies dominate at different stages of succession. The explained variance of the regression relating species richness to years since abandonment is improved when considering different life forms. The results suggest that cover and richness of different functional groups show a non-linear unimodal (often positive-skewed) pattern along the gradient (age since abandonment). Maximum total richness is found at young stages of abandonment (<20 years), when most life forms and dispersal strategies coexist. Annuals and perennial forbs reached their maximum richness during the first 10 years of abandonment. About 45% of total woody species richness is reached at this time as a consequence of early colonization of zoochorous shrubs. While the results showed a tendency towards a life-form replacement sequence, the pattern is not so clear when looking at the different dispersal strategies. The results complement previous results in Mediterranean conditions and emphasise the importance of considering different functional types when studying successional patterns.", "citedAbstract": "Plant species diversity patterns of the Rocky Mountain forests were found to be at variance with patterns reported from other regions. The most centrally located forests in terms of elevation, site moisture and successional status were found to have the lowest diversity. In contrast, the peripheral and environmentally more severe sites were found to have relatively high diversity. In particular, the forest-grassland transition and the low elevation riparian forests have species diversity values as high as any yet reported from western North America. When diversity was examined in terms of variation across elevation or moisture gradients, varying results were obtained due to the interaction of these factors. The failure of previous studies to converge on generalizations about plant diversity reflects, in part, the failure of most investigators to view diversity in a regional context of variation across several interacting gradients. Diversity was seen to vary inversely with the degree of development of the forest canopy. The interaction of different components of the forest community is one reason for the failure of general patterns of plant species diversity to emerge from previous studies. A potentially rich herb community can be greatly suppressed by a single species tree stratum. Among the most successful work to date on species diversity is that on birds, a distinct albeit large and functional group. It is unlikely that similar success could have been achieved through work on all animal species simultaneously. This suggests the need to examine plant species diversity, not in terms of total diversity, but in terms of component functional groups, perhaps guilds, growing under similar microclimatic conditions and subject to similar competitive pressures.", "citingTitle": "Species richness and cover along a 60-year chronosequence in old-fields of southeastern Spain", "citedTitle": "Forest vegetation of the Colorado Front Range: Patterns of species diversity"}

In situ hybridization analyses revealed that the SPP2 dioxygenase (Solanum pollinated pistil) from the self-incompatible wild potato Solanum chacoense Bitt. is also developmentally regulated, with mRNA levels gradually regressing from the tip of the style towards the ovary during pistil development. At maturity, the upper limit of SPP2 transcript distribution coincided with the abscission zone of the style and SPP2 dioxygenase expression in ovaries coincided with the fertilization receptivity period of the flower. Pollination, as well as wounding of the style, induced an increase in SPP2 mRNA steady-state levels at a distance, in the ovary. Treatments with stress hormones including methyl jasmonate, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid mimicked the wound response and also induced SPP2 transcripts in the ovary.

In the present study on penalty kicking in soccer, our aim was to apply a Markov chain modelling method to eye movement data obtained from goalkeepers. Building on the discrete analysis of gaze employed by Dicks et al. (Atten Percept Psychophys 72(3):706\u2013720, 2010b), we wanted to statistically model the relative probabilities of the goalkeeper\u2019s gaze being directed to different locations throughout the penalty taker\u2019s approach (Dicks et al. in Atten Percept Psychophys 72(3):706\u2013720, 2010b). Examination of gaze behaviours under in situ and video-simulation task constraints reveals differences in information pickup for perception and action (Attention, Perception and Psychophysics 72(3), 706\u2013720). The probabilities of fixating anatomical locations of the penalty taker were high under simulated movement response conditions. In contrast, when actually required to intercept kicks, the goalkeepers initially favoured watching the penalty taker\u2019s head but then rapidly shifted focus directly to the ball for approximately the final second prior to foot-ball contact.

The neurobiological basis of anxiety and depression, however, remains poorly understood. Further, there is a clear need for the development of better treatments for these disorders. Emerging data with genetic and pharmacological tools supports a role for GABAB receptors in both anxiety and depression. GABAB receptors are metabotropic GABA receptors that are comprised of two subunits, GABAB1 and GABAB2, which form heterodimers. The GABAB(1) gene is transcribed into two predominate isoforms, GABAB(1a) and GABAB(1b) which differ in sequence primarily by the inclusion of a pair of sushi domains (or short consensus repeats) in the GABAB(1a) N-terminus. Both isoforms heterodimerize with GABAB2 subunits to form functional receptors. The two GABAB(1) isoforms and the GABAB(2) subunit constitute the majority of the molecular diversity of the GABAB receptor. However, in the absence of any isoform-selective ligands for research, the behavioural function of mammalian GABAB1 receptor isoforms has been inscrutable. Recently mice deficient in GABAB(1a) and GABAB(1b) isoforms were generated. Aspects of anxiety- and depression-related behaviour may be modelled in mice, by using traditional animal models, and by examining specific biological and behavioural components of the human symptomatology, or \u2018endophenotypes\u2019. A preliminary aim of this thesis was to determine the utility of GABAB(1) isoform-deficient mice for the dissection of GABAB(1a) and GABAB(1b) isoform-mediated behaviour. The main aim of this thesis was to test the hypothesis, using a combination of traditional and endophenotype murine models, that GABAB(1) receptor isoforms play an important role in the mediation and anxiety and depression-related behaviour. \n \n \nGABAB(1) Isoforms in GABAB Receptor Function: \nPreparatory work in this thesis examined the influence of genetic background on GABAB receptor-mediated responses. Genetic background, in the form of different mouse strains, had a strong, differential effect on the classic responses to GABAB receptor activation; hypothermia and ataxia. This underlined the necessity of including multiple experimental endpoints in the examination of GABAB receptor function in subsequent work with GABAB(1) isoform-deficient mice. Importantly, this study also demonstrated that the BALB/c mouse strain was an appropriate genetic background for carrying the GABAB(1) isoform mutations. \n \nInitial studies with GABAB(1) isoform-deficient mice demonstrated that they were free of gross sensory-motor deficits that may preclude their application in behavioural tasks. Furthermore, GABAB(1a) and GABAB(1b) diverged in their influences on locomotor responses to novelty and circadian activity, although the GABAB receptor agonists baclofen or \u03b3-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) were not specific for either isoform and were unable to discriminate these differences. These findings demonstrated that the GABAB(1) isoforms had differential influences on behaviour. Together these studies demonstrated that the GABAB(1a)-/- and GABAB(1b)-/- mice were applicable for testing the hypothesis that the GABAB(1) isoforms were differentially implicated in anxiety and depression related behaviour. \n \nGABAB(1) Isoforms in Endophenotypes of Anxiety and Depression: \nDeletion of GABAB(1a) and GABAB(1b) isoforms had profound, differential impacts on the acquisition (GABAB(1a)) and extinction (GABAB(1b)) of aversive memories, as determined in a conditioned taste aversion paradigm. These effects, however, were not accompanied by differences in innate anxiety, as assessed in a comprehensive test battery of unconditioned anxiety tests, including autonomic (stress-induced hyperthermia), active (marble burying) and passive exploratory avoidance (staircase, light-dark box, elevated plus maze, elevated zero maze) behavioural readouts. There was no evidence for a specific influence of either isoform in these tests. This indicated that the GABAB(1) isoforms themselves did not have a defining role in innate anxiety. \nGABAB(1a)-/- and GABAB(1b)-/- mice diverged in their cognitive phenotypes. GABAB(1a)-/- mice were impaired in tasks of working spatial and recognition memory, but not in passive avoidance. GABAB(1b)-/- mice were also impaired, to a lesser degree, in a working spatial memory task, but showed preservation of working recognition memory and passive avoidance. Long term recognition memory, however, was also impaired in these mice. \nThe GABAB(1a) isoform was specifically implicated in depression-related behaviour, as indicated by reduced immobility in a classic test of antidepressant-like behaviour \u2013 the forced swim test. This was most probably mediated via the striking interactions of the GABAB(1a) isoform with the serotonergic system, as illustrated in particular by the profound desensitisation of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in GABAB(1a)-/- mice. A lack of effect on 5-HT1A receptor expression in GABAB(1a)-/- mice, as indicated by normal 5-HT1A autoradiography densities, suggested an intracellular mechanism for this desensitisation. \n \nTogether these studies demonstrated that the GABAB(1) isoforms are functionally important variants of the GABAB receptor, with specific relevance in depression and to aversive learning and memory processes that underlie cognitive symptoms in anxiety disorders.", "citedAbstract": "B-type receptors for the neurotransmitter GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid) inhibit neuronal activity through G-protein-coupled second-messenger systems, which regulate the release of neurotransmitters and the activity of ion channels and adenylyl cyclase. Physiological and biochemical studies show that there are differences in drug efficiencies at different GABAB receptors, so it is expected that GABAB-receptor (GABABR) subtypes exist. Two GABAB-receptor splice variants have been cloned (GABABR1a and GABABR1b), but native GABAB receptors and recombinant receptors showed unexplained differences in agonist-binding potencies. Moreover, the activation of presumed effector ion channels in heterologous cells expressing the recombinant receptors proved difficult,. Here we describe a new GABAB receptor subtype, GABABR2, which does not bind available GABAB antagonists with measurable potency. GABABR1a, GABABR1b and GABABR2 alone do not activate Kir3-type potassium channels efficiently, but co-expression of these receptors yields a robust coupling to activation of Kir3 channels. We provide evidence for the assembly of heteromeric GABAB receptors in vivo and show that GABABR2 and GABABR1a/b proteins immunoprecipitate and localize together at dendritic spines. The heteromeric receptor complexes exhibit a significant increase in agonist- and partial-agonist-binding potencies as compared with individual receptors and probably represent the predominant native GABAB receptor.

Threshold is variable, and in many types of neurons there is a relationship between the threshold voltage and the rate of rise of the membrane potential (dVm/dt) leading to the spike. In primary sensory cortex this relationship enhances the sensitivity of neurons to a particular stimulus feature. While Na+ channel inactivation may contribute to this relationship, recent evidence indicates that K+ currents located in the spike initiation zone are crucial. Here we used a simple Hodgkin-Huxley biophysical model to systematically investigate the role of K+ and Na+ current parameters (activation voltages and kinetics) in regulating spike threshold as a function of dVm/dt. Threshold was determined empirically and not estimated from the shape of the Vm prior to a spike. This allowed us to investigate intrinsic currents and values of gating variables at the precise voltage threshold. We found that Na+ inactivation is sufficient to produce the relationship provided it occurs at hyperpolarized voltages combined with slow kinetics. Alternatively, hyperpolarization of the K+ current activation voltage, even in the absence of Na+ inactivation, is also sufficient to produce the relationship. This hyperpolarized shift of K+ activation allows an outward current prior to spike initiation to antagonize the Na+ inward current such that it becomes self-sustaining at a more depolarized voltage. Our simulations demonstrate parameter constraints on Na+ inactivation and the biophysical mechanism by which an outward current regulates spike threshold as a function of dVm/dt.", "citedAbstract": "A slowly inactivating, low-threshold K(+) current has been implicated in the regulation of state transitions and repetitive activity in striatal medium spiny neurons. However, the molecular identity of the channels underlying this current and their biophysical properties remain to be clearly determined. Because previous work had suggested this current arose from Kv1 family channels, high-affinity toxins for this family were tested for their ability to block whole cell K(+) currents activated by depolarization of acutely isolated neurons. alpha-Dendrotoxin, which blocks channels containing Kv1.1, Kv1.2, or Kv1.6 subunits, decreased currents evoked by depolarization. Three other Kv1 family toxins that lack a high affinity for Kv1.2 subunits, r-agitoxin-2, dendrotoxin-K, and r-margatoxin, failed to significantly reduce currents, implicating channels with Kv1.2 subunits. RT-PCR results confirmed the expression of Kv1.2 mRNA in identified medium spiny neurons. Currents attributable to Kv1.2 channels activated rapidly, inactivated slowly, and recovered from inactivation slowly. In the subthreshold range (ca. -60 mV), these currents accounted for as much as 50% of the depolarization-activated K(+) current. Moreover, their rapid activation and relatively slow deactivation suggested that they contribute to spike afterpotentials regulating repetitive discharge. This inference was confirmed in current-clamp recordings from medium spiny neurons in the slice preparation where Kv1.2 blockade reduced first-spike latency and increased discharge frequency evoked from hyperpolarized membrane potentials resembling the \"down-state\" found in vivo.

Further, stimulation of parietotemporal cortex improves reading skill in lower ability adults.

To test this hypothesis, we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to manipulate parietotemporal function in adult readers as they learned a novel artificial orthography with new grapheme-phoneme mappings.

Learning of the artificial orthography was assessed at a pre-training baseline session, the end of each of the three training sessions, an immediate post-training session and a delayed post-training session about 4 weeks after training. Stimulation interacted with baseline reading skill to affect learning of trained words and transfer to untrained words. Lower skill readers showed better acquisition, whereas higher skill readers showed worse acquisition, when training was paired with real stimulation, as compared to readers who received sham stimulation. However, readers of all skill levels showed better maintenance of trained material following parietotemporal stimulation, indicating a differential effect of stimulation on initial learning and consolidation.

By introducing an interpolated interfering task very marked decrements in recall can be produced in a few minutes in the laboratory.

Generation of this proper spatial regulation requires that individual proteins be targeted to specific substructures within the spindle. For example, the kinesin-related protein CENP-E is targeted specifically to the corona fibers of kinetochores (Yao et al., 1997) where its action is required during alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate (Schaar et al., 1997; Wood et al., 1997). In contrast, the protein NuMA (nuclear mitotic antigen) is concentrated at spindle poles where its activity appears to be required for the focused organization of microtubules (Gaglio et al., 1995). The vertebrate mitotic spindle pole is a microtubuledependent region surrounding the centrioles and centrosome at each of the two ends of the bipolar mitotic spindle. NuMA, \u03b3tubulin and katanin are proteins whose localization define the spindle pole. NuMA associates exclusively with the microtubule-dependent spindle pole during mitosis and does not associate with interphase centrosomes (Price and Pettijohn, 1986; Dionne et al., 1999). In contrast, localization of \u03b3-tubulin to the interphase or mitotic centrosome does not require intact microtubules (Khodjakov and Rieder, 1999; Stearns et al., 1991; Zheng et al., 1991). However, localization of additional \u03b3-tubulin that surrounds the centrosomes only during mitosis does require microtubules (McNally and Thomas, 1998; Khodjakov and Rieder, 1999). Like NuMA, the sea urchin protein, katanin, is concentrated in a microtubule-dependent structure surrounding the \u03b3-tubulin at the poles of embryonic spindles (McNally et al., 1996). Antibodies recognizing mammalian homologs of katanin also recognize large microtubule-dependent structures surrounding \u03b3-tubulin foci at spindle poles in several cell types and, in addition, recognize a smaller microtubule-independent focus at the centrosome in some cell types (McNally and Thomas, 1998). Sea urchin katanin severs microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner in vitro (McNally and Vale, 1993) and is thought to be important in releasing microtubules from their centrosomal attachment points in vivo. Indeed, microinjection of antibodies recognizing a vertebrate katanin homolog into neurons results in the accumulation of microtubules attached to the centrosome (Ahmad et al., 1999), indicating that katanin-mediated microtubule severing is responsible for the release of microtubules from the neuronal centrosome. The concentration of katanin in mitotic spindle poles (McNally and Thomas, 1998) and the specific activation of katanin\u2019s activity in Mphase Xenopus extracts (Vale, 1991; McNally and Thomas, 1998) suggest that katanin may also sever microtubules from their centrosomal attachments during mitosis in non-neuronal cells. Katanin\u2019s localization in spindle poles may increase the efficiency of this centrosomal release reaction and thus allow 1623 Journal of Cell Science 113, 1623-1633 (2000) Printed in Great Britain \u00a9 The Company of Biologists Limited 2000 JCS1028", "citedAbstract": "Microtubules are dynamic structures whose proper rearrangement during the cell cycle is essential for the positioning of membranes during interphase and for chromosome segregation during mitosis.

However, the isolation of three different microtubule-severing proteins, p56, EF1alpha, and katanin, has only confused the issue because none of these proteins is directly activated by cyclin B/cdc2. Here we use immunodepletion with antibodies specific for a vertebrate katanin homologue to demonstrate that katanin is responsible for the majority of M-phase severing activity in Xenopus eggs.

We conducted a general population historical cohort study in all Australian States and Territories to establish the risk of TB arising in people on chronic hemo- or peritoneal dialysis. Methodology/Principal Findings Cases of TB disease in patients receiving chronic dialysis were identified by record linkage using the Australia & New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) and State and Territory TB notification databases 2001 to 2006. Main outcome measure was the relative risk of TB in people on dialysis, adjusted for TB incidence in country of birth, sex, age and indigenous status. A total of 6,276 cases of active TB were reported among 19,855,283 people living in Australia between 2001 and 2006. Among 14,506 patients on dialysis, 37 had a notification for TB disease after commencing dialysis, of whom 28 were culture positive. The incidence of TB was 66.8/100,000/year (95% CI 47.7 to 93.2) among people on dialysis and 5.7/100,000/year (95% CI 5.5 to 5.8) in the general population. The adjusted relative risk (aRR) of TB in people on dialysis was 7.8 (95% CI 3.3 to 18.7), and the aRR of culture positive TB was 8.6 (95% CI 3.9 to 19.3).

MMAV and DMAV are also metabolites of inorganic arsenic, formed intracellularly, primarily in liver cells in a metabolic process of repeated reductions and oxidative methylations. Inorganic arsenic is a known human carcinogen, inducing tumors of the skin, urinary bladder, and lung. However, a good animal model has not yet been found. Although the metabolic process of inorganic arsenic appears to enhance the excretion of arsenic from the body, it also involves formation of methylated compounds of trivalent arsenic as intermediates. Trivalent arsenicals (whether inorganic or organic) are highly reactive compounds that can cause cytotoxicity and indirect genotoxicity in vitro. DMAV was found to be a bladder carcinogen only in rats and only when administered in the diet or drinking water at high doses. It was negative in a two-year bioassay in mice. MMAV was negative in 2-year bioassays in rats and mice. The mode of action for DMAV-induced bladder cancer in rats appears to not involve DNA reactivity, but rather involves cytotoxicity with consequent regenerative proliferation, ultimately leading to the formation of carcinoma. This critical review responds to the question of whether DMAV-induced bladder cancer in rats can be extrapolated to humans, based on detailed comparisons between inorganic and organic arsenicals, including their metabolism and disposition in various animal species. The further metabolism and disposition of MMAV and DMAV formed endogenously during the metabolism of inorganic arsenic is different from the metabolism and disposition of MMAV and DMAV from exogenous exposure. The trivalent arsenicals that are cytotoxic and indirectly genotoxic in vitro are hardly formed in an organism exposed to MMAV or DMAV because of poor cellular uptake and limited metabolism of the ingested compounds. Furthermore, the evidence strongly supports a nonlinear dose-response relationship for the biologic processes involved in the carcinogenicity of arsenicals.

At a dose of 100 micromol/L, EGCG abrogates p300-induced p65 acetylation in vitro and in vivo, increases the level of cytosolic IkappaBalpha, and suppresses tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-induced NF-kappaB activation. We also showed that EGCG prevents TNFalpha-induced p65 translocation to the nucleus, confirming that hyperacetylation is critical for NF-kappaB translocation as well as activity. Furthermore, EGCG treatment inhibited the acetylation of p65 and the expression of NF-kappaB target genes in response to diverse stimuli. Finally, EGCG reduced the binding of p300 to the promoter region of interleukin-6 gene with an increased recruitment of HDAC3, which highlights the importance of the balance between HATs and histone deacetylases in the NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) provides such a tool where measurements are performed non-invasively at numerous locations surrounding the head. The high sensitivity of Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUID) utilized by current MEG systems combined with advanced hardware and software noise cancellation techniques allow the detection of minute magnetic fields generated by electrical neural activity with good accuracy. The ability to directly observe the neuronal fields allows MEG to have millisecond time resolution, orders of magnitude higher than the time resolution of fMRI and PET. While the electrical signals measured by electroencephalography (EEG) are strongly influenced by inhomogeneities in the head, the magnetic fields measured by MEG are produced mainly by current flow in the relatively homogenous intracranial space, permitting more accurate spatial localization (Hamalainen et al. 1993). Although electromagnetic fields are fully described by Maxwell\u2019s equations, the problem of obtaining the spatiotemporal distributions of the neural current generators from MEG data (referred to as the inverse problem) poses a challenge since it is inherently ill-defined (Hamalainen et al., 1993). Since the neural current generators lie within the human head, a conducting medium, it is not possible to develop a mathematical model that provides a unique solution. Instead, several methods with different assumptions have been developed, each of which has its own advantages and limitations (Pascarella et al., 2010; Sekihara and Nagarajan, 2008; Wipf and Nagarajan, 2009). Generally, inverse models in MEG can be separated into two classes: parametric models and imaging models. Parametric models are global solutions that attempt to account for the measured fields in their entirety in terms of a small number of sources. The most popular model in this class is the equivalent current dipole model (ECD), where non-linear leastsquare fits are used to estimate the parameters of the current dipoles requiring the number of sources to be known a priori, and are not easily able to reconstruct spatially distributed or extended sources. More advanced techniques have been developed in this class such as", "citedAbstract": "Adaptive spatial filters (beamformers) have gained popularity as an effective method for the localization of brain activity from magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Among the attractive features of some beamforming methods are high spatial resolution and no localization bias even in the presence of random noise. A drawback common to all beamforming methods, however, is significant degradation in performance in the presence of sources with high temporal correlations. Using numerical simulations and examples of auditory and visual evoked field responses, we demonstrate that, at typical signal-to-noise levels, the complete attenuation of fully correlated brain activity is less likely to occur, although significant localization and amplitude biases may occur. We compared various methods for correcting these biases and found the coherent source suppression model (CSSM) (Dalal et al., 2006) to be the most effective, with small biases for widely separated sources (e.g., bilateral auditory areas), however, amplitude biases increased systematically as distance between the sources was decreased. We assessed the performance and systematic biases that may result from the use of this model, and confirmed our findings with real examples of correlated brain activity in bilateral occipital and inferior temporal areas evoked by visually presented faces in a group of 21 adults. We demonstrated the ability to localize source activity in both regions, including correlated sources that are in close proximity ( approximately 3 cm) in bilateral primary visual cortex when using a priori information regarding source location. We conclude that CSSM, when carefully applied, can significantly improve localization accuracy, although amplitude biases may remain.", "citingTitle": "4 Characterization of Brain Dynamics Using Beamformer Techniques : Advantages and Limitations", "citedTitle": "Reconstruction of correlated brain activity with adaptive spatial filters in MEG"}

The purpose of this work was to validate a software designed to measure the principal parameters involved in sagittal balance of the spine.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nSix parameters (lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, sagittal tilt at T9, pelvic index, pelvic tilt, slope of the sacrum) were measured on lateral views of the spine from 100 healthy volunteers free of any spinal disease. Two measurement techniques were used: manual measurement and automatic computerized measurement with this software. We hypothesized that manual measures could be accepted as reference values because they are currently the most widely used and because the computerized measurements were obtained using digitalized images that may have modified interpretation. The software was therefore validated by comparing the angles measured manually with the computer output. Inter- and intraobserver coefficients of variation were calculated for the two measurement techniques. One operator performed both series of measurements (manual and computerized). Two other operators preformed two series of independent measures using one of the measurement techniques. Finally, two new operators performed a complete series of measurements using both measurement techniques. Comparisons were performed with the t test for paired variables with calculation of the coefficients of correlation. Intraclass coefficients of correlation were determined for inter- and intra-observer variability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was an excellent correlation between the manual measurements and the computerized measurements with intra-class coefficients of correlation varying from 0.82 to 0.96. Inter- and intra-observer variabilities were comparable for the two measurement techniques used to determine thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, pelvic index, pelvic tilt, and slope of the sacrum. Inter- and intra-observer variability was lower when the sagittal tilt was measured with the software specially designed.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis comparison between two techniques for measuring pelvic and spinal parameters of sagittal balance of the spine demonstrated a good correlation between manual and the computerized measurements obtained with the software to be evaluated. Computer-assisted measurements not only provided a saving in time but also minimized inter- and intra-observer variability for the estimation of certain parameters.", "citingTitle": "Patients with spinal deformity over the age of 75: a retrospective analysis of operative versus non-operative management", "citedTitle": "[Validation of a tool to measure pelvic and spinal parameters of sagittal balance]."}

To improve quantification accuracy in such difficult cases, we developed a novel computational method, prior-enhanced RSEM (pRSEM), which uses a complementary data type in addition to RNA-seq data. We found that ChIP-seq data of RNA polymerase II and histone modifications were particularly informative in this approach.

Experimental studies on adult krill have demonstrated that specific physiological adaptations during autumn and winter, such as reduced metabolic rates and feeding activity, are not caused simply by the scarcity of food, as was previously assumed. These adaptations appear to be influenced by the local light regime. The physiological functions that larval krill adopt during winter (reduced metabolism, delayed development, lipid utilisation, and variable growth rates) are, in contrast to the adults, under direct control by the available food supply. During winter, the adults often seem to have little association with sea ice (at least until early spring). The larvae, however, feed within sea ice but mainly on the grazers of the ice algal community rather than on the algae themselves. In this respect, a miss-match in timing of the occurrence of the last phytoplankton blooms in autumn and the start of the sea ice formation, as has been increasingly observed in the west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region, will impact larval krill development during winter in terms of food supply and consequently the krill stock in this region.", "citedAbstract": "A long-term study on the maturity cycle of Antarctic krill was conducted in a research aquarium.

Several studies have documented effects of UV-B-induced changes in plant tissue quality on the feeding performance of insect larvae. In contrast, the effects of UV-B-induced plant responses on the behavior of adult insects have received little attention. We carried out a series of field and glasshouse experiments using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana L. and the crucifer-specialist insect Plutella xylostella L. (diamondback moth) to investigate the effects of UV-B on natural herbivory and plant\u2013insect interactions. Natural herbivory under field conditions was less severe on plants exposed to ambient UV-B than on plants grown under filters that attenuated the UV-B component of solar radiation. This reduced herbivory could not be accounted for by effects of UV-B on larval feeding preference and performance, as P. xylostella caterpillars did not respond to changes in plant quality induced by UV-B. In contrast, at the adult stage, the insects presented clear behavioral responses: P. xylostella moths deposited significantly more eggs on plants grown under attenuated UV-B levels than on plants exposed to ambient UV-B. The deterring effect of UV-B exposure on insect oviposition was absent in jar1-1, a mutant with impaired jasmonic acid (JA) sensitivity, but it was conserved in mutants with altered ethylene signaling. The jar1-1 mutant also presented reduced levels of UV-absorbing phenolic compounds than the other genotypes that we tested. Our results suggest that variations in UV-B exposure under natural conditions can have significant effects on insect herbivory by altering plant traits that female adults use as sources of information during the process of host selection for oviposition. These effects of natural UV-B on plant quality appear to be mediated by activation of signaling circuits in which the defense-related hormone JA plays a functional role.", "citedAbstract": "We examined the effects of solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation on plant-insect interactions in Tierra del Fuego (55\u00b0S), Argentina, an area strongly affected by ozone depletion because of its proximity to Antarctica.

The plastic films were placed on both north-facing (i.e., high solar radiation in the Southern Hemisphere) and south-facing branches. Insects consumed 40% less leaf area from north- than from south-facing branches, and at least 30% less area from uvb+ branches than from uvb\u2212 branches. The reduced herbivory on leaves from uvb+ branches occurred for both branch orientations. Leaf mass per area increased and relative water content decreased on north- versus south-facing branches, while no differences were apparent between the UV-B treatments. Solar UV-B did lead to lower gallic acid concentration and higher flavonoid aglycone concentration in uvb+ leaves relative to uvb\u2212 leaves.

A key feature of our approach is that it combines the fortes of both bug-driven and change-aware techniques, which enables it to effectively verify synchronizations by testing only a minimal set of suspicious atomicity violations without any knowledge on the to-be-isolated work units, thus being more efficient and practical than other approaches. Besides, unlike existing approaches, our approach effectively utilizes all the inferred execution traces even they may not be completely feasible, such that the verification algorithm can converge much faster. We demonstrate via extensive evaluation that our approach is much more effective and efficient than the state-of-the-arts. Besides, we show that although there have existed sound automatic fixing techniques for atomicity violations, our approach is still necessary and useful for quality assurance of concurrent programs, because the assumption behind our approach is much weaker.

Paternal care is expected when providing care enhances offspring survival and reproduction, which likewise increases fathers\u2019 fitness. Males might also care for unrelated immature individuals to increase their mating probability with the immature individuals\u2019 mothers. Studies in multimale primate groups showed that sires enhance food access for offspring and provide protection in conflicts. Furthermore, fathers\u2019 presence during infancy has been suggested to accelerate offspring sexual maturation. However, no study has yet directly linked the degree of father-offspring bonds to offspring fitness in primates. We previously reported father-offspring affiliation in rhesus macaques, pronounced during early infancy and independent of mothers\u2019 presence. The present study aims at investigating whether affiliation with fathers or other males affects proxies of immature fitness (body mass gain, body fat and testis size). First, we combined behavioral, genetic and morphometric data from 55 subjects of one group. Second, using demographic and genetic data, we investigated for 92 individuals of the population whether mother- and father-offspring co-residence during immaturity influenced offspring lifetime reproductive success (LRS). Our results show that focal rank and higher amounts of affiliation with high-ranking males during infancy tend to positively impact body mass gain of female, but not male focal animals. In contrast, body mass gain of male focal individuals, but not females\u2019, appeared to be higher when affiliation of male immature individuals was evenly distributed across their adult male partners. Moreover, we found mothers\u2019, but not fathers\u2019, presence during immaturity to predict offspring LRS.

We examined the relationship between mating activity, paternity and friendships over a 3-year period. A male\u2019s proportion of consort activity with a female within and outside of her period of most likely conception, along with his dominance rank, each contributed importantly in models of paternity outcomes and formation of friendships.

When the primary consort partner was absent at parturition, females formed friendships with males that had monopolized the second or third greatest proportion of their previous consort days. Similarly, 78% of males became friends with females with whom they had obtained their greatest consort success. Such a flexible strategy based on probabilistic assessment of paternity may be adaptive for females, given unpredictable fluctuations in male presence within the group.

This phenomenon is referred to as stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA). SSA has been investigated extensively using oddball experiments, which measure the responses of a neuron to sequences of stimuli. Neurons that exhibit SSA respond less vigorously to common stimuli, and the metric typically used to quantify this difference is the SSA index (SI). This article presents the first detailed analysis of the SI metric by examining the question: How should a system (e.g., a neuron) respond to stochastic input if it is to maximize the SI of its output? Questions like this one are particularly relevant to those wishing to construct computational models of SSA. If an artificial neural network receives stimulus information at a particular rate and must respond within a fixed time, what is the highest SI one can reasonably expect?

Aim To examine the one-year mortality in COPD patients after severe exacerbation and the correlation between mortality and patients\u2019 characteristics and comorbidities. Methods A total of 152 COPD patients hospitalized for severe exacerbation were assessed for vitamin D status, diabetes mellitus (DM), arterial hypertension (AH), and metabolic syndrome (MS). Data were gathered about smoking status and number of exacerbations in previous year. CAT and mMRC questionnaires were completed by all patients. Pre- and post-bronchodilatory spirometry was performed. One-year mortality was established from national death register. Results One-year mortality is 7.2%.

Following epidermal growth factor stimulation, cyclin D1 was upregulated at time points corresponding to the mitogen restriction point, and this was associated with enhanced cyclin D1-associated kinase activity. To test whether cyclin D1 expression was sufficient to promote mitogen-independent progression through the G1-S transition, we constructed a replication-defective adenovirus that overexpressed human cyclin D1. Transfection with the cyclin D1 vector but not a control vector resulted in hepatocyte DNA synthesis in the absence of growth factor that was similar to that seen in mitogen-treated cells. Furthermore, cyclin D1 transfection led to activation of downstream biochemical events, including cyclin A and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and cyclin E- and cyclin A-associated kinase activation.

We then assessed the relationship between the evoked amplitudes of contralateral PBR and ipsilateral NBR at the level of both single-trial and average responses. We measure single-trial PBR and NBR peak amplitudes from individual time-courses, and show that they were positively correlated in all experiments. In contrast, in the average response across trials the absolute magnitudes of both PBR and NBR increased with increasing stimulus intensity, resulting in a negative correlation between mean response amplitudes. Subsequent analysis showed that the amplitude of single-trial PBR was positively correlated with the BOLD response across all grey-matter voxels and was not specifically related to the ipsilateral sensory cortical response. We demonstrate that the global component of this single-trial response modulation could be fully explained by voxel-wise vascular reactivity, the BOLD signal standard deviation measured in a separate resting-state scan (resting state fluctuation amplitude, RSFA). However, bilateral positive correlation between PBR and NBR regions remained. We further report that modulations in the global brain fMRI signal cannot fully account for this positive PBR-NBR coupling and conclude that the local sensory network response reflects a combination of superimposed vascular and neuronal signals.

The challenge is to alter differentiation toward functional cell types or tissues by directing ES cells to a specific fate. Efforts have been made to understand the molecular mechanisms that are required for the formation of the different germ layers and tissues from ES cells, and these mechanisms appear to be very similar in the mouse embryo. Differentiation toward mesoderm and mesoderm derivatives such as cardiac tissue or hemangioblasts has been demonstrated; however, the roles of Activin A/Nodal, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling in the early patterning of ES cell-derived pan-mesoderm and anterior visceral endoderm (aVE) have not been reported yet. We therefore analyzed the roles of Activin A/Nodal, BMP, and FGF signaling in the patterning of ES cell-derived mesoderm as well as specification of the aVE by using a dual ES cell differentiation system combining a loss-of-function with a gain-of-function approach. We found that Activin A or Nodal directed the nascent mesoderm toward axial mesoderm and mesendoderm, while Bmp4 was inducing posterior and extraembryonic mesoderm at the expense of anterior primitive streak cells. FGF signaling appeared to have an important role in mesoderm differentiation by allowing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of the newly formed mesoderm cells that would lead to their further patterning. Moreover, inhibition of FGF signaling resulted in increased expression of axial mesoderm markers. Additionally, we revealed that the formation of aVE cells from ES cells requires FGF-dependent Activin A/Nodal signaling and the attenuation of Bmp4 signaling.", "citedAbstract": "The vertebrate Fgf8 gene produces multiple protein isoforms by alternative splicing. Two evolutionarily conserved spliceforms, Fgf8a and Fgf8b, exhibit distinct bioactivities, with Fgf8b having a more potent inductive activity due to higher affinity for Fgf receptors. To investigate the in vivo requirement for Fgf8b, we created a splice-site mutation abolishing Fgf8b expression in mice. Analysis of this mutant has uncovered a novel function of Fgf8 signaling before the onset of gastrulation. We show that the loss of Fgf8b disrupts the induction of the brachyury gene in the pregastrular embryo and, in addition, disrupts the proper alignment of the anteroposterior axis with the shape of the embryo and the uterine axes at embryonic day (E) 6.5. Importantly, Fgf8-null embryos display the same phenotype as Fgf8b-deficient embryos at E6.5, demonstrating that signaling by Fgf8b is specifically required for development of the pregastrular embryo. By contrast, during gastrulation, Fgf8a can partially compensate for the loss of Fgf8b in mesoderm specification. We show that an increased level of Fgf8a expression, which leads to Fgf4 expression in the primitive streak, can also promote mesoderm migration in the absence of Fgf8b. Therefore, different Fgf signals may have distinct requirements for the morphogenesis and gene regulation before and during gastrulation. Importantly, our findings implicate Fgf8 in the morphogenetic process that establishes the defined relationship between the axes of the embryo and the uterus at the beginning of gastrulation, a perplexing phenomenon discovered two decades ago.", "citingTitle": "Patterning of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived pan-mesoderm by Activin A/Nodal and Bmp4 signaling requires Fibroblast Growth Factor activity.", "citedTitle": "Distinct functions of the major Fgf8 spliceform, Fgf8b, before and during mouse gastrulation"}

This reflects in the types of experimental tasks that have been proposed in recent years for the assessment of ToM in normal and abnormal populations, some of which focus on the ability to understand visual or other perceptual cues as hints to another individual\u2019s mental states (e.g., Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill, Raste, & Plumb 2001; Rutherford, Baron-Cohen, & Wheelwright, 2002; Golan, Baron-Cohen, Hill, & Rutherford, 2007) and others on the comprehension of complex mental states as encapsulated in short stories or linguistic questions (e.g., Baron-Cohen, O\u2019Riordan, Stone, Jones & Plaitsed, 1999; Happ\u00e9, 1994; Pons & Harris, 2000). Let us discriminate two facets of labels like ToM or mindreading. One is the situated ability to understand and react to someone\u2019s mental states (\u2018\u2018this thug is planning to assault me \u2013 I had better let him see that I carry a knife\u201d); roughly, it is manifestations of this facet that are explored by the first type of experimental tasks mentioned above. Another is the retrospective reconsideration of one\u2019s own or another individual\u2019s ways or ability to cope with mentalistic social cognition (\u2018\u2018I always feel in danger when people conceal their thoughts\u201d); again roughly, it is manifestations of this facet that are explored by the second type of tasks. Each facet may be further analyzed according to more detailed considerations like the distinction between an egocentric and an allocentric perspective or between the various types of epistemic, volitional and other mental states that humans may understand. Particularly in developmental psychology, the difference between on-line and retrospective aspects of ToM has also been compared to the distinction between implicit and explicit knowledge or functioning of ToM (e.g., Clements & Perner, 1994); however, the latter distinction is often used intuitively, leaving many theoretical questions open (Dienes & Perner, 1999). To sum up, ToM may be viewed as a sophisticated mental activity which allows to quickly form and handle local, situated ideas about oneself or the others in a specific moment as well as more general, less transient ideas about how one and the others tend to live and cope across any number of different and possibly hypothetical situations. Both facets of ToM have been a focus of research, but, to our knowledge, the conceptual and theoretical relations between them have never been worked out to any satisfactory level of detail and, as discussed above, the experimental paradigms with which they have been studied are quite different. The Th.o.m.a.s. interview (Bosco et al., 2009) is meant to investigate the retrospective facet of ToM, based on a theoretically-driven decomposition thereof that aims at bringing its diversity and complexity into light. There is no way of doing this without recurring to the interviewee\u2019s deliberate introspection and discursive abilities. It is possible that, as Badgaiyan (2009) suggests, schizophrenia might affect differently the two facets of ToM. Yet, there is no reason to think that either one has a systematically more important causal role than the other in the mental life of a healthy or schizophrenic person. Instead, they influence each other: the retrospective ability has to build in part upon the reconsideration of previous episodes and situations in which the on-line interpretation of mental states has yielded some interesting lesson to learn; conversely, the on-line interpretation of the current situation has to be informed in part by the individual\u2019s general worldview and biography as well as by the outcomes of and reflections upon situations met in the past. We believe that the retrospective facet of ToM plays a fundamental role and that it is crucial to our understanding of social cognition in schizophrenia and elsewhere. Another issue raised by Badgaiyan concerns the role that memory, language and IQ may play in ToM activities and in the relevant experimental tasks. Truly, certain such activities and tasks require an adequate level of non-ToM cognitive function-", "citingTitle": "Theory of mind deficit in subjects with alcohol use disorder: an analysis of mindreading processes.", "citedTitle": "Reply The complexity of theory of mind q"}

The kinetics of degradation of the substituted phenols suggest that the preferential order of their depletion could be due to their respective pKa values and that the dissociated phenolate ions are the substrates. A mutant strain (T99), with a disrupted hydroxyquinol dioxygenase gene in the previously described 4-chlorophenol degradation gene cluster, was also studied for its ability to grow on the different phenols. The mutant strain was able to grow on phenol, but not on either of the substituted phenols, suggesting a different catabolic pathway for the degradation of phenol by this microorganism.", "citedAbstract": "ABSTRACT Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus A6, a previously described 4-chlorophenol-degrading strain, was found to degrade 4-chlorophenol via hydroxyquinol, which is a novel route for aerobic microbial degradation of this compound. In addition, 10 open reading frames exhibiting sequence similarity to genes encoding enzymes involved in chlorophenol degradation were cloned and designated part of a chlorophenol degradation gene cluster (cph genes). Several of the open reading frames appeared to encode enzymes with similar functions; these open reading frames included two genes, cphA-I and cphA-II, which were shown to encode functional hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenases. Disruption of the cphA-I gene yielded a mutant that exhibited negligible growth on 4-chlorophenol, thereby linking the cph gene cluster to functional catabolism of 4-chlorophenol in A. chlorophenolicus A6. The presence of a resolvase pseudogene in the cph gene cluster together with analyses of the G+C content and codon bias of flanking genes suggested that horizontal gene transfer was involved in assembly of the gene cluster during evolution of the ability of the strain to grow on 4-chlorophenol.", "citingTitle": "Degradation of mixtures of phenolic compounds by Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus A6", "citedTitle": "Novel 4-Chlorophenol Degradation Gene Cluster and Degradation Route via Hydroxyquinol in Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus A6"}

It is identified by its rapid, invasive progression with a profound resistance to treatments such as chemotherapy. Unfortunately, there is a lack of information on how to effectively inhibit and control the rapid growth of pancreatic tumors, as well as limited information for diagnostics. With current methods, pancreatic cancer will continue to prevail as a leading cause of cancer death. We propose to study the complexity of pancreatic tumors with a systematic and analytical approach. Cancer is an abnormal growth of tissue caused by uncontrolled cell division. Observing the growth of these cells would prove to have a good basis to monitor the growth of a tumor. Here we create a 3-D simulation of tumor growth through mathematical modeling, using data from pancreatic cells grown in vitro. Using 3-D models will help to understand pancreatic tumors at cellular and molecular levels. The project aims to observe realistic growth of the tumor, accomplished from growing tumor cells on a monolayer in order to find parameters for our 3D mathematical model. This method will prove more beneficial than testing only on a monolayer cell line. Although cell death and the toxicity of drug dosage can be tested using a cell monolayer alone, it does not meet the demands of testing drug delivery in a realistic tumor environment that the mathematical model would provide. The monolayer lacks the dimensions that the drug would have to travel if it were delivered to a real in vivo tumor. A possible continuation of this project in the future could be to utilize the mathematical based approach to predict optimal therapy for the pancreatic tumor in order to develop models that can better test patient care for tumors. Computer modeling, another stepping stone through mathematical modeling, will possibly lead to testing the toxic effects of drugs on a 3-D model through computer modeling will aid in understanding the delivery of drugs throughout the tumor in vivo.", "citedAbstract": "Abstract\u2002We study solid tumor (carcinoma) growth in the nonlinear regime using boundary-integral simulations. The tumor core is nonnecrotic and no inhibitor chemical species are present. A new formulation of the classical models [18,24,8,3] is developed and it is demonstrated that tumor evolution is described by a reduced set of two dimensionless parameters and is qualitatively unaffected by the number of spatial dimensions. One parameter describes the relative rate of mitosis to the relaxation mechanisms (cell mobility and cell-to-cell adhesion). The other describes the balance between apoptosis (programmed cell-death) and mitosis. Both parameters also include the effect of vascularization. Our analysis and nonlinear simulations reveal that the two new dimensionless groups uniquely subdivide tumor growth into three regimes associated with increasing degrees of vascularization: low (diffusion dominated, e.g., in vitro), moderate and high vascularization, that correspond to the regimes observed in vivo. We demonstrate that critical conditions exist for which the tumor evolves to nontrivial dormant states or grows self-similarly (i.e., shape invariant) in the first two regimes. This leads to the possibility of shape control and of controlling the release of tumor angiogenic factors by restricting the tumor volume-to-surface-area ratio. Away from these critical conditions, evolution may be unstable leading to invasive fingering into the external tissues and to topological transitions such as tumor breakup and reconnection. Interestingly we find that for highly vascularized tumors, while they grow unbounded, their shape always stays compact and invasive fingering does not occur. This is in agreement with recent experimental observations [30] of in vivo tumor growth, and suggests that the invasive growth of highly-vascularized tumors is associated to vascular and elastic anisotropies, which are not included in the model studied here.\n", "citingTitle": "Biomodeling of pancreatic tumor mass.", "citedTitle": "Nonlinear simulation of tumor growth"}

To identify other genes involved in bovicin HJ50 production, DNA fragments flanking bovA were cloned and sequenced. The bovicin HJ50 biosynthesis gene locus was encoded by a 9.9 kb region of chromosomal DNA and consisted of at least nine genes in the following order: bovA, -M, -T, -E, -F, ORF1, ORF2, bovK and bovR.

The present study was designed to elucidate the interaction between the proinflammatory cytokines interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) on iNOS expression and NO production in microglial cells. In primary mouse microglial cells exposure to IFN-gamma (5 and 10 ng/ml; 48 h) or TNF-alpha (20 ng/ml; 48 h) alone were unable to induce iNOS expression; however, when cells were exposed to both cytokines together, the expression of this enzyme and the NO production in culture media were found significantly increased. In the BV-2 microglial cell line, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were shown to cooperate in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation, an essential transcription factor for iNOS gene transcription. Importantly, IFN-gamma induced NF-kappa B binding to DNA was totally dependent on the endogenous TNF-alpha released via MEK/ERK signalling pathway. Thus, exposure of BV-2 cells to IFN-gamma in the presence of the selective MEK inhibitor U0126 or a neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha antibody significantly reduced IFN-gamma dependent NF-kappa B activation and iNOs expression. In addition, by activating the Jak/STAT pathway IFN-gamma potentiated TNF-alpha induced NF-kappa B binding to DNA and activated additional transcription factors (i.e. IRF-1) known to be essential for iNOs gene expression. The present findings demonstrate that the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha have complementary roles on iNOS expression in microglial cells and this might be relevant to understand the molecular mechanisms of microglial activation associated with the pathogenesis of several neuroinflammatory disorders in which increased levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha have been reported.", "citedAbstract": "We have reported recently that sodium butyrate suppressed IFN-gamma, but not the LPS-mediated induction of nitric oxide and TNF-alpha in microglia via the specific inhibition of NF-kappaB.

Sodium butyrate significantly repressed the phosphorylation of ERK induced by IFN-gamma, but had little effect on that induced by LPS. This suggests that sodium butyrate suppresses the IFN-gamma-induced iNOS expression by inhibiting the ERK to NF-kappaB pathway. In addition, it was found that sodium butyrate suppressed the IFN-gamma-induced interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) expression via the inhibition of ERK.

We find that the use of equal wages elicits substantially lower efforts. This is not caused by monetary incentives per se since under both wage schemes it is profit-maximizing for agents to exert high efforts. The treatment difference instead seems to be driven by the fact that the norm of equity is violated far more frequently in the equal wage treatment. After having suffered from violations of the equity principle, agents withdraw effort. These findings hold even after controlling for the role of intentions, as we show in a third treatment.

Finally, DPIV appears to play a critical role in mediating the protective effect of DP inhibitors.

Brain\u2013behavior correlations were explored using both network-level correlation analysis following independent component analysis (ICA) and voxel-level, brain-wide univariate correlation analysis. Variation in the attentional bias effect for cocaine use stimuli among cocaine-dependent men and women was related to the recruitment of two separate neural processing networks related to stimulus attention and salience attribution (inferior frontal\u2013parietal\u2013ventral insula), and the processing of the negative affective properties of cocaine stimuli (frontal\u2013temporal\u2013cingulate).

Nm serogroup B (NmB) vaccines are composed of antigens that are conserved across Nm serogroups and therefore have the potential to impact all Nm carriage. To assess the effect of these vaccines on carriage, standardized approaches to identify and group Nm are required. Real-time PCR (rt-PCR) capsule grouping assays that were internally controlled to confirm Nm species were developed for eight serogroups associated with carriage (A, B, C, E, W, X, Y and Z). The grouping scheme was validated using diverse bacterial species associated with carriage and then used to evaluate a collection of diverse Nm carriage isolates (n=234). A scheme that also included porA and ctrA probes was able to speciate the isolates, while ctrA also provided insights on the integrity of the polysaccharide loci.

Greater numbers of co-breeding kin had a positive effect on the number of offspring weaned, through the mechanism of altering energy allocation patterns. On average, females with higher numbers of co-breeding kin did not increase energy income but biased energy allocation towards reproduction. Co-breeding female kin ground squirrels maintain close nest burrows, likely providing a social buffer against territorial invasions from non-kin ground squirrels.

We applied an individual fitness approach to a 16-year study of Columbian ground squirrels (Urocitellus columbianus) to investigate potential causal paths by which the presence of kin might act on individual fitness. Our results indicate that individual fitness benefits resulted from associations of philopatric female kin, and support the hypothesis that increased tolerance of proximity of kin is a proximate mechanism for these benefits. The major life-history influence of kin on individual fitness was through improved reproductive success, and this benefit may have been owing to philopatric settlement of kin that were recognized through familiarization in the natal burrow.

Weak silencing effects were also induced by the ASP-IR construct harbouring allele-specific sequences covering the region from \u2212531 to \u2212330\u00a0bp relative to the TIS, but only in a low percentage (4\u20135.5%) of the transformants. These percentages are too low to distinguish effects between the two potato cultivars. Therefore, this approach cannot be used to induce allele-specific TGS. Strong silencing effects were obtained in 49% of the transformants harbouring the full promoter inverted repeat construct. This construct contained sequences from \u2212766 to +194\u00a0bp relative to the TIS. In the strongly silenced transformants no GBSSI mRNA could be detected by Northern blot analysis.

PTGS is induced by deliberate [1-4] or fortuitous production (R.v.B., unpublished data) of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). TGS could be the result of DNA pairing [5], but could also be the result of dsRNA, as was shown by the dsRNA-induced inactivation of a transgenic promoter [6]. Here, we show that when targeting flower pigmentation genes in Petunia, transgenes expressing dsRNA can induce PTGS when coding sequences are used and TGS when promoter sequences are taken. For both types of silencing, small RNA species are found, which are thought to be dsRNA decay products [7] and determine the sequence specificity of the silencing process [8, 9]. Furthermore, silencing is accompanied by the methylation of DNA sequences that are homologous to dsRNA. DNA methylation is assumed to be essential for regulating TGS and important for reinforcing PTGS [10]. Therefore, we conclude that TGS and PTGS are mechanistically related. In addition, we show that dsRNA-induced TGS provides an efficient tool to generate gene knockouts, because not only does the TGS of a PTGS-inducing transgene fully revert the PTGS phenotype, but also an endogenous gene can be transcriptionally silenced by dsRNA corresponding to its promoter.", "citingTitle": "Efficiency of transcriptional gene silencing of GBSSI in potato depends on the promoter region that is used in an inverted repeat", "citedTitle": "Transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene silencing are mechanistically related"}

Additionally, Cos2 recruits and transports other components of the Hh signaling pathway, including the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci). Drosophila expressing cos2 mutations that encode proteins that lack motility are attenuated in their ability to regulate Ci activity and exhibit phenotypes consistent with attenuated Cos2 function [9].

The exact kinematic and kinetic analysis of the finite deformations leads to an additive decomposition of the total strain rate into its elastic, damage and plastic constituents. The general structure of the expression for the damage strain rate is derived, valid for utilized damage tensors of any order. The analysis of elastoplastic deformation of elastically anisotropic materials without damage is also presented, with the application to transversely isotropic materials. The relationships between the elastic and plastic strain rates and the components of the multiplicative decomposition and their rates are also given.", "citedAbstract": "In this paper a scalar-valued isotropic tensor function is considered, the variables of which are constitutive tensors of orders two and four, for instance, characterizing the anisotropic properties of a material.

Each repair utterance was paired with the utterance preceding the staged recognition error and coded for adaptations associated with hyperarticulate speech: speaking rate and phonetically clear speech. Our results demonstrate that hyperarticulation is a targeted and flexible adaptation rather than a generalized and stable mode of speaking. Hyperarticulation increases after evidence of misrecognition and then decays gradually over several turns in the absence of further misrecognitions. When repairing misrecognized speech, speakers are more likely to clearly articulate constituents that were apparently misrecognized than those either before or after the troublesome constituents, and more likely to clearly articulate content words than function words.

Thirty-two non-native and 32 native listeners were presented with naturally produced English sentences. Factors that varied were speaking style (conversational versus clear), signal-to-noise ratio (-4 versus -8 dB) and talker (one male versus one female). Results showed that while native listeners derived a substantial benefit from naturally produced clear speech (an improvement of about 16 rau units on a keyword-correct count), non-native listeners exhibited only a small clear speech effect (an improvement of only 5 rau units).

This meta-analysis was aimed at assessing the effect and safety of methylphenidate on CRF. Methods We comprehensively searched the Pubmed, EMBASE, PSYCHInfo and the Cochrane databases in order to identify published studies on the effect of methylphenidate on CRF. Primary outcomes included fatigue. Secondary outcomes included depression, cognition and adverse effects. Findings A meta-analysis was conducted on five randomized controlled trials and 498 patients were enrolled.

Intravenous (IV) self-administration procedures are the gold standard for investigating the reinforcing effects of psychoactive drugs. The goal of this review was to examine the results of published investigations of the reinforcing effects of nicotine measured using IV self-administration procedures in humans and nonhuman primates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe body of literature using nonhuman primate subjects indicates nicotine functions as a positive reinforcer when available for self-administration via IV catheters. However, it can also be difficult to establish IV nicotine self-administration in nonhuman primates and sometimes supplemental strategies have been required (e.g., priming injections or food deprivation) before subjects acquire the behavior. Although the body of literature using human subjects is limited, the evidence indicates nicotine functions as a reinforcer via the IV route of administration in adult cigarette smokers. Rates of nicotine self-injection can be variable across subjects and responding is sometimes inconsistent across sessions in both humans and nonhuman primates.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, enacted in 2009, gave the Food and Drug Administration regulatory authority over the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products. Research examining the threshold reinforcing doses for initiation and maintenance of nicotine self-administration, comparisons of the reinforcing effects of nicotine in adolescent versus adult subjects, investigations of gender differences in the reinforcing effects of nicotine, and studies of the abuse liability of non-nicotine tobacco product constituents and their ability to alter the reinforcing effects of nicotine will inform potential tobacco regulatory actions.", "citingTitle": "Threshold dose for discrimination of nicotine via cigarette smoking", "citedTitle": "The Reinforcing Effects of Nicotine in Humans and Nonhuman Primates: A Review of Intravenous Self-Administration Evidence and Future Directions for Research."}

This gradient presents an opportunity to investigate changes in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that accompany growth under light and dark conditions, as done previously for plastid DNA. Maize mtDNA was analyzed by DAPI-DNA staining of individual mitochondria, gel electrophoresis/blot hybridization, and real-time qPCR. Both the amount and integrity of the mtDNA were found to decline with development. There was a 20-fold decline in mtDNA copy number per cell from the embryo to the light-grown leaf blade. The amount of DNA per mitochondrial particle was greater in dark-grown leaf blade (24 copies, on average) than in the light (2 copies), with some mitochondria lacking any detectable DNA. Three factors that influence the demise of mtDNA during development are considered: (1) the decision to either repair or degrade mtDNA molecules that are damaged by the reactive oxygen species produced as byproducts of respiration; (2) the generation of ATP by photophosphorylation in chloroplasts, reducing the need for respiratory-competent mitochondria; and (3) the shift in mitochondrial function from energy-generating respiration to photorespiration during the transition from non-green to green tissue.", "citedAbstract": "In maize (Zea mays L.), chloroplast development progresses from the basal meristem to the mature leaf tip, and light is required for maturation to photosynthetic competence. During chloroplast greening, it was found that chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) is extensively degraded, falling to undetectable levels in many individual chloroplasts for three maize cultivars, as well as Zea mexicana (the ancestor of cultivated maize) and the perennial species Zea diploperennis. In dark-grown maize seedlings, the proplastid-to-etioplast transition is characterized by plastid enlargement, cpDNA replication, and the retention of high levels of cpDNA. When dark-grown seedlings are transferred to white light, the DNA content per plastid increases slightly during the first 4 h of illumination and then declines rapidly to a minimum at 24 h during the etioplast-to-chloroplast transition. Plastid autofluorescence (from chlorophyll) continues to increase as cpDNA declines, whereas plastid size remains constant. It is concluded that the increase in cpDNA that accompanies plastid enlargement is a consequence of cell and leaf growth, rather than illumination, whereas light stimulates photosynthetic capacity and cpDNA instability. When cpDNA from total tissue was monitored by blot hybridization and real-time quantitative PCR, no decline following transfer from dark to light was observed. The lack of agreement between DNA per plastid and cpDNA per cell may be attributed to nupts (nuclear sequences of plastid origin).", "citingTitle": "The amount and integrity of mtDNA in maize decline with development", "citedTitle": "Independent effects of leaf growth and light on the development of the plastid and its DNA content in Zea species."}

In the current work, the first molecular data, in particular complete ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) on A. tenuicollis from Niushan Lake, Wuhan, China, are provided. In order to evaluate molecular interrelationships within Atractolytocestus, the data on A. tenuicollis were compared with relevant data on two other congeners, Atractolytocestus huronensis and Atractolytocestus sagittatus. Divergent intragenomic copies (ITS2 paralogues) were detected in the ITS2 ribosomal spacer of A. tenuicollis; the same phenomenon has previously been observed also in two other congeners. ITS2 structure of A. tenuicollis was very similar to that of A. huronensis from Slovakia, USA and UK; overall pairwise sequence identity was 91.7\u201395.2\u00a0%. On the other hand, values of sequence identity between A. tenuicollis and A. sagittatus were lower, 69.7\u201370.9\u00a0%.

These challenges may be further compounded in mixed-species aggregations, where signals from different species overlap and mate-searching females may perceive heterospecific signals in more attractive relative timing positions. I conducted playback experiments with green treefrogs (Hyla cinerea) to test the effects of cross-species call interference on sexual communication and found that the sexes responded differently to conspecific and heterospecific calls. Females differentiated between call types and preferentially approached the conspecific call, indicating that they were not negatively affected by cross-species call interference. By contrast, males did not differentiate between conspecific and heterospecific calls irrespective of the presented call type and males avoided call overlap and called shortly after the offset of any interfering call. I suggest that the observed sex difference is a function of the time frames that the individual has to evaluate the call before initiating a behavioral response. Slower behavioral responses, like phonotaxis that allows for a repeated sampling of a call during approach, may facilitate finer discrimination. Fast behavioral responses, like timing one\u2019s call relative to the call of a rival, may limit processing and result in higher permissiveness. As a result, similar call timing behavior in response to conspecific and heterospecific signals may be an artifact of strong selection for fast and precise call timing in the conspecific context and may essentially trap males into wasting time and energy interacting with heterospecifics.", "citedAbstract": "In many species, males advertise to both male and female audiences. Given the asymmetry in fitness costs of recognition errors in response to mating signals for the sexes, usually higher for females than males, males are expected to be more permissive than females in their responses to signals. Few studies, however, have investigated such differences and there is no consensus on which sex is more permissive to signal variation. We examined the evoked vocal responses of male tungara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus, to 14 species of heterospecific and ancestral male mating calls to evaluate the influence of call similarity and phylogenetic distance on their responses. We also compared male calling responses to female phonotactic responses to examine the propensity of response errors between the sexes. Recognition errors were higher for males than females, as predicted by the different costs associated with recognition errors for each sex. Males responded to the calls of most species with mating calls, and produced aggressive calls in response to two other heterospecific/ancestral calls. The responses of males were explained by phylogenetic distance but not by overall call similarity. Similarly, females were more likely to show phonotaxis to calls of species and ancestors that were more closely related. Therefore, evolutionary history has left a perceptual footprint on the brain of both sexes but the details seem to differ. We discuss proximate reasons underlying sexual differences in receiver permissiveness in tungara frogs and potential factors leading to their evolution.", "citingTitle": "Sexual differences in responses to cross-species call interference in the green treefrog (Hyla cinerea)", "citedTitle": "Sex differences in response to nonconspecific advertisement calls: receiver permissiveness in male and female t\u00fangara frogs"}

Refractive errors were measured by photorefractometry and cycloautorefraction. Strabismus was checked using cover test. Direct ophthalmoscopy was used to assess the anterior segment, lens opacities, red reflex and fundus. Functional amblyopia was defined as best corrected visual acuity \u226420/40 in one or both eyes with no anatomical problems. Results: Amblyopia was present in 2.3% (95% CI: 1.8% to 2.9%) of participants with no difference between the genders.

Metabolic reactions involving H(2) and CH(4), particularly hydrogen oxidation, methanotrophy, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis, represent the predominant sources of chemical energy during fluid mixing. Owing to chemical gradients that develop from fluid mixing, aerobic metabolisms are likely to predominate in low-temperature environments (<20-30 degrees C), while anaerobes will dominate higher-temperature environments. Overall, aerobic metabolic reactions can supply up to approximately 7 kJ of energy per kilogram of hydrothermal fluid, while anaerobic metabolic reactions can supply about 1 kJ, which is sufficient to support a maximum of approximately 120 mg (dry weight) of primary biomass production by aerobic organisms and approximately 20-30 mg biomass by anaerobes.

To promote commensalism in animals and disease in humans, Campylobacter jejuni produces a flagellar organelle for motility. In addition to tight transcriptional regulation of flagellar genes, C.\u2003jejuni also controls flagellar biosynthesis by phase variation. In this study, an unusual phase\u2010variable mechanism controlling production of FlgR, the response regulator of the FlgSR two\u2010component system required for transcription of \u03c354\u2010dependent flagellar genes, is identified. Phase variation of FlgR production is due to loss or gain of a nucleotide in homopolymeric adenine or thymine tracts within flgR. This mechanism occurs during commensalism in poultry to alter the colonization capacity of C.\u2003jejuni, presumably by influencing the motility phenotype of the bacterium. These findings provide more understanding into the genetic and colonization strategies C.\u2003jejuni employs to achieve commensalism in a natural host. Second, due to the richness of the C.\u2003jejuni genome in adenine or thymine residues and the apparent lack of the normal set of mismatch repair enzymes, the results from this study may suggest that the C.\u2003jejuni genome is more unstable and variable than previously realized. Furthermore, phase variation of flagellar motility by targeting flgR may be a phenomenon specific to C.\u2003jejuni that is absent in other Campylobacter species and contribute to reasons why C.\u2003jejuni is more frequently found as a commensal organism in poultry and as the cause of disease in humans.", "citedAbstract": "Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans in developed countries throughout the world.

We have examined the changes in cocontraction that follow dynamics learning in tasks that are thought to involve finely sculpted feedforward adjustments to motor commands. We find that, even following substantial training, cocontraction varies in a systematic way that depends on both movement direction and the strength of the external load. The proportion of total activity that is due to cocontraction nevertheless remains remarkably constant. Moreover, long after indices of motor learning and electromyographic measures have reached asymptotic levels, cocontraction still accounts for a significant proportion of total muscle activity in all phases of movement and in all load conditions.

The goal of this study was to test for a possible relationship between cocontraction and movement accuracy in multi-joint limb movements. The electromyographic activity of seven single- and double-joint shoulder and elbow muscles was recorded using surface electrodes while subjects performed a pointing task in a horizontal plane to targets that varied randomly in size. Movement speed was controlled by providing subjects with feedback on a trial-to-trial basis. Measures of cocontraction were estimated both during movement and during a 200-ms window immediately following movement end. We observed an inverse relationship between target size and cocontraction: as target size was reduced, cocontraction activity increased. In addition, trajectory variability decreased and endpoint accuracy improved. This suggests that, although energetically expensive, cocontraction may be a strategy used by the motor system to facilitate multi-joint arm movement accuracy.

To gain insight into the cause of these major evolutionary events, we have retraced the history of cyt c loci among primates. For testis cyt c, all primate sequences examined carry the same nonsense mutation, which suggests that silencing occurred before the primates diversified. For somatic cyt c, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses yielded the same tree topology. The evolutionary analyses show that a fast accumulation of non-synonymous mutations (suggesting positive selection) occurred specifically on the anthropoid lineage root and then continued in parallel on the early catarrhini and platyrrhini stems. Analysis of evolutionary changes using the 3D structure suggests they are focused on the respiratory chain rather than on apoptosis or other cyt c functions. In agreement with previous biochemical studies, our results suggest that silencing of the cyt c testis isoform could be linked with the decrease of primate reproduction rate. Finally, the evolution of cyt c in the two sister anthropoid groups leads us to propose that somatic cyt c evolution may be related both to COX evolution and to the convergent brain and body mass enlargement in these two anthropoid clades.", "citedAbstract": "Rates of molecular evolution vary over time and, hence, among lineages.

Therefore, methods for estimation of divergence times that incorporate rate variation are attractive.

New parameterization more effectively captures the phylogenetic structure of rate evolution on a tree. Fossil information and other evidence can now be included in Bayesian analyses in the form of constraints on divergence times.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the kinematics of one-on-one defensive movements in soccer competitions, and determine the relationships between lower limb kinematics and the center of mass translation during cutting actions. Six defensive scenes in which a player was responding to an offender\u2019s dribble attack were selected for analysis. To reconstruct the three-dimensional kinematics of the players, we used a photogrammetric model-based image-matching technique. The hip and knee kinematics were calculated from the matched skeleton model. In addition, the center of mass height was expressed as a ratio of each participant\u2019s body height. The relationships between the center of mass height and the kinematics were determined by the Pearson\u2019s product-moment correlation coefficient. The normalized center of mass height at initial contact was correlated with the vertical center of mass displacement (r = 0.832, p = 0.040) and hip flexion angle at initial contact (r = \u22120.823, p = 0.044). This suggests that the lower center of mass at initial contact is an important factor to reduce the downwards vertical center of mass translation during defensive cutting actions, and that this is executed primarily through hip flexion. It is therefore recommended that players land with an adequately flexed hip at initial contact during one-on-one cutting actions to minimize the vertical center of mass excursion.", "citedAbstract": "In many situations, e.g. sports injuries, three-dimensional kinematics cannot be obtained with traditional lab methods. However, if methods for reconstructing motion patterns from video sequences were available, our understanding of injury mechanisms could be improved. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new model-based image-matching technique for human motion reconstruction from one or more uncalibrated video sequences, using traditional motion analysis as a gold standard. A laboratory trial was conducted with one test subject performing jogging and side step cutting, while being filmed with three ordinary video cameras. This provided three single camera matchings, three double camera matchings and one triple camera matching for each of the motions. The test subject wore 33 reflective skin markers and was filmed with a seven-camera, 240 Hz motion analysis system. Root mean square (RMS) hip and knee flexion/extension angle differences were less than 12 degrees for all the matchings. Estimates for ad-/abduction (<15 degrees) and internal/external rotation (<16 degrees) were less precise. RMS velocity differences up to 0.62 m/s were found for the single camera matchings, but for the triple camera matching the RMS differences were less than 0.13 m/s for each direction. In conclusion, a new model-based image-matching technique has been developed, that can be used to estimate temporal joint angle histories, velocities and accelerations from uncalibrated video recordings. The kinematic estimates, in particular for center of mass velocity and acceleration, are clearly better when two or more camera views are available. This method can potentially be used to arrive at more precise descriptions of the mechanisms of sports injuries than what has been possible without elaborate methods for three-dimensional reconstruction from uncalibrated video sequences, e.g. for knee injuries.", "citingTitle": "Biomechanical Analysis of Defensive Cutting Actions During Game Situations: Six Cases in Collegiate Soccer Competitions", "citedTitle": "A model-based image-matching technique for three-dimensional reconstruction of human motion from uncalibrated video sequences."}

Particles impacting turbine blades at velocities up to about 300 m=s produce small indentation craters which can become sites for fatigue crack initiation, severely limiting the lifetime of the blade. A framework for analyzing FOD and its e5ect on fatigue cracking is established in this paper. Finite element analysis is used to determine the residual stresses and geometric stress concentration resulting from FOD. The roles of material rate sensitivity and inertia are delineated. The most important non-dimensional parameters governing impact indents are identi7ed, signi7cantly reducing the set of independent parameters. The second step in the analysis focuses on the potency of cracks emerging from critical locations at the indents. The results have been used to address the question: When and to what extent do the residual stresses and stress concentration caused by FOD reduce the critical crack size associated with threshold fatigue crack growth? For deep indents, it is found that elastic stress concentration is the dominant factor in reducing critical crack threshold when the applied cyclic load ratio, R, is large, otherwise the residual stresses are also important. Comparisons with a set of experiments conducted in parallel with the theory show that the numerical approach can account for various phenomena observed in practice. ? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Experimentally, FOD is simulated by firing 1and 3.2 mm diameter steel spheres onto the flat specimen surface of tensile fatigue specimens at velocities of 200 and 300 m/s. Such damage was found to markedly reduce the fatigue strength of the alloy, primarily due to four factors: stress concentration, microcrack formation, impact-induced plasticity and tensile residual stresses associated with the impact damage. Two groups of fatigue failures could be identified. The first group initiated directly at the impact site, and can be readily described through the use of a fatigue-crack growth threshold concept. Specifically, a Kitagawa\u2013Takahashi approach is presented where the limiting threshold conditions are defined by the stress-concentration corrected smooth-bar fatigue limit (at microstructurally small crack sizes) and a \u2018\u2018worst-case\u2019\u2019 fatigue-crack growth threshold (at larger crack sizes). The second group of failures was caused by fatigue cracks that initiated at locations far from the impact site in regions of high tensile residual stresses, the magnitude of which was computed numerically and measured experimentally using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Specifically, these failures could be rationalized due to the superposition of the residual stresses on the farfield applied mean stress, leading to a locally elevated load ratio (ratio of minimum to maximum loads). The effects of residual stress, stress concentration, and microstructurally small cracks are combined in a modified Kitagawa\u2013 Takahashi approach to provide a mechanistic basis for evaluating the detrimental effect of FOD on HCF failures in Ti\u2013 6Al\u20134V blade alloys. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In experiment 3, leg blood flow was assessed during constant-force exercise at two intensities (30 and 70% F(max)) and two tilt angles (0 and 67 degrees ) in six subjects. Strength was not affected (P > 0.05) by tilt angle. Time to failure during the graded test was significantly higher at 47 degrees (25.9 +/- 2.0 min) and 90 degrees (25.1 +/- 3.0 min) than 0 degrees (22.2 +/- 2.6 min).

When graded or constant-force exercise was performed with arterial flow to the leg eliminated, there were no differences in exercise time between the horizontal and an inclined position. During nonischemic exercise, leg blood flow was significantly higher during exercise in the inclined position. These results demonstrate that head-up tilt improves endurance of the plantar flexors, that this effect occurs in the absence of an effect on strength, and that it depends on an intact peripheral circulation.

In recent years, deep neural network based models have been developed to address such needs and they have made significant progress in relation identification.MethodsWe propose a dependency-based deep neural network model for DDI extraction. By introducing the dependency-based technique to a bi-directional long short term memory network (Bi-LSTM), we build three channels, namely, Linear channel, DFS channel and BFS channel. All of these channels are constructed with three network layers, including embedding layer, LSTM layer and max pooling layer from bottom up. In the embedding layer, we extract two types of features, one is distance-based feature and another is dependency-based feature. In the LSTM layer, a Bi-LSTM is instituted in each channel to better capture relation information. Then max pooling is used to get optimal features from the entire encoding sequential data. At last, we concatenate the outputs of all channels and then link it to the softmax layer for relation identification.ResultsTo the best of our knowledge, our model achieves new state-of-the-art performance with the F-score of 72.0% on the DDIExtraction 2013 corpus.

In order to identify each original long pattern being divided, a two-stage sequential matching scheme is proposed for the successive matches with subpatterns.

Changes in cardiac NAD(P)H caused similar changes at 340 and 380 nm excitation, but those at 340 nm were of greater magnitude. Isolated cardiac mitochondria exhibited essentially identical optical properties during changes in NAD(P)H content induced by changes in substrate availability and by NAD(H) oxidation/reduction caused by coupled phosphorylation of ADP.

Use of this ratio in the perfused heart avoids the artifacts caused by cardiac motion and tissue stretch. Removal of motion artifacts with an excitation ratio could only be accomplished if the measurements at 340 and 380 nm were estimated at the same point in the cardiac cycle. A method of cardiac waveform reconstruction and signal averaging is described to obtain these data from sequential measurements.

The idea behind our method is that the volume of the myocardium is close to being constant during a cardiac cycle and our model uses this coupling as an important constraint. We employ two surfaces, each driven by the image-derived information that takes into account ultrasound physics by modeling the speckle statistics using the Nakagami distribution while maintaining the coupling. By simultaneously evolving two surfaces, the final segmentation of the myocardium is thus achieved. Results from 80 sets of synthetic data and 286 sets of real canine data were evaluated against the ground truth and against outlines from three independent observers, respectively. We show that results obtained with our incompressibility constraint were more accurate than those obtained without constraint or with a wall thickness constraint, and were comparable to those from manual segmentation.", "citedAbstract": "This study investigated the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) for image segmentation and spatial temporal contour linking for the detection of endocardial contours on echocardiographic images. Using a backpropagation network, the system was trained with 279 sample regions obtained from eight training images to segment images into either tissue or blood pool region. The ANN system was then applied to parasternal short axis images of 38 patients. Spatial temporal contour linking was performed on the segmented images to extract endocardial boarders. Left ventricular areas (end-systolic and end-diastolic) determined with the automated system were calculated and compared to results obtained by manual contour tracing performed by two independent investigators. In addition, ejection fractions (EF) were derived using the area-length method and compared with radionuclide ventriculography. Image quality was classified as good in 12 (32%), moderate in 13 (34%) and poor in 13 (34%) patients. The ANN system provided estimates of end-diastolic and end-systolic areas in 36 (89%) of echocardiograms, which correlated well with those obtained by manual tracing (R = 0.99, SEE = 1.44). A good agreement was also found for the comparison of EF between the ANN system and Tc-radionuclide ventriculography (RNV, R = 0.93, SEE = 6.36). The ANN system also performed well in the subset of patients with poor image quality. Endocardial contour detection using artificial neural networks and spatial temporal contour linking allows accurate calculations of ventricular areas from transthoracic echocardiograms and performs well even in images with poor quality. This system could greatly enhance the feasibility, accuracy and reproducibility of calculating cardiac areas to derive left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions.", "citingTitle": "A coupled deformable model for tracking myocardial borders from real-time echocardiography using an incompressibility constraint", "citedTitle": "Artificial neural networks and spatial temporal contour linking for automated endocardial contour detection on echocardiograms: a novel approach to determine left ventricular contractile function."}

A highly conserved 5\u2032 noncoding exon, exon 1c, is present in vertebrates from fish to mammals and appears to define the ancestral promoter region. The distance from exon 1c to the first coding exon increased tenfold during vertebrate evolution, largely by insertion of repetitive elements. The mammalian gene acquired three novel, mutually exclusive noncoding exons that are not represented in the lower vertebrates. Within the shared exon 1c, we identified four short sequence elements of 10-20 bp with an unusually high level of evolutionary conservation. The conserved elements are most similar to consensus sites for the transcription factors Pou6f1/Brn5, YY1, and REST/NRSF. Introduction of mutations into the predicted Pou6f1 and REST sites reduced promoter activity in transfected neuronal cells.

Their three genomes can have different modes of transmission and will hence experience varying levels of gene flow. We have compiled studies of genetic structure based on chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear markers in seed plants. Based on a data set of 183 species belonging to 103 genera and 52 families, we show that the precision of estimates of genetic differentiation (GST) used to infer gene flow is mostly constrained by the sampling of populations. Mode of inheritance appears to have a major effect on GST. Maternally inherited genomes experience considerably more subdivision (median value of 0.67) than paternally or biparentally inherited genomes (\u223c0.10). GST at cpDNA and mtDNA markers covary narrowly when both genomes are maternally inherited, whereas GST at paternally and biparentally inherited markers also covary positively but more loosely and GST at maternally inherited markers are largely independent of values based on nuclear markers. A model\u2010based gross estimate suggests that, at the rangewide scale, historical levels of pollen flow are generally at least an order of magnitude larger than levels of seed flow (median of the pollen\u2010to\u2010seed migration ratio: 17) and that pollen and seed gene flow vary independently across species.

Do ratings of aptness actually reflect the aptness of the metaphors? Are ratings of aptness measuring something different from ratings of familiarity? With two experiments and an analysis of existing datasets, we argue that ratings of metaphoric sentences are confounded by how easily people are able to understand the sentences (processing fluency).

Because of its complex nature, each identified form of AF requires specialized treatment. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the bases of these arrhythmias is essential for therapeutic development. A variety of experimental studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms of AF are performed using primary cultures of neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes (NRAMs). Previously, we have shown that the distinct advantage of NRAM cultures is that they allow standardized, systematic, robust re-entry induction in the presence of a constitutively-active acetylcholine-mediated K+ current (IKACh-c). Experimental studies dedicated to mechanistic explorations of AF, using these cultures, often use computer models for detailed electrophysiological investigations. However, currently, no mathematical model for NRAMs is available.

The descriptions of the ionic currents were based on patch-clamp data obtained from neonatal rats. Our monolayer model closely mimics the action potential duration (APD) restitution and conduction velocity (CV) restitution curves presented in our previous in vitro studies.

Voltage clamp studies of the excitatory sodium current, INa, were carried out in rabbit cardiac Purkinje fibres using th two\u2010micro\u2010electrode technique. Previous work has shown the rabbit Purkinje fibre to have relatively simple morphology (Sommer & Johnson, 1968) and electrical structure (Colatsky & Tsien, 1979a) compared to other cardiac preparations. 2. Non\u2010uniformities in membrane potential were kept small by reducing the size of INa to less than 50 microA/cm2 of total membrane surface area through prepulse inactivation or removal of external sodium, Nao. Temporal resolution was improved by cooling to 10\u201026 degrees C. These adjustments did not greatly alter the measured properties of the sodium channel. 3. Under these conditions, sodium currents were recorded satisfying a number of criteria for adequate voltage control. Direct measurement of longitudinal non\u2010uniformity using a second voltage electrode showed only small deviations at the time of peak current. 4. The properties of the sodium channel were examined using conventional protocols. Both peak sodium permeability, PNa, and steady\u2010state sodium inactivation, h infinity, showed a sigmoidal dependence on membrane potential. PNa rose steeply with small depolarizations, increasing roughly e\u2010fold per 3.2 mV, and reaching half\u2010maximal activation at \u201030 +/\u2010 2 mV. The h infinity \u2010V curve had a midpoint of \u201074.9 +/\u2010 2 mV and a reciprocal slope of 4.56 +/\u2010 0.13 mV at temperatures of 10\u201019.5 degrees C, and showed a dependence on temperature, shifting to more negative potentials with cooling (approximately 3 mV/10 degrees C). Recovery of INa from inactivation in double pulse experiments followed a single exponential time course with time constants of 108\u2010200 msec at 19 degrees C for holding potentials near \u201080 mV. No attempt was made to describe the activation kinetics because of uncertainties about the early time course of the current. 5. These data predict a maximum duration for INa of less than 1\u20102 msec and a maximum peak current density of about 500 microA/cm2 under physiological conditions, i.e. 37 degrees C and 150 mM\u2010Nao. This current magnitude is sufficient to discharge the membrane capacitance at rates comparable to those measured experimentally (311 +/\u2010 27 V/sec, Colatsky & Tsien, 1979a). 6. The limitations of the method are discussed. The major problem is the longitudinal cable delay which limits the speed of voltage control. This makes it difficult to separate the activation of INa from the decay of the capacity transient for potentials positive to \u201015 mV. 7. It is concluded that the approach described is valid for measurements of sodium currents in the potential range where action potentials are initiated, making it possible to study cardiac sodium channels in an adult mammalian preparation which is free of enzymatic treatment.", "citingTitle": "A Mathematical Model of Neonatal Rat Atrial Monolayers with Constitutively Active Acetylcholine-Mediated K+ Current", "citedTitle": "Voltage clamp measurements of sodium channel properties in rabbit cardiac Purkinje fibres."}

We have designed a processing chain based on background segmentation, selection keypoints with an adaptive scale, description with OpponentSift and learning of each species by a binary linear Support Vector Machines classifier.\n Our algorithm has been evaluated in the context of our participation to the Fish task of the LifeCLEF2014 challenge. Compared to the baseline designed by the LifeCLEF challenge organizers, our approach reaches a better precision but a worse recall. Our performances in terms of species recognition (based only on the correctly detected bounding boxes) is comparable to the baseline, but our bounding boxes are often too large and our score is so penalized. Our results are thus really encouraging.", "citingTitle": "Fine-grained object recognition in underwater visual data", "citedTitle": "Fish Species Recognition from Video using SVM Classifier"}

Forcing cry expression in the larval DN2s gave them a normal phase of PER cycling, indicating that their unique antiphase rhythm is related to their lack of cry expression. We were able to directly monitor CRY protein in Drosophila brains in situ. It appeared highly unstable in the light, whereas in the dark, it accumulated in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, including some neuritic projections. We also show that dorsal PER-expressing brain neurons, the adult DN1s, are the only brain neurons to coexpress the CRY protein and the photoreceptor differentiation factor GLASS. Studies of various visual system mutants and their combination with the cryb mutation indicated that the adult DN1s contribute significantly to the light sensitivity of the clock controlling activity rhythms, and that this contribution depends on CRY. Moreover, all CRY-independent light inputs into this central behavioral clock were found to require the visual system. Finally, we show that the photoreceptive DN1 neurons do not behave as autonomous oscillators, because their PER oscillations in constant darkness rapidly damp out in the absence of pigment-dispersing-factor signaling from the ventral lateral neurons.", "citingTitle": "PDF Receptor Signaling in Drosophila Contributes to Both Circadian and Geotactic Behaviors", "citedTitle": "Novel Features of Cryptochrome-Mediated Photoreception in the Brain Circadian Clock of Drosophila"}

Bifidobacteria are saccharolytic microorganisms, but their ability to use different carbohydrates varies among strains. In this study, we investigate the utilization of three prebiotic substrates (two different short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides [scFOS] and inulin) by strains of Bifidobacterium, in order to determine the synbiotic potential of the different probiotic/prebiotic combinations.

Specifically, we utilized wavelet transform and stage segmentation algorithms using VTC time series data set as an input. The VTC time series was time-locked with multichannel (n\u00a0=\u00a064) EEG signals to examine its underlying neural substrates. To identify the focal sources of neural substrates of VTC, a two-step approach was designed combining the independent component analysis (ICA) and low-resolution tomography (LORETA) of multichannel EEG. There were two major findings: (1) a significant increase of VTC minimal values (along with enhanced variability of VTC) was observed during the transition-to-instability stage with progression to ultimate loss of balance and falling; and (2) this VTC dynamics was associated with pronounced modulation of EEG predominantly within theta, alpha and gamma frequency bands. The sources of this EEG modulation were identified at the cingulate cortex (ACC) and the junction of precuneus and parietal lobe, as well as at the occipital cortex.

The distribution of the radial displacement of the center of pressure showed relatively equal frequency over spatial location with no central tendency. The virtual time-to-contact with the stability boundary decreased as platform surface support became more compliant. Furthermore, the distribution of virtual time over the effective scaling range was a power law with a larger exponent in the more unstable no vision and increasing surface foam conditions.

However, there lacks a systematical analytic work on modeling the redundancy- based routing schemes for delay tolerant networks. This mo- tivates us to develop a unified model to analyze the various redundancy-based routing schemes. In this paper, we model the message delivering process in DTNs as a continuous time Markov random process with absorbing state. With this model, we have derived the probability distribution functions of the message delivery delay for different routing schemes, including direct transmission routing, source forward, and binary forward schemes.

To deal with such networks researchers have suggested to use flooding-based routing schemes.

This incurs in an additional RBPP accumulation stage for the MBE multiplier. In this paper, a new RB modified partial product generator (RBMPPG) is proposed; it removes the extra ECW and hence, it saves one RBPP accumulation stage. Therefore, the proposed RBMPPG generates fewer partial product rows than a conventional RB MBE multiplier. Simulation results show that the proposed RBMPPG based designs significantly improve the area and power consumption when the word length of each operand in the multiplier is at least 32 bits; these reductions over previous NB multiplier designs incur in a modest delay increase (approximately 5 percent).

Inhalation toxicokinetics of p-dichlorobenzene (p-DCB) in humans was evaluated, and the amounts of daily absorption and internal accumulation were estimated in order to obtain fundamental data for the risk assessment of chronic low-level exposure in the general population. Seven male subjects continuously inhaled about 2.5\u00a0ppm of p-DCB vapor for 1\u00a0h, and the concentration-time courses of p-DCB in their exhaled air and serum and of urinary 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-DCP), a major metabolite of p-DCB, were examined. The toxicokinetics of p-DCB was evaluated on the basis of the time courses using a linear two-compartment model. The amounts of p-DCB absorbed daily and the internal accumulation in chronic low-level exposure were extrapolated using the estimated toxicokinetic parameters. p-DCB was transferred from inhaled air to the body with a constant high absorption rate during exposure. The major route for elimination from the body was urinary excretion followed by metabolism, not exhalation. However, during 9\u201311\u00a0h after the start of exposure, the fraction of p-DCB excreted in urine was only 5\u201316% of the amount absorbed. Furthermore, most of the absorbed p-DCB seemed to be distributed rapidly to the tissues, such as fat, according to toxicokinetic analysis. Consequently, p-DCB seems to require a long time to be completely eliminated from the body. The amounts of daily absorption and internal accumulation were extrapolated to average 0.27\u00a0mg/day and 2.9\u00a0mg, respectively, in the subjects exposed chronically to 1\u00a0ppb of p-DCB.

Using matrix Factorization (MF) - the most widely used model in recommendation - as a demonstration, we show that optimizing it with BPR leads to a recommender model that is not robust. In particular, we find that the resultant model is highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on its model parameters, which implies the possibly large error in generalization. To enhance the robustness of a recommender model and thus improve its generalization performance, we propose a new optimization framework, namely Adversarial Personalized Ranking (APR). In short, our APR enhances the pairwise ranking method BPR by performing adversarial training. It can be interpreted as playing a minimax game, where the minimization of the BPR objective function meanwhile defends an adversary, which adds adversarial perturbations on model parameters to maximize the BPR objective function. To illustrate how it works, we implement APR on MF by adding adversarial perturbations on the embedding vectors of users and items. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of APR - by optimizing MF with APR, it outperforms BPR with a relative improvement of 11.2% on average and achieves state-of-the-art performance for item recommendation.

Variable demographic rates can manifest themselves between habitat types in the form of source\u2013sink dynamics where populations in sink habitats would not exist without the addition of migrants from source habitats. Aims. Arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii pleisus (Osgood, 1900)) occupy a large geographic area in northern Canada and live in a variety of habitat types, including boreal forest, low-elevation meadows and alpine meadows, providing an opportunity to investigate the possible existence of source\u2013sink dynamics. Methods. We hypothesised that arctic ground squirrels in the south-western Yukon exhibit demographic characteristics indicative of source\u2013sink dynamics. Boreal forest habitat could be a sink in spite of previous high squirrel densities, whereas meadows could be a source. We investigated this by mark\u2013recapture live-trapping and radio-telemetry. Key Results. In the boreal forest in the Kluane region, we found reduced recruitment, reduced population growth rates (\u03bb), and reduced survivorship for radio-collared individuals that moved from low-elevation meadows into the boreal forest. There was no evidence from radio-collared juveniles of dispersal from high-density ground squirrel populations in alpine meadows down into boreal forest. Conclusions. Boreal forest is a sink habitat for arctic ground squirrels. Source\u2013sink dynamics observed between low-elevation meadow and boreal forest habitats appear to result from increased predation pressure in the boreal forest. The result has been a near extirpation of boreal forest arctic ground squirrels in the Kluane region since 1998. Implications. Because the source areas of low-elevation meadows occupy only 7\u20139% of the lowland habitat, recolonisation of boreal forest sites has been very slow. Whereas alpine populations remain high in 2011, boreal forest populations remain near zero. Alpine populations do not appear to be a source for the boreal forest.", "citedAbstract": "Nous avons etudie les sousliks arctiques (Urocitellus parryii plesius (Osgood, 1900); anterieurement Spermophilus parryii plesius Osgood, 1900) dans trois types d'habitat distincts (la foret boreale, les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines) dans la region de Kluane dans le sud-ouest du territoire du Yukon, Canada, de 2008 a 2010, afin de determiner si les populations de ces differents habitats presentaient des repartitions et des abondances specifiques aux habitats.

Profiling of CpG island methylation indicates that some genes are more frequently methylated than others, and that each tumor type is associated with a unique set of methylated genes. However, little is known about why certain genes succumb to this aberrant event. To address this question, we used Restriction Landmark Genome Scanning to analyze the susceptibility of 1,749 unselected CpG islands to de novo methylation driven by overexpression of DNA cytosine-5-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). We found that although the overall incidence of CpG island methylation was increased in cells overexpressing DNMT1, not all loci were equally affected. The majority of CpG islands (69.9%) were resistant to de novo methylation, regardless of DNMT1 overexpression. In contrast, we identified a subset of methylation-prone CpG islands (3.8%) that were consistently hypermethylated in multiple DNMT1 overexpressing clones. Methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands were not significantly different with respect to size, C+G content, CpG frequency, chromosomal location, or promoter association. We used DNA pattern recognition and supervised learning techniques to derive a classification function based on the frequency of seven novel sequence patterns that was capable of discriminating methylation-prone from methylation-resistant CpG islands with 82% accuracy. The data indicate that CpG islands differ in their intrinsic susceptibility to de novo methylation, and suggest that the propensity for a CpG island to become aberrantly methylated can be predicted based on its sequence context.", "citingTitle": "Identification of putative targets of DNA (cytosine-5) methylation-mediated transcriptional silencing using a novel conditionally active form of DNA methyltransferase 3a", "citedTitle": "Predicting aberrant CpG island methylation"}

Subjects received tests of cognition and daily function at baseline and at multiple subsequent time points during their participation in a variety of research protocols. Cognition was measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog). Functional performance was assessed using the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living questionnaire (IADL) as well as the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living inventory (ADCS-ADL). Subjects were also characterized for the frequency and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). There was a significant effect of val66met genotype on educational attainment (F = 7.42, df = 2, 329, P = .00070), with met homozygotes having significantly fewer years of education than both the val/met and val/val groups. No association was observed between any BDNF polymorphism and measures of cognitive or functional decline. The C270T-T allele was associated with a higher prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (Z = -2.11, N = 241, p = .035) and specifically with the presence of hallucinations (OR = 3.25, 95% CI = [1.22-8.62], p = .018). In summary, the val66met polymorphism appears to be associated with lower premorbid educational attainment in AD patients.

Each patient had multiple other failed treatment modalities, including partial pancreatic resection (n=6). They were offered ITNP after a successful intraspinal opioid trial. Etiologies of CP included idiopathy (n=3), cystic fibrosis (n=2), alcohol (n=2), and pancreas divisum (n=6).RESULTS:The median duration of severe, intractable pain prior to ITNP was 6 years (2\u201322 years). The median follow-up time after ITNP was 29 months (range, 7\u201394 months). The ITNP was in situ for a mean duration of 29 months (range, 0.5\u201394 months). Seven patients had pump exchange or removal for various reasons; improvement of pain at month 53 (n=1), meningitis (n=1), meningitis with subsequent replacement (n=1), pump failure at month 31, 68, 79, and 84 (n=4). There were no deaths. The mean pain score prior to implantation (score=8.3, s.d.=0.9) was significantly higher than 1 year after (score=2.7, s.d.=1.9) (P<0.01) and last follow-up (score=0.75, s.d.=2.1) (P<0.01). The median oral narcotic dose before and 1 year after ITNP were morphine sulfate equivalents 337.5\u2009mg per day (range, 67.5\u20131,320) and 40\u2009mg per day (range, 0\u20131,680), respectively (P<0.01). Two patients were considered failures, as they still require a high dosage of both oral and intrathecal medications to control their pain, despite significant pain-score improvement. One patient who was excluded due to meningitis was also considered a failure. Therefore, the overall success rate of ITNP based on an intention-to-treat analysis was 76.9% (10/13). The major complications of ITNP were central nervous system infection requiring pump removal (n=1), cerebrospinal fluid leak requiring laminectomy (n=1), and perispinal abscess with bacterial meningitis requiring pump removal (n=1).CONCLUSIONS:This study shows the many risks and benefits of ITNP.

With the highest external load and trunk flexion, the electrical activity of back muscles increased significantly in both groups. With increasing load, the activation of Rectus abdominis muscle in patients with CLBP and the activation of Rectus abdominis and Internal oblique muscles were increased significantly in healthy subjects.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHigher activation of global and lower activation of local abdominal muscles in patients with CLBP may represent that pain changes neuromuscular control systems. The increased activity of extensor muscles during trunk flexion is probably needed for stability and controlling of flexion.", "citedAbstract": "Stability of the lumbar spine is an important factor in determining spinal response to sudden loading. Using two different methods, this study evaluated how various trunk load magnitudes and directions affect lumbar spine stability. The first method was a quick release procedure in which effective trunk stiffness and stability were calculated from trunk kinematic response to a resisted-force release. The second method combined trunk muscle EMG data with a biomechanical model to calculate lumbar spine stability. Twelve subjects were tested in trunk flexion, extension, and lateral bending under nine permutations of vertical and horizontal trunk loading. The vertical load values were set at 0, 20, and 40% of the subject's body weight (BW). The horizontal loads were 0, 10, and 20% of BW. Effective spine stability as obtained from quick release experimentation increased significantly (p<0.01) with increased vertical and horizontal loading. It ranged from 785 (S.D.=580) Nm/rad under no-load conditions to 2200 (S.D.=1015) Nm/rad when the maximum horizontal and vertical loads were applied to the trunk simultaneously. Stability of the lumbar spine achieved prior to force release and estimated from the biomechanical model explained approximately 50% of variance in the effective spine stability obtained from quick release trials in extension and lateral bending (0.53<R(2)<0.63). There was no such correlation in flexion trials. It was concluded that lumbar spine stability increased with increased trunk load magnitude to the extent that this load brought about an increase in trunk muscle activation. Indirectly, our data suggest that muscle reflex response to sudden loading can augment the lumbar spine stability level achieved immediately prior to the sudden loading event.", "citingTitle": "Evaluation of trunk muscle activity in chronic low back pain patients and healthy individuals during holding loads.", "citedTitle": "Effects of external trunk loads on lumbar spine stability."}

Here, we demonstrate that host protein PSF (PTB associated splicing factor) interacts with the cloverleaf RNA as well as the IRES element. PSF was found to be an important IRES trans acting factor (ITAF) for efficient translation of CVB3 RNA. Interestingly, cytoplasmic abundance of PSF protein increased during CVB3 infection and this is regulated by phosphorylation status at two different amino acid positions. Further, PSF protein was up-regulated in CVB3 infection. The expression of CVB3\u20132A protease alone could also induce increased PSF protein levels. Furthermore, we observed the presence of an IRES element in the 5\u2032UTR of PSF mRNA, which is activated during CVB3 infection and might contribute to the elevated levels of PSF. It appears that PSF IRES is also positively regulated by PTB, which is known to regulate CVB3 IRES.

The model is able to reproduce the most dominant changes in the EEG and suggests that they are caused by the amplification of resonances within the thalamo-cortical system. Specifically, while observed increases in delta and alpha power are reflections of amplified resonances in the respective frequency bands, increases in theta power are caused indirectly by spectral power leakage from delta and alpha bands.

If the brain was to encode a retinal disparity representation (retinal model), i.e., target depth relative to the plane of fixation, each vergence eye movement would require an active update of this representation to preserve depth constancy. Alternatively, if the brain was to store an egocentric distance representation of the target by integrating retinal disparity and vergence signals at the moment of target presentation, this representation should remain stable across subsequent vergence shifts (nonretinal model). We tested between these schemes by measuring errors of human reaching movements (n = 14 subjects) to remembered targets, briefly presented before a vergence eye movement. For comparison, we also tested their directional accuracy across version eye movements. With intervening vergence shifts, the memory-guided reaches showed an error pattern that was based on the new eye position and on the depth of the remembered target relative to that position. This suggests that target depth is recomputed after the gaze shift, supporting the retinal model. Our results also confirm earlier literature showing retinal updating of target direction. Furthermore, regression analyses revealed updating gains close to one for both target depth and direction, suggesting that the errors arise after the updating stage during the subsequent reference frame transformations that are involved in reaching.", "citedAbstract": "An experiment investigated in human adults the sensorimotor transformation involved in pointing to a spatial target identified previously by kinesthetic cues.

Constant errors were large but consistent and remarkably similar across conditions, suggesting that, whatever the locating hand, target position is coded in an extrinsic frame of reference (target position hypothesis). The main difference between the same-hand (RR) and different-hand (LR) conditions was a symmetric shift of the pattern of endpoints with respect to the midsagittal plane. This effect was modeled accurately by assuming a systematic bias in the perception of the postural angles of the locating arm. The analysis of the variable errors indicated that target position is represented internally in a spherical coordinate system centered on the shoulder of the pointing arm and that the main source of variability is within the planning stage of the pointing movement. Locating and pointing postures depended systematically on target position. We tested qualitatively the hypothesis that the selection of both postures (inverse kinematic problem) is constrained by a minimum-distance principle. In condition RR, pointing posture depended also on the locating posture, implying the presence of a memory trace of the previous movement.

A divergence between the animal and protist mechanisms is the enzymatic target: the animal transcriptional factor subunit hypoxia inducible factor-\u03b1 whose hydroxylation results in its poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and the protist E3SCFubiquitin ligase subunit Skp1 whose hydroxylation might control the stability of other proteins. In Dictyostelium, genetic studies show that hydroxylation of Skp1 by PhyA, and subsequent glycosylation of the hydroxyproline, is required for normal oxygen sensing during multicellular development at an air/water interface. Because it has been difficult to detect an effect of hypoxia on Skp1 hydroxylation itself, the role of Skp1 modification was investigated in a submerged model of Dictyostelium development dependent on atmospheric hyperoxia.ResultsIn static isotropic conditions beneath 70-100% atmospheric oxygen, amoebae formed radially symmetrical cyst-like aggregates consisting of a core of spores and undifferentiated cells surrounded by a cortex of stalk cells. Analysis of mutants showed that cyst formation was inhibited by high Skp1 levels via a hydroxylation-dependent mechanism, and spore differentiation required core glycosylation of Skp1 by a mechanism that could be bypassed by excess Skp1. Failure of spores to differentiate at lower oxygen correlated qualitatively with reduced Skp1 hydroxylation.ConclusionWe propose that, in the physiological range, oxygen or downstream metabolic effectors control the timing of developmental progression via activation of newly synthesized Skp1.", "citedAbstract": "O(2) regulates multicellular development of the social amoeba Dictyostelium, suggesting it may serve as an important cue in its native soil environment. Dictyostelium expresses an HIF\u03b1-type prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H1) whose levels affect the O(2)-threshold for culmination implicating it as a direct O(2)-sensor, as in animals. But Dictyostelium lacks HIF\u03b1, a mediator of animal prolyl 4-hydroxylase signaling, and P4H1 can hydroxylate Pro143 of Skp1, a subunit of E3(SCF)ubiquitin-ligases. Skp1 hydroxyproline then becomes the target of five sequential glycosyltransferase reactions that modulate the O(2)-signal. Here we show that genetically induced changes in Skp1 levels also affect the O(2)-threshold, in opposite direction to that of the modification enzymes suggesting that the latter reduce Skp1 activity. Consistent with this, overexpressed Skp1 is poorly hydroxylated and Skp1 is the only P4H1 substrate detectable in extracts. Effects of Pro143 mutations, and of combinations of Skp1 and enzyme level perturbations, are consistent with pathway modulation of Skp1 activity. However, some effects were not mirrored by changes in modification of the bulk Skp1 pool, implicating a Skp1 subpopulation and possibly additional unknown factors. Altered Skp1 levels also affected other developmental transitions in a modification-dependent fashion. Whereas hydroxylation of animal HIF\u03b1 results in its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, Dictyostelium Skp1 levels were little affected by its modification status.

Clear differences in silencing efficiency were observed. The 35SGBP-IR construct, containing sequences from \u2212766 to \u2212168\u00a0bp relative to the transcription initiation site (TIS), induced weak silencing effects in 57\u201360% of the transformants. Weak silencing effects were also induced by the ASP-IR construct harbouring allele-specific sequences covering the region from \u2212531 to \u2212330\u00a0bp relative to the TIS, but only in a low percentage (4\u20135.5%) of the transformants. These percentages are too low to distinguish effects between the two potato cultivars. Therefore, this approach cannot be used to induce allele-specific TGS. Strong silencing effects were obtained in 49% of the transformants harbouring the full promoter inverted repeat construct. This construct contained sequences from \u2212766 to +194\u00a0bp relative to the TIS. In the strongly silenced transformants no GBSSI mRNA could be detected by Northern blot analysis. This was accompanied by the accumulation of GBSSI promoter-specific small interfering RNAs. Methylation studies revealed that, in the weakly silenced 35SGBP-IR transformants, the HpaII site at \u2212213\u00a0bp relative to the TIS was methylated. Apparently, methylation of this sequence does not result in strong silencing effects. In the full promoter transformants, both CG methylation and CNN methylation were detected.

PTGS is induced by deliberate [1-4] or fortuitous production (R.v.B., unpublished data) of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). TGS could be the result of DNA pairing [5], but could also be the result of dsRNA, as was shown by the dsRNA-induced inactivation of a transgenic promoter [6]. Here, we show that when targeting flower pigmentation genes in Petunia, transgenes expressing dsRNA can induce PTGS when coding sequences are used and TGS when promoter sequences are taken. For both types of silencing, small RNA species are found, which are thought to be dsRNA decay products [7] and determine the sequence specificity of the silencing process [8, 9]. Furthermore, silencing is accompanied by the methylation of DNA sequences that are homologous to dsRNA. DNA methylation is assumed to be essential for regulating TGS and important for reinforcing PTGS [10]. Therefore, we conclude that TGS and PTGS are mechanistically related. In addition, we show that dsRNA-induced TGS provides an efficient tool to generate gene knockouts, because not only does the TGS of a PTGS-inducing transgene fully revert the PTGS phenotype, but also an endogenous gene can be transcriptionally silenced by dsRNA corresponding to its promoter.", "citingTitle": "Efficiency of transcriptional gene silencing of GBSSI in potato depends on the promoter region that is used in an inverted repeat", "citedTitle": "Transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene silencing are mechanistically related"}

Although 67% of antigenic variation was predictable from the glycoprotein amino acid sequence, there are in some cases substantial differences between genetic and antigenic distances, thus highlighting the risk of inferring antigenic relationships solely from sequence data at this time. These differences included epidemiologically important antigenic differences between vaccine strains and wild-type rabies viruses. Further, we quantitatively assessed the antigenic relationships measured by using rabbit, mouse, and human sera, validating the use of nonhuman experimental animals as a model for determining antigenic variation in humans.

Telephone numbers were randomly drawn from all Austrian telephone books and transformed using the random last digits method. The last birthday method was employed to choose the target person for the interviews.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOut of our subjects, 2.5% fulfilled criteria for the seasonal pattern specifier according to DSM-5 and 2.4% (95% CI=1.4-3.5%) were diagnosed with SAD. When applying the ICD-10 criteria 1.9% (95% CI=0.9-2.8%) fulfilled SAD diagnostic criteria.

Platelets normally circulate in a quiescent state. Upon activation, platelets can secrete and present various molecules, change their shape as well as the expression pattern of adhesion molecules. These changes are associated with the adhesion of platelets to leukocytes and the vessel wall. The interaction of platelets with neutrophils promotes the recruitment of neutrophils into inflammatory tissue and thus participates in host defense. This interaction of neutrophils with platelets is mainly mediated through P-selectin and beta(2) and beta(3) integrins (CD11b/CD18, CD41/CD61). Platelets can also interact with endothelial cells and monocytes. Adherent platelets promote the 'secondary capture' of neutrophils and other leukocytes. In addition, platelets secrete neutrophil and endothelial activators inducing production of inflammatory cytokines.

It is linked to a deletion in the dyt1 gene, resulting in a mutated form of the protein torsinA. The penetrance for dystonia is incomplete, but both clinically affected and non-manifesting carriers of the DYT1 mutation exhibit impaired motor learning and evidence of altered motor plasticity. Here, we characterized striatal glutamatergic synaptic plasticity in transgenic mice expressing either the normal human torsinA or its mutant form, in comparison to non-transgenic (NT) control mice. Medium spiny neurons recorded from both NT and normal human torsinA mice exhibited normal long-term depression (LTD), whereas in mutant human torsinA littermates LTD could not be elicited. In addition, although long-term potentiation (LTP) could be induced in all the mice, it was greater in magnitude in mutant human torsinA mice. Low-frequency stimulation (LFS) can revert potentiated synapses to resting levels, a phenomenon termed synaptic depotentiation. LFS induced synaptic depotentiation (SD) both in NT and normal human torsinA mice, but not in mutant human torsinA mice. Since anti-cholinergic drugs are an effective medical therapeutic option for the treatment of human dystonia, we reasoned that an excess in endogenous acetylcholine could underlie the synaptic plasticity impairment. Indeed, both LTD and SD were rescued in mutant human torsinA mice either by lowering endogenous acetylcholine levels or by antagonizing muscarinic M1 receptors. The presence of an enhanced acetylcholine tone was confirmed by the observation that acetylcholinesterase activity was significantly increased in the striatum of mutant human torsinA mice, as compared with both normal human torsinA and NT littermates. Moreover, we found similar alterations of synaptic plasticity in muscarinic M2/M4 receptor knockout mice, in which an increased striatal acetylcholine level has been documented. The loss of LTD and SD on one hand, and the increase in LTP on the other, demonstrate that a 'loss of inhibition' characterizes the impairment of synaptic plasticity in this model of DYT1 dystonia. More importantly, our results indicate that an unbalanced cholinergic transmission plays a pivotal role in these alterations, providing a clue to understand the ability of anticholinergic agents to restore motor deficits in dystonia.", "citedAbstract": "Muscarinic autoreceptors regulate cholinergic tone in the striatum. We investigated the functional consequences of genetic deletion of striatal muscarinic autoreceptors by means of electrophysiological recordings from either medium spiny neurons (MSNs) or cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) in slices from single M4 or double M2/M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) knock-out (\u2212/\u2212) mice. In control ChIs, the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine (300 nm) produced a self-inhibitory outward current that was mostly reduced in M4\u2212/\u2212 and abolished in M2/M4\u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting an involvement of both M2 and M4 autoreceptors. In MSNs from both M4\u2212/\u2212 and M2/M4\u2212/\u2212 mice, muscarine caused a membrane depolarization that was prevented by the M1 receptor-preferring antagonist pirenzepine (100 nm), suggesting that M1 receptor function was unaltered. Acetylcholine has been involved in striatal long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD) induction. Loss of muscarinic autoreceptor function is predicted to affect synaptic plasticity by modifying striatal cholinergic tone. Indeed, high-frequency stimulation of glutamatergic afferents failed to induce LTD in MSNs from both M4\u2212/\u2212 and M2/M4\u2212/\u2212 mice, as well as in wild-type mice pretreated with the M2/M4 antagonist AF-DX384 (11-[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,1 1-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3b][1,4] benzodiazepin-6-one). Interestingly, LTD could be restored by either pirenzepine (100 nm) or hemicholinium-3 (10 \u03bcm), a depletor of endogenous ACh. Conversely, LTP induction did not show any difference among the three mouse strains and was prevented by pirenzepine. These results demonstrate that M2/M4 muscarinic autoreceptors regulate ACh release from striatal ChIs. As a consequence, endogenous ACh drives the polarity of bidirectional synaptic plasticity.", "citingTitle": "Impairment of bidirectional synaptic plasticity in the striatum of a mouse model of DYT1 dystonia: role of endogenous acetylcholine.", "citedTitle": "Loss of Muscarinic Autoreceptor Function Impairs Long-Term Depression But Not Long-Term Potentiation in the Striatum"}

Repression of UBC9 synthesis prevents cell cycle progression at the G2 or early M phase, causing the accumulation of large budded cells with a single nucleus, a short spindle and replicated DNA.

Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), a protonophore that dissipates the H+ gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria, induces apoptosis in many cell types. In rat and human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC), FCCP opened the large-conductance, voltage- and Ca2+-sensitive KK+ (maxi-K) channels, increased K+ currents through maxi-K channels [I(K(Ca))], and induced apoptosis. Tetraethylammonia (1 mM) and iberiotoxin (100 nM) decreased I(K(Ca)) by blocking the sarcolemmal maxi-K channels and inhibited the FCCP-induced apoptosis in PASMC cultured in media containing serum and growth factors. Furthermore, inhibition of K+ efflux by raising extracellular K+ concentration from 5 to 40 mM also attenuated PASMC apoptosis induced by FCCP and the K+ ionophore valinomycin. These results suggest that FCCP-mediated apoptosis in PASMC is partially due to an increase of maxi-K channel activity.

Although software simulators are usually considered, they consist of high-computational intensive tasks, which require hours to days to be completed.

Though this hysteresis has been commented on in published literature, it has not been quantified.ResultsSixty-six bladder afferents recorded from sacral dorsal root ganglia in five alpha-chloralose anesthetized felines were identified based on their characteristic responses to pressure (correlation coefficient\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.2) during saline infusion (2\u00a0ml/min). For saline infusion trials, we calculated a maximum hysteresis ratio between the firing rate difference at each pressure and the overall firing rate range (or Hmax) of 0.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation) and mean hysteresis ratio (or Hmean) of 0.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13 (n\u00a0=\u00a046 afferents).

Therefore, there is still a need for a more effective electrical neuromodulation scheme to restore bladder function. Intravesical pressure (IVP) is the major biosignal that reflects the state of bladder conditions. The present study develops a closed-loop control strategy for improving bladder emptying and verifies its performance using animal experiments. Two channel outputs of electrical currents triggered by IVP-feedback signals were set to automatically regulate a rat's pudendal nerve for selective nerve stimulation and blocking. Under this experimental design, a series of in vivo animal experiments were conducted on anesthetized rats, including the computational characterization of biosignals, the development of an intermittent high-frequency blocking current waveform for blocking the nerve, and verification of the control strategy. Results show that the IVP-feedback control strategy for dual-channel pudendal neuromodulation performed well in animal experiments and could be utilized to selectively stimulate and block the pudendal nerve to augment bladder contraction and restore external urethral sphincter bursting activity to improve bladder emptying.

The amounts of p-DCB absorbed daily and the internal accumulation in chronic low-level exposure were extrapolated using the estimated toxicokinetic parameters. p-DCB was transferred from inhaled air to the body with a constant high absorption rate during exposure. The major route for elimination from the body was urinary excretion followed by metabolism, not exhalation. However, during 9\u201311\u00a0h after the start of exposure, the fraction of p-DCB excreted in urine was only 5\u201316% of the amount absorbed. Furthermore, most of the absorbed p-DCB seemed to be distributed rapidly to the tissues, such as fat, according to toxicokinetic analysis. Consequently, p-DCB seems to require a long time to be completely eliminated from the body. The amounts of daily absorption and internal accumulation were extrapolated to average 0.27\u00a0mg/day and 2.9\u00a0mg, respectively, in the subjects exposed chronically to 1\u00a0ppb of p-DCB. The amount absorbed daily agreed approximately with that extrapolated from rats which inhaled p-DCB in our previous study.", "citedAbstract": "The biotransformation and kinetics of 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB) were studied in male Wistar rats at three oral dose levels (10, 50 and 250 mg/kg). The effect of induction of CYP2E1 by isoniazid on the kinetics and biotransformation was determined. Excretion was predominantly via the urine (78-85%) and to a small extent via the faeces (2-5%). The relative contributions of these routes were not dose dependent. Excretion via the bile ranged from less than 5% at the low dose level to 30% at the high dose level. The major biliary metabolite was the glucuronide of 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-DCP). The time point at which the plasma concentrations of the parent compound and the metabolites were maximal (TCmax) as well as the maximum concentrations (Cmax) increased with higher dose level. Induction by isoniazid resulted in a faster urinary elimination, whereas TCmax and Cmax were lower for induced rats. In addition, the area under the blood curve (AUC) was smaller and total clearance was higher for induced rats. 1,4-DCB was mainly metabolized to 2,5-DCP (ca. 90%), which was detected in the urine as its sulfate (50-60%), glucuronide (20-30%) and the free form (5-10%). Minor metabolites were the N-acetyl-cysteine-S-dihydro-hydroxy-1,4-dichlorobenzene and the corresponding dehydrated N-acetyl-cysteine-S-1,4-dichlorobenzene, which comprised ca. 10% of total metabolites.

Thirty two FTCs and 34 FTAs were retrieved for evaluation. The average age of patients with FTA was 8 years younger than FTC (p = 0.02). The female to male ratio for follicular neoplasm was 25:8. The average size of FTC was larger than FTA (p = 0.003).

Patients with two or more of these predictors were classified as being high risk. These patients had 5- and 20-year survival rates of 47% and 8%, respectively; the corresponding survival data for the low-risk group were 99% at 5 years and 86% at 20 years.

Consequently, the use of traditional mechanical circulatory support in end-stage patients has been difficult. In contrast, HFpEF is also characterized by a large LA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nHemodynamic characteristics of 4 distinct HFpEF phenotypes were characterized from the published data: 1) hypertrophic cardiomyopathies; 2) infiltrative diseases; 3) nonhypertrophic HFpEF; and 4) HFpEF with common cardiovascular comorbidities (e.g., hypertension). Employing a previously-described cardiovascular simulation, the effects of a low-flow, micropump-based LA decompression device were modeled. The effect of sourcing blood from the LV versus the LA was compared.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor all HFpEF phenotypes, mechanical circulatory support significantly increased cardiac output, provided a mild increase in blood pressure, and markedly reduced pulmonary and LA pressures. LV sourcing of blood reduced LV end-systolic volume into a range likely to induce suction. With LA sourcing, however, LV end-systolic volume increased compared with baseline. Due to pre-existing LA enlargement, LA volumes remained sufficiently elevated, thus minimizing the risk of suction.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis theoretical analysis suggests that a strategy involving pumping blood from the LA to the arterial system may provide a viable option for end-stage HFpEF. Special considerations apply to each of the 4 types of HFpEF phenotypes described.

Overall, 6\u00a0% (5/90) of trials appropriately registered a sample size which was unchanged from the interval between registration and publication, and only 12\u00a0% (11/90) reported primary outcomes that were both appropriately registered and unchanged.ConclusionsNon-registration, or registration after trial initiation, are common in RCTs of critically ill patients. Among registered trials important protocol changes are often made between trial commencement and publication. This study identifies and quantifies the extent of this serious\u2014but correctable\u2014problem for RCTs in critically ill patients.", "citingTitle": "Comparison of registered and published outcomes in randomized controlled trials: a systematic review", "citedTitle": "Registration and design alterations of clinical trials in critical care: a cross-sectional observational study"}

The response rate near a memorized duration has a Gaussian shape centered on the to-be-timed interval (criterion time). The width of the Gaussian-like distribution of responses increases linearly with the criterion time, i.e., interval timing obeys the scalar property.ResultsWe presented analytical and numerical results based on the striatal beat frequency (SBF) model showing that parameter variability (noise) mimics behavioral data. A key functional block of the SBF model is the set of oscillators that provide the time base for the entire timing network. The implementation of the oscillators block as simplified phase (cosine) oscillators has the additional advantage that is analytically tractable. We also checked numerically that the scalar property emerges in the presence of memory variability by using biophysically realistic Morris-Lecar oscillators. First, we predicted analytically and tested numerically that in a noise-free SBF model the output function could be approximated by a Gaussian. However, in a noise-free SBF model the width of the Gaussian envelope is independent of the criterion time, which violates the scalar property. We showed analytically and verified numerically that small fluctuations of the memorized criterion time leads to scalar property of interval timing.ConclusionsNoise is ubiquitous in the form of small fluctuations of intrinsic frequencies of the neural oscillators, the errors in recording/retrieving stored information related to criterion time, fluctuation in neurotransmitters\u2019 concentration, etc. Our model suggests that the biological noise plays an essential functional role in the SBF interval timing.", "citedAbstract": "Humans and other animals demonstrate the ability to perceive and respond to temporally relevant information with characteristic behavioral properties. For example, the response time distributions in peak-interval timing tasks are well described by Gaussian functions, and superimpose when scaled by the criterion duration. This superimposition has been referred to as the scalar property and results from the fact that the standard deviation of a temporal estimate is proportional to the duration being timed. Various psychological models have been proposed to account for such responding. These models vary in their success in predicting the temporal control of behavior as well as in the neurobiological feasibility of the mechanisms they postulate. A review of the major interval timing models reveals that no current model is successful on both counts. The neurobiological properties of the basal ganglia, an area known to be necessary for interval timing and motor control, suggests that this set of structures act as a coincidence detector of cortical and thalamic input. The hypothesized functioning of the basal ganglia is similar to the mechanisms proposed in the beat frequency timing model [R.C. Miall, Neural Computation 1 (1989) 359-371], leading to a reevaluation of its capabilities in terms of behavioral prediction. By implementing a probabilistic firing rule, a dynamic response threshold, and adding variance to a number of its components, simulations of the striatal beat frequency model were able to produce output that is functionally equivalent to the expected behavioral response form of peak-interval timing procedures.", "citingTitle": "Why noise is useful in functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing?", "citedTitle": "Cortico-striatal circuits and interval timing: coincidence detection of oscillatory processes."}

However, little is known about the effects of invasive alien plants on ant populations, particularly as regards the density, spatial distribution and size of ant colonies, as well as their foraging behaviour. We addressed these questions in a study of grassland ant communities on five grasslands invaded by alien goldenrods (Solidago sp.) and on five non-invaded grasslands without this plant. In each grassland, seven 100\u00a0m2 plots were selected and the ant colonies counted. Ant species richness and colony density was lower in the plots on the invaded grasslands. Moreover, both of these traits were higher in the plots near the grassland edge and with a higher number of plant species in the grasslands invaded by goldenrods but not in the non-invaded ones. On average, ant colony size was lower on the invaded grasslands than the non-invaded ones. Also, ant workers travelled for longer distances to collect food items in the invaded areas than they did in the non-invaded ones, even after the experimental removal of some ant colonies in order to exclude the effect of higher colony density in the latter. Our results indicate that invasive alien goldenrods have a profound negative effect on grassland ant communities which may lead to a cascade effect on the whole grassland ecosystem through modification of the interactions among species.

We used a general regression model to perform a backward stepwise elimination of explanatory variables. These were the number of workers removed on sticks, temperature at the nest and site (a categorical variable). In case of each species the final model contained only the number of workers removed as a significant variable.

Paired 3D montages were produced by graphically resizing Bahinia to the same molar lengths as the reference fossils and aligning them according to the contour and position of the inferior orbital margin. The composites indicate that while the orbit of Bahinia appears to be relatively small, as previously reported, its placement more closely resembles the laterally facing orbit of Notharctus than the anteriorly facing orbit of Rooneyia, which resembles anthropoids. In the size and shape of the snout, depth of the maxilla, and orientation of the toothrow in the face, Bahinia shares a distinctive resemblance with Notharctus, not with Rooneyia. Since the dental and gnathic features presented as evidence that Bahinia is an anthropoid also are often found among adapiforms, in which case they are generally understood to be convergent similarities to some anthropoid characters, we conclude that a more cogent argument can be made that Bahinia is a strepsirhine, with a large face and small, laterally facing orbits. Bahinia thus contributes little to the argument that the Chinese eosimiids are anthropoids. INTRODUCTION J et al. (1999) described Bahinia pondaungensis from three associated specimens\u2014a moderately large left and right maxilla and a lower jaw\u2014recovered from the middle Eocene Pondaung Formation of Myanmar. They viewed the species as an early anthropoid, citing features relating to mandibular morphology, upper incisor orientation, obliquity of lower premolars, trigonid cusp structure, and hypocone development. Several studies have since accepted this interpretation (e.g., Beard 2002; Chaimanee et al. 2000; Kay et al. 2004; Marivaux et al. 2005; Takai et al. 2005) without reservation and none of the features invoked by Jaeger et al. (1999) have been reassessed or challenged in detail, with the exception of the character analysis by Gunnell and Miller (2001). This defining list of traits overlaps considerably the battery of features long used to support the adapid-anthropoid hypothesis and now regarded as likely convergences (e.g., Rosenberger et al. 1985). Kay et al. (2004) also added to the basic argument of Jaeger et al. (1999) by suggesting that the orbit of Bahinia, as inferred from the radius of curvature of its inferior margin, was relatively small as in typical anthropoids. The thrust of this work has led to the inclusion of Bahinia in the Family Eosimiidae, and this has had two seemingly contradictory effects: 1) adding credibility to the hypothesis that eosimiids are anthropoids; and, 2) expanding the morphological concept of eosimiids to embrace highly disparate tooth and mandibular morphologies, i.e., creatPaleoAnthropology 2007: 26\u221230.

However, as perhaps the literature\u2019s sole doubters, Miller et al. (2005) noted that the case for Bahinia being an anthropoid is tied to the status of Eosimias, whose anthropoid affinities they tend to question. And, in the parsimony analysis of Seiffert et al. (2005), Bahinia fell immediately outside a clade comprised of definitive anthropoids plus amphipithecids, while Eosimias and the allied Phenacopithecus (plus the controversial Altiatlasius) were linked as another lineage further outside that group. The right maxilla of Bahinia preserves the morphology of the snout and an integral segment of the orbit (Kay et al. 2004: Figure 8). The specimen is full of cracks and has probably suffered some distortion via bilateral compression and displacement of fragments high up between the orbit and nasal aperture. nevertheless, it appears to preserve a faithful approximation of the shape of the lateral aspect of the face, especially in the maxillary region between toothrow and orbit. The segment of the inferior orbital margin that Kay et al. (2004) used as a basis for judging orbit size remains fairly intact. We have focused on that anatomical remnant as a basis for asking a question that may have important bearing on the affinities of the genus: What was the orientation of the orbits in the face? As is well known, anthropoids have orbits that are both relatively small and markedly convergent and frontated (see Cartmill 1980; Ross 1995) rather than laterally facing. Affinities of Bahinia \u2022 27 MATERIALS AND METHODS In the absence of a reference midline or standard horizontal on the fossil from which the angles describing the orbital plane can be easily measured as intersections (e.g., Ross 1995), we developed an alternative comparative graphical approach to the problem. We compared the shapes of comparable parts of the faces and maxillae in the genera Bahinia, Notharctus, and Rooneyia by using fixed-point overlays of 3D models based on laser surface scans of sharp epoxy casts. Notharctus and Rooneyia were selected as models for several reasons. All three are relatively small-eyed. Their Eocene ages makes for a pointed comparison with the middle Eocene Bahinia and it also means that their morphology is more likely to reflect the primitive states of early euprimate clades than any modern forms. From a systematics perspective, each of the analogs also represents a major euprimate division. Notharctus was used as an example of the strepsirhine condition, where the orbits tend to be laterally directed, while Rooneyia was used as an exemplar of a small-eyed haplorhine. Ross (1995) also has shown that Rooneyia is essentially indistinguishable from anthropoids in orbital orientation, so it serves as a good surrogate for an anthropoid. Following Rosenberger (2006; see also Hogg et al. 2005), Rooneyia has even more relevance for anthropoid origins than being merely a morphological model because there are other derived features of the frontal bone and orbital region which suggest that this genus may represent the sister-group of anthropoids, Protoanthropoidea, rather than an omomyid (as it is often classified) of more remote affinities. We developed 3D digital models of the specimens and compared them visually by generating fixed-point overlays on-screen using the inferior orbital margins as a common reference surface. The models were constructed by renderFigure 1. A composite of two 3D models based on laser surface scans of notharctus and bahinia. Red arrows mark the position of the notharctus canine. All the images are of the same composite, shown here in four different views (clockwise from top left\u2014three quarters, superior, anterior, and palatal). The notharctus skull is not distorted on the right side. Molars of the two fossils were scaled to approximately the same mesiodistal length and the composite was produced by fixed-point alignment of the inferior margins of the orbits in the specimens. The size and shape of bahinia conforms well with notharctus in the snout, the lateral aspect of the face below the orbit, and the toothrow. The canine falls short of the notharctus canine due to different premolar proportions, but the right toothrows are aligned fairly well. Overall, the complimentary match between the shapes of these specimens indicates that their orbits are arranged similarly. 28 \u2022 PaleoAnthropology 2007 ing a solid surface from the coordinate points collected by a high-resolution laser scanner as it mapped the morphology of the specimens. The thickness of each model\u2019s rendered surface is negligible, less than 1mm. To accommodate differences in the absolute sizes of the species, we resized the digital models of Bahinia to the same molar lengths of Notharctus and Rooneyia, respectively, in each set of comparisons, thus scaling the entire solid model isomorphically in length, breadth, and height dimensions. This technique is similar to the long standing method of illustrating specimens as 2D flat images brought to a standard anatomical length or breadth, with the original aspect ratio of each maintained and aligning them symmetrically on a page. ANALYSIS Figures 1 and 2 compare Bahinia with Notharctus and Rooneyia in a set of 3D composite models, shown from different angles. These composites were developed by joining pairs of 3D models along the matching arcs of their inferior orbital margins. because the margin is an arc that crosses the three orthogonal standard anatomical planes, matching them in three-space has the effect of also \u201cforcing\u201d the alignment of other anatomical features, such as the toothrows. Mismatches between anatomical structures would thus be an indication that specimens have different shapes. The generally close correspondence of the Bahinia facial specimen with the snout shapes of Notharctus and Rooneyia adds confidence to the supposition that the Bahinia specimen is not blatantly distorted in places where it counts most for this study, in the suborbital region. Furthermore, close inspection of the direct congruity between the contours of the inferior orbital margin of Bahinia and the other fossils in these graphic comparisons corroborates the interpretation of Kay et al. (2004) that the orbit of Bahinia was not enlarged. However, our observations also suggest that the orbits of Bahinia were laterally oriented rather th", "citedAbstract": "A new genus and species of anthropoid primate, Bahinia pondaungensis gen. et sp. nov., is described from the Yashe Kyitchaung locality in the Late Middle Eocene Pondaung Formation (Myanmar).

Aggressive gliomas\u2019 Achilles\u2019 heel ATRX is a protein that is often mutated in glioma, a lethal and relatively common brain tumor. Koschmann et al. developed a mouse model of ATRX-deficient glioma and discovered that these tumors grow more aggressively than their counterparts with wild-type ATRX. The reason this happens is that the loss of ATRX impairs DNA repair, resulting in genetically unstable tumors that can accumulate oncogenic mutations more quickly. However, because of their DNA repair defect, these tumors also proved to be more sensitive to treatments that damage the DNA, such as radiation and some types of chemotherapy. Consistent with these findings, the presence of ATRX mutation correlated with better outcomes in patients, because these tumors were more susceptible to treatment. Recent work in human glioblastoma (GBM) has documented recurrent mutations in the histone chaperone protein ATRX. We developed an animal model of ATRX-deficient GBM and showed that loss of ATRX reduces median survival and increases genetic instability. Further, analysis of genome-wide data for human gliomas showed that ATRX mutation is associated with increased mutation rate at the single-nucleotide variant (SNV) level. In mouse tumors, ATRX deficiency impairs nonhomologous end joining and increases sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents that induce double-stranded DNA breaks. We propose that ATRX loss results in a genetically unstable tumor, which is more aggressive when left untreated but is more responsive to double-stranded DNA-damaging agents, resulting in improved overall survival.", "citedAbstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal brain tumour in adults and children.

Recurrent mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant H3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (K27M, G34R/G34V) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. Mutations in ATRX (\u03b1-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked) and DAXX (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for H3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a G34R or G34V H3.3 mutation.

The objective was to compare the acute and sustained effects of lucinactant among premature lambs with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) with the effects of a natural porcine surfactant (poractant-\u03b1). METHODS. After 5 minutes of mechanical ventilation twin premature lambs were assigned randomly to the lucinactant group (30 mg/mL, 5.8 mL/kg) or the poractant-\u03b1 group (80 mg/mL, 2.2 mL/kg). Heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, arterial pH, blood gas values, and lung mechanics were recorded for 12 hours. RESULTS. Baseline fetal pH values were similar for the 2 groups (pH 7.27).

Patients with cardiovascular disease have been identified as the largest group which need to be protected from effects of urban air pollution. Methods We sought to estimate associations between indicators of urban air pollution and daily mortality using time series of daily TSP, PM 10 , PM 2.5 , NO 2 , SO 2 , O 3 and nontrauma deaths in Vienna (Austria) 2000\u20132004. We used polynomial distributed lag analysis adjusted for seasonality, daily temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and incidence of influenza as registered by sentinels. Results All three particulate measures and NO 2 were associated with mortality from all causes and from ischemic heart disease and COPD at all ages and in the elderly. The magnitude of the effect was largest for PM 2.5 and NO 2 . Best predictor of mortality increase lagged 0\u20137 days was PM 2.5 (for ischemic heart disease and COPD) and NO 2 (for other heart disease and all causes). Total mortality increase, lagged 0\u201314 days, per 10\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m \u22123 was 2.6% for PM 2.5 and 2.9% for NO 2 , mainly due to cardiopulmonary and cerebrovascular causes. Conclusion Acute and subacute lethal effects of urban air pollution are predicted by PM 2.5 and NO 2 increase even at relatively low levels of these pollutants. This is consistent with results on hospital admissions and the lack of a threshold. While harvesting (reduction of mortality after short increase due to premature deaths of most sensitive persons) seems to be of minor importance, deaths accumulate during 14 days after an increase of air pollutants. The limit values for PM 2.5 and NO 2 proposed for 2010 in the European Union are unable to prevent serious health effects.", "citedAbstract": "Air pollution consists of both gaseous and particulate-matter pollutants. The former include nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and sulphur dioxide (SO2). The latter consist of particulate matter of varying aerodynamic diameter, as defined by cutoff points\u2014for example, particles with diameters of ,10 mm (PM10) or ,2.5 mm (PM2.5). Because of their small size, these particles can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and deposited in the alveoli. Why should cardiologists care about ambient air? It has long been known that air pollution can adversely affect human health. Extreme levels of pollution may cause markedly increased mortality rates; in this regard one often refers to the Meuse valley fog of 1930 or the London smog of 1952. These episodes initiated successful efforts and legislation to reduce air pollution. Nevertheless, even at current ambient pollution levels, the relation between pollution and excess morbidity and mortality still exists. However, the nature of the pollutants and the type of health effects have shifted, with a special emphasis now being placed on the heart rather than the lungs. Ma\u0131\u0302tre et al. gathered the available epidemiological evidence on the association between coronary disease and air pollution at current ambient concentrations. From both biological and public health perspectives, one should distinguish between acute and long-term effects of air pollution.", "citingTitle": "Extended effects of air pollution on cardiopulmonary mortality in Vienna", "citedTitle": "Air pollution: To the heart of the matter."}

The different elements of the hair bundle, the stereocilia and a kinocilium, are interconnected by a variety of link types. One of these links, the tip link, connects the top of a shorter stereocilium with the lateral membrane of an adjacent taller stereocilium and may gate the mechanotransducer channel of the hair cell. Mass spectrometric and Western blot analyses identify the tip-link antigen, a hitherto unidentified antigen specifically associated with the tip and kinocilial links of sensory hair bundles in the inner ear and the ciliary calyx of photoreceptors in the eye, as an avian ortholog of human protocadherin-15, a product of the gene for the deaf/blindness Usher syndrome type 1F/DFNB23 locus. Multiple protocadherin-15 transcripts are shown to be expressed in the mouse inner ear, and these define four major isoform classes, two with entirely novel, previously unidentified cytoplasmic domains. Antibodies to the three cytoplasmic domain-containing isoform classes reveal that each has a different spatiotemporal expression pattern in the developing and mature inner ear. Two isoforms are distributed in a manner compatible for association with the tip-link complex. An isoform located at the tips of stereocilia is sensitive to calcium chelation and proteolysis with subtilisin and reappears at the tips of stereocilia as transduction recovers after the removal of calcium chelators. Protocadherin-15 is therefore associated with the tip-link complex and may be an integral component of this structure and/or required for its formation.", "citedAbstract": "Tip links are extracellular, cell-surface-associated filaments of unknown molecular composition that are thought to gate the mechanotransducer channel of the sensory hair cell. They disappear from the hair bundle in response to calcium chelation and lanthanum treatment and resist degradation by the protease subtilisin. A monoclonal antibody derived from a hybridoma screen identified a novel antigen associated with tip links, the tip-link antigen. The tip-link antigen is also associated with kinocilial links, subtilisin-resistant filaments that are sensitive to calcium chelation and connect the kinocilium to the tallest stereocilia of the hair bundle. Furthermore, the tip-link antigen is expressed in the retina, where it is associated with the ciliary calyx, a ring of microvilli that surrounds the outer segment of the photoreceptor. The tip-link antigen rapidly disappears from the surface of the hair bundle in response to calcium chelation. It is also subtilisin resistant, relative to the ankle-link antigen, an antigen associated with another type of hair bundle link.

Although sHSPs are characterized by their small monomeric weight, they typically assemble into large polydisperse oligomers that vary in both size and shape but are principally composed of dimeric building blocks. These assemblies can include different sHSP orthologues, creating additional complexity that may affect chaperone activity. However, the structural and functional properties of such hetero-oligomers are poorly understood. We became interested in hetero-oligomer formation between human heat-shock protein family B (small) member 1 (HSPB1) and HSPB6, which are both highly expressed in skeletal muscle. When mixed in vitro, these two sHSPs form a polydisperse oligomer array composed solely of heterodimers, suggesting preferential association that is determined at the monomer level. Previously, we have shown that the sHSP N-terminal domains (NTDs), which have a high degree of intrinsic disorder, are essential for the biased formation. Here we employed iterative deletion mapping to elucidate how the NTD of HSPB6 influences its preferential association with HSPB1 and show that this region has multiple roles in this process. First, the highly conserved motif RLFDQXFG is necessary for subunit exchange among oligomers. Second, a site \u223c20 residues downstream of this motif determines the size of the resultant hetero-oligomers. Third, a region unique to HSPB6 dictates the preferential formation of heterodimers. In conclusion, the disordered NTD of HSPB6 helps regulate the size and stability of hetero-oligomeric complexes, indicating that terminal sHSP regions define the assembly properties of these proteins.", "citedAbstract": "ATP-independent small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs) are an essential component of the cellular chaperoning machinery. Under both normal and stress conditions, sHSPs bind partially unfolded proteins and prevent their irreversible aggregation. Canonical vertebrate sHSPs, such as the \u03b1-crystallins, form large polydisperse oligomers from which smaller, functionally active subspecies dissociate. Here we focus on human HSPB6 which, despite having considerable homology to the \u03b1-crystallins in both the N-terminal region and the signature \u03b1-crystallin domain (ACD), only forms dimers in solution that represent the basic chaperoning subspecies. We addressed the three-dimensional structure and functional properties of HSPB6 in a hybrid study employing X-ray crystallography, solution small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), mutagenesis, size-exclusion chromatography and chaperoning assays. The crystal structure of a proteolytically stable fragment reveals typical ACD dimers which further form tetrameric assemblies as a result of extensive inter-dimer patching of the \u03b24/\u03b28 grooves. The patching is surprisingly mediated by tripeptide motifs, found in the N-terminal domain directly adjacent to the ACD, that are resembling but distinct from the canonical IxI sequence commonly binding this groove. By combining the crystal structure with SAXS data for the full-length protein, we derive a molecular model of the latter. In solution, HSPB6 shows a strong attractive self-interaction, a property that correlates with its chaperoning activity. Both properties are dictated by the unstructured yet compact N-terminal domain, specifically a region highly conserved across vertebrate sHSPs.", "citingTitle": "Specific sequences in the N-terminal domain of human small heat-shock protein HSPB6 dictate preferential hetero-oligomerization with the orthologue HSPB1", "citedTitle": "Molecular structure and dynamics of the dimeric human small heat shock protein HSPB6."}

The importance of oxidative stress in the pathobiology of human TBI is largely unknown. The F(2)-isoprostane 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2\u03b1) (8-iso-PGF(2\u03b1)), synthesized in vivo through non-enzymatic free radical catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid, is a widely used biomarker of oxidative stress in multiple disease states, including TBI and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Our hypothesis is that harvesting of biomarkers directly in the injured brain by cerebral microdialysis (MD) is advantageous because of its high spatial and temporal resolution compared to blood or cerebrospinal fluid sampling. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of measuring 8-iso-PGF(2\u03b1) in MD, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (vCSF), and plasma samples collected from patients with severe TBI, and to compare the MD signals with MD-glycerol, implicated as a biomarker of oxidative stress, as well as MD-glutamate, a biomarker of excitotoxicity. Six patients (4 men, 2 women) were included in the study, three of whom had a focal/mixed TBI, and three a diffuse axonal injury (DAI). Following the bedside analysis of routine MD biomarkers (glucose, lactate:pyruvate ratio, glycerol, and glutamate), two 12-h MD samples per day were used to analyze 8-iso-PGF(2\u03b1) from 24\u2009h up to 8 days post-injury. The interstitial levels of 8-iso-PGF(2\u03b1) were markedly higher than the levels obtained from plasma and vCSF (p<0.05), supporting our hypothesis. The MD-8-iso-PGF(2\u03b1) levels correlated strongly (p<0.05) with MD-glycerol and MD-glutamate, which are widely used biomarkers of membrane phospholipid degradation/oxidative stress and excitotoxicity, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of analyzing 8-iso-PGF(2\u03b1) in MD samples from the human brain.

In the present study, we have investigated the mRNA distribution for these components in the mouse brain by in situ hybridization. The xCT mRNA was expressed in the area postrema, subfornical organ, habenular nucleus, hypothalamic area, and ependymal cells of the lateral wall of the third ventricle in the adult mouse brain. A strong signal was also detected in the meninges in both adult and fetal mouse brains. The mRNA expression of the heavy chain of 4F2 antigen was detected in a more broad area, including all of the regions in which xCT mRNA was detected. These data are compatible with our biochemical evidence that xCT functions in combination with the heavy chain of 4F2 antigen to elicit system xc\u2212 activity.

In this study, we modified several methods for converting hiPSCs into a naive state through the transgenic expression of several reprogramming factors. The resulting cells express the components of the core transcriptional network of mESCs, including ESRRB, at high levels, which suggests the existence of naive-state hiPSCs that are similar to mESCs.

Radiation is typically given with androgen suppression when testosterone levels are at their nadir. Recent reports have shown that androgen stimulation of androgen-deprived prostate cancer cells leads to formation of double-strand breaks (DSB). Here, we exploit this finding and investigate the extent and timing of androgen-induced DSBs and their effect on tumor growth following androgen stimulation in combination with ionizing radiation (IR). Experimental Design: Androgen-induced DNA damage was assessed by comet assays and \u03b3H2A.X foci formation. Effects of androgen stimulation and radiation were determined in vitro and in vivo with xenograft models. Results: We document that androgen treatment of androgen-deprived prostate cancer cell lines resulted in a dose- and time-dependent induction of widespread DSBs. Generation of these breaks was dependent on androgen receptor and topoisomerase II beta but not on cell-cycle progression. In vitro models demonstrated a synergistic interaction between IR and androgen stimulation when IR is given at a time point corresponding with high levels of androgen-induced DSB formation. Furthermore, in vivo studies showed a significant improvement in tumor growth delay when radiation was given shortly after androgen repletion in castrated mice. Conclusions: These results suggest a potential cooperative effect and improved tumor growth delay with androgen-induced DSBs and radiation with implications for improving the therapeutic index of prostate cancer radiation therapy.

Three yeast lineages, including baker\u2019s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have independently developed the metabolic activity to convert simple sugars into ethanol even under fully aerobic conditions. This fermentation capacity, named Crabtree effect, reduces the cell-biomass production but provides in nature a tool to out-compete other microorganisms. Here, we analyzed over forty Saccharomycetaceae yeasts, covering over 200 million years of the evolutionary history, for their carbon metabolism. The experiments were done under strictly controlled and uniform conditions, which has not been done before. We show that the origin of Crabtree effect in Saccharomycetaceae predates the whole genome duplication and became a settled metabolic trait after the split of the S. cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lineages, and coincided with the origin of modern fruit bearing plants. Our results suggest that ethanol fermentation evolved progressively, involving several successive molecular events that have gradually remodeled the yeast carbon metabolism.

Pyruvate loses carbon dioxide to produce acetaldehyde, which is reduced by alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (Adh1) to ethanol, which accumulates. Yeast later consumes the accumulated ethanol, exploiting Adh2, an Adh1 homolog differing by 24 (of 348) amino acids. As many microorganisms cannot grow in ethanol, accumulated ethanol may help yeast defend resources in the fruit. We report here the resurrection of the last common ancestor of Adh1 and Adh2, called AdhA. The kinetic behavior of AdhA suggests that the ancestor was optimized to make (not consume) ethanol. This is consistent with the hypothesis that before the Adh1-Adh2 duplication, yeast did not accumulate ethanol for later consumption but rather used AdhA to recycle NADH generated in the glycolytic pathway. Silent nucleotide dating suggests that the Adh1-Adh2 duplication occurred near the time of duplication of several other proteins involved in the accumulation of ethanol, possibly in the Cretaceous age when fleshy fruits arose. These results help to connect the chemical behavior of these enzymes through systems analysis to a time of global ecosystem change, a small but useful step towards a planetary systems biology.", "citingTitle": "Yeast \u201cMake-Accumulate-Consume\u201d Life Strategy Evolved as a Multi-Step Process That Predates the Whole Genome Duplication", "citedTitle": "Resurrecting ancestral alcohol dehydrogenases from yeast"}

Tissue factor (TF) is the initiator of the coagulation cascade. Monocytes do not normally express TF, but can be induced to do so by certain stimuli. Aberrant TF expression is important in the thrombotic complications of bacterial sepsis, certain malignancies and coronary artery disease (CAD). In this thesis, regulation of monocyte TF by cytokines and by interactions with other vascular cells were studied, as well as the activation of blood cells, inflammation and coagulation in CAD patients and the association of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 with prognosis in unstable CAD. In a whole blood experimental system, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was shown to suppress lipopolysaccharide-induced TF expression in monocytes, whereas IL-4 and IL-13 did not, contrary to previous in vitro findings. Activated platelets also induced monocyte TF in whole blood in a P-selectin-dependent manner, causing a rapid surface exposure of TF independent of mRNA formation. The differentiated monocytic cell line U-937 displayed different kinetics of platelet-stimulated TF induction. In co-culture with cytokine-activated human coronary artery endothelial cells, U-937 cells expressed TF, and also IL-6. The endothelial cells up-regulated their production of IL10. Simvastatin, enalapril and dalteparin, all commonly used drugs in CAD treatment, suppressed TF induction but did not alter cytokine expression in co-cultures. In unstable CAD, there was an activation of both coagulation and inflammation compared to stable CAD that coincided with an increased activation of platelets and leukocytes. Women had different patterns of cellular activation than men, indicating differences in pathogenetic mechanisms. Plasma levels of IL-6 above 5 ng/L proved to be a strong, independent marker for increased risk of death in a 6-12 month perspective in patients with unstable CAD. This risk was significantly reduced by an early invasive strategy.", "citedAbstract": "Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) has been characterized as an atherogenic molecule responsible for the induction of a variety of gene products. One such gene, tissue factor (TF), the cellular initiator of the coagulation cascade, is not expressed in normal vascular tissue but is expressed by monocytes and foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, we examined the effect of oxLDL on TF expression in cultured human adherent monocytes. Endotoxin-free oxLDL alone did not induce TF expression in adherent monocytes. However, oxLDL significantly enhanced TF expression induced by the inflammatory mediator, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In contrast, oxLDL did not alter LPS-mediated production of interleukin-8 and actually inhibited LPS-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, suggesting that some aspects of the signaling pathways for TF induction differ from those of other LPS-responsive monocyte/macrophage gene products. Thus, this study documents specific modulation of the expression of LPS-inducible genes in monocytic cells by oxLDL.

The opposing effects of bulbectomy and imipramine treatment in the hippocampus and amygdala demonstrate that these structures of the limbic system, both integrated in emotional processing, react quite differently with regard to neuroplasticity.

A reduction in the number of granule cells during sensory deprivation suggests that neurogenesis may be influenced by afferent activity. Here, we show that unilateral sensory deafferentation of the MOB by axotomy of the olfactory receptor neurons increases apoptotic cell death in the SVZ and along the rostro-caudal extent of the RMS. The vast majority of dying cells in the RMS are migrating neuroblasts as indicated by double Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick-end labeling/PSA-NCAM labeling.

Young males rearing enlarged broods showed a stronger increase in plumage darkness from the current to the next breeding season than those rearing reduced or control broods.

Determining the variability of spike timing can provide fundamental insights into the nature of strategies used in the brain to represent and transmit information in the form of discrete spike trains. In this study, we employ a signal estimation paradigm to determine how variability in spike timing affects encoding of random time-varying signals. We assess this for two types of spiking models: an integrate-and-fire model with random threshold and a more biophysically realistic stochastic ion channel model. Using the coding fraction and mutual information as information-theoretic measures, we quantify the efficacy of optimal linear decoding of random inputs from the model outputs and study the relationship between efficacy and variability in the output spike train. Our findings suggest that variability does not necessarily hinder signal decoding for the biophysically plausible encoders examined and that the functional role of spiking variability depends intimately on the nature of the encoder and the signal processing task; variability can either enhance or impede decoding performance.", "citedAbstract": "Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a \u201chigh-input regime\u201d in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50\u2013100 neurons. These column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10\u201350 msec). Finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons\u2014that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources.", "citingTitle": "The Impact of Spike Timing Variability on the Signal-Encoding Performance of Neural Spiking Models", "citedTitle": "The Variable Discharge of Cortical Neurons: Implications for Connectivity, Computation, and Information Coding"}

This study developed a novel flume to characterize swimming behavior of barnacle cyprids in a laboratory downwelling flow. Seawater was pumped through a cylindrical observation chamber fitted with diffusers to produce a homogeneous down- welling velocity field. The flume generated plug flow with mean downwelling velocities (indicated by negative sign) of 0 to -47.3 mm s -1 . Behavior experiments were done with wild Semibalanus bal- anoides cyprids. Vertical swimming rates and behaviors were estimated from video observations, and a mixture model was used to estimate velocity distributions for distinct behavioral modes. Larvae exhibited multiple behaviors but typically swam upward in response to downwelling, with a maxi- mum estimated vertical velocity of 72.3 mm s -1 . When faced with downwelling flows, cyprids alter- nated between upward swimming and downward swimming to maintain their vertical position in the chamber. As downwelling velocities increased, cyprids that remained in the field of view of the cam- eras exhibited faster mean upward swimming velocities. It is unclear how long individual S. bal- anoides cyprids can maintain depth, but cyprids were able to maintain depth throughout the 2 min observation period. This study supports earlier hypotheses based on field observations by demon- strating that S. balanoides cyprids swim well enough to counter downwelling velocities characteris- tic of convergence zones. Swimming against downwelling flow could be an adaptive behavior that enables shoreward transport in the absence of any larval ability to swim toward shore or even to sense its direction.", "citedAbstract": "Field observations imply that accumulation and advection of invertebrate larvae and other plankton by propagating fronts provides an efficient mechanism for the cross-shelf transport and subsequent coastal settlement of larvae and plankton. Gravity currents propagating into a heavier, uniform-density fluid are known to have near-surface velocities u that exceed the propagation speed c of the gravity current nose. It is shown by simple dam-break laboratory experiments and through corresponding numerical solutions of two-dimensional stratified flow and Lagrangian particle advection that this characteristic of gravity currents can lead to accumulation in the gravity current nose of particles that originate well behind the gravity current head. However, efficient particle accumulation and transport with the speed c only occurs for particles with sufficient vertical buoyancy or vertical swimming capability. Weakly buoyant or neutral particles are swept down and back away from the gravity current head by the circulation in this region. A dam break into an ambient fluid with stratification (two-layered) could result in the transport of some particles that are initially trapped in the forepart of the leading disturbance, an undular bore. However, this situation does not result in significant accumulation of particles at the leading edge of the disturbance. The numerical solutions show that particles that originate in the dense fluid ahead of the gravity current are much less likely to be accumulated at the gravity current nose. A simple scaling criterion for the minimum vertical buoyancy velocity for efficient accumulation and transport of buoyant particles based on the gravity current and particle characteristics is developed and compares favorably with the numerical results. The implications of these results for transport of larvae in coastal environments are discussed. The dynamics of marine benthic invertebrate populations are greatly affected by larval transport. For near-shore populations, larval transport prior to settlement includes at least three processes: cross-shore advection, because larvae are generally very small and cannot control their cross-shore position by swimming alone; larval behavior, because by swimming vertically, larvae might be able to exploit some depth-dependent cross-shore flows; and accumulation by convergent circulation in propagating features, because cross-shore advection of larvae is often dependent on the retention of larvae at the propagating features. Several hypotheses of onshore larval transport, namely surface slicks over linear internal waves (Shanks 1983), internal bore warm fronts (Pineda 1994), and upwelling relaxation fronts (Farrell et al. 1991), invoke concentration of larvae at propagating features. These hypotheses state that larvae become concentrated at convergent features aligned parallel to the coastline and that larval transport occurs as these linear features propagate shoreward. The interplay between transport and accumulation is poorly understood; issues include (1) the dependency of transport on accumulation, and of accumulation on larval behavior, and (2) whether the frontal larvae originate onshore or off", "citingTitle": "Swimming behavior and velocities of barnacle cyprids in a downwelling flume", "citedTitle": "Accumulation of particles in propagating fronts"}

Serotonin (5-HT) plays an important role in attenuating these effects of NMDA-RA.ResultsSelective 5-HT2A inverse agonists, e.g., M100907 and ACP-103, and atypical APDs, which are more potent 5-HT2A than D2 antagonists, e.g., clozapine and lurasidone, are more effective than selective D2 receptor antagonists to attenuate NMDA-RA-induced increased LA. 5-HT2A inverse agonists alone are not effective to improve NMDA-RA-impaired NOR, but augment the effects of atypical, but not typical APDs, to improve NOR. The 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist tandospirone alone and the 5-HT1A agonist effects of atypical APDs may substitute for, or contribute to, the effects of D2 and 5-HT2A receptor antagonism to reverse the NMDA-RA impairment in NOR. 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptor antagonists may also attenuate these NMDA-RA-induced behaviors. 5-HT2C receptor inverse agonist, but not neutral antagonists, block NOR in na\u00efve rats and the effects of atypical APDs to restore NOR in PCP-treated rats, suggesting the importance of the constitutive activity of 5-HT2C receptors in NOR.ConclusionsMultiple 5-HT receptors contribute to effective treatments to reverse adverse effects of NMDA-RA which model psychosis and cognitive impairment.", "citedAbstract": "Rationale5-HT receptor mechanisms have been suggested to mediate improvements in cognition in schizophrenia.AimThe aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of 5-HT receptor mechanisms in sub-chronic phencyclidine (PCP)-induced reversal learning deficits in female rats, a task of relevance to schizophrenia.MethodsAdult female hooded Lister rats were trained to perform an operant reversal learning task and then received sub-chronic PCP (2\u00a0mg/kg) or vehicle intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice daily for 7\u00a0days, followed by 7-day washout.

Activation of JNK involves redox-sensitive mechanisms and physiological stimuli such as shear stress, the dragging force generated by blood flow over the endothelium. Laminar shear stress has antiatherogenic properties and controls structure and function of endothelial cells by mechanisms including production of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide ([Formula: see text]). Here we show that both NO and [Formula: see text] are required for activation of JNK by shear stress in endothelial cells. The present study also demonstrates that exposure of endothelial cells to shear stress increases tyrosine nitration, a marker of reactive nitrogen species formation. Furthermore, inhibitors or scavengers of NO, [Formula: see text], or reactive nitrogen species prevented shear-dependent increase in tyrosine nitration and activation of JNK. Peroxynitrite alone, added to cells as a bolus or generated over 60 min by 3-morpholinosydnonimine, also activates JNK.

Here we show, using bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), that shear stress differentially regulates ERK and JNK by mechanisms involving Gi2 and pertussis toxin (PTx)-insensitive G-protein-dependent pathways, respectively. Shear activated ERK with a rapid, biphasic time course (maximum by 5 min and basal by 30-min shear exposure) and force dependence (minimum and maximum at 1 and 10 dyn/cm2 shear stress, respectively). PTx treatment prevented shear-dependent activation of ERK1/2, consistent with a Gi-dependent mechanism. In contrast, JNK activity was maximally turned on by a threshold level of shear force (0.5 dyn/cm2 or higher) with a much slower and prolonged time course (requiring at least 30 min to 4 h) than that of ERK. Also, PTx had no effect on shear-dependent activation of JNK. To further define the shear-sensitive ERK and JNK pathways, vectors expressing hemagglutinin epitope-tagged ERK (HA-ERK) or HA-JNK were co-transfected with other vectors by using adenovirus-polylysine in BAEC. Expression of the mutant \u03b1i2(G203), antisense G\u03b1i2 and a dominant negative Ras (N17Ras) prevented shear-dependent activation of HA-ERK, while that of \u03b1i2(G204) and antisense \u03b1i3 did not.

Methodology We performed a cross-sectional study involving 114 children aged 6\u201315 years in six neighborhoods in Azagui\u00e9 Ahoua, south C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to characterize the sensitivity and specificity of the POC-CCA cassette test with urine samples that were tested individually and in pools of 4, 8, and 12. We used a Bayesian latent class model to estimate test characteristics for individual POC-CCA and quadruplicate Kato-Katz thick smears on stool samples. We then developed a microsimulation model and used lot quality assurance sampling to test the performance, number of tests, and total cost per school for each pooled testing strategy to predict the binary need for school-based preventive chemotherapy using a 10% prevalence threshold for treatment. Principal Findings The sensitivity of the urine pooling strategy for S. mansoni diagnosis using pool sizes of 4, 8, and 12 was 85.9%, 79.5%, and 65.4%, respectively, when POC-CCA trace results were considered positive, and 61.5%, 47.4%, and 30.8% when POC-CCA trace results were considered negative. The modeled specificity ranged from 94.0\u201397.7% for the urine pooling strategies (when POC-CCA trace results were considered negative). The urine pooling strategy, regardless of the pool size, gave comparable and often superior classification performance to stool microscopy for the same number of tests.

Here, we aimed to determine if the subcortical response to a complex auditory stimulus is encoded differently between the sexes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing electrophysiological techniques, we assessed the auditory brainstem response to a synthesized stop-consonant speech syllable [da] in 76 native-English speaking, young adults (38 female). Timing and frequency components of the response were compared between males and females to determine which aspects of the response are affected by sex.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA dissimilarity between males and females was seen in the neural response to the components of the speech stimulus that change rapidly over time; but not in the slower changing, lower frequency information in the stimulus. We demonstrate that, in agreement with the click-evoked brainstem response, females have earlier peaks relative to males in the subcomponents of the response representing the onset of the speech sound. In contrast, the response peaks comprising the frequency-following response, which encode the fundamental frequency (F(0)) of the stimulus, as well as the spectral amplitude of the response to the F(0), is not affected by sex. Notably, the higher-frequency elements of the speech syllable are encoded differently between males and females, with females having greater representation of spectrotemporal information for frequencies above the F(0).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results provide a baseline for interpreting the higher incidence of language impairment (e.g. dyslexia, autism, specific language impairment) in males, and the subcortical deficits associated with these disorders.\n\n\nSIGNIFICANCE\nThese results parallel the subcortical encoding patterns that are documented for good and poor readers in that poor readers differ from good readers on encoding fast but not slow components of speech.

Strong, converse effects are seen from the two agents, the most consistent being on the sizes of new dorsalised areas (second neural plates) induced in host epiblast. Follistatin also enhances extension movements due to grafts, though without clear effect upon the rostro-caudal completeness of new patterns. Neural induction in chick epiblast by grafted mouse nodes are also more extensive, after their pre-incubation in Follistatin. Follistatin potentiates other, unknown but distinctive signals coming from the node, being unable to convert other non-inducing pieces of blastoderm into organisers on grafting.

Most aspects of this syndrome can be understood as due to attenuation of dorsalising and neural-inducing signals during gastrulation, followed by failure to maintain the later signals from chordamesoderm/neural midline that pattern the mesodermal and neural cross sections during subsequent stages. Anatomical effects are first apparent at early neurula stages and correspond with what might be expected from a reduced counteraction of the ventralising Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway at the earlier stages, coupled with inadequate Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling subsequently. Delay in the clearing of BMP-4 RNA expression from the presumptive neural region at gastrulation is indeed seen, though chordin RNA expression within organiser derivatives remains normal. Subsequently, specific attenuation of chordamesoderm and neural midline Shh expression is observed. Brief preincubation of stage 4 chick blastoderms in supernatant from Xenopus oocytes that have been injected with Flik RNA prolongs and enhances the competence of their peripheral epiblast to respond to neural inductive signals from grafted Hensen's nodes.

By combining these methods, we have been able to eliminate the most significant sources of potential errors inherent to each of these approaches. The structural model is based on the crystal structure of human isoform 2. In the QM/MM method, the QM region consists of 275 atoms, the remaining 5776 atoms were in the MM region. We found that ppGalNAcT2 catalyzes a same-face nucleophilic substitution with internal return (SNi). The optimized transition state for the reaction is 13.8 kcal/mol higher in energy than the reactant while the energy of the product complex is 6.7 kcal/mol lower. During the process of nucleophilic attack, a proton is synchronously transferred to the leaving phosphate. The presence of a short-lived metastable oxocarbenium intermediate is likely, as indicated by the reaction energy profiles obtained using high-level density functionals.", "citedAbstract": "We present the theoretical and technical foundations of the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) program with a survey of the characteristics of the code (numerical integration, density fitting for the Coulomb potential, and STO basis functions).

Design: Prospective experimental study comparing ENG, ABR, and TCD battery findings between two groups of patients with vertigo and a control group. Study sample: Participants included 14 patients with vertigo of VBI origin, 14 patients with vertigo of non-VBI, and 11 matched controls. Results: Participants with VBI had more abnormal findings in the ENG (86%), TCD (72%), and ABR (64%) compared to the non-VBI group (64%, 21%, and 7%, respectively) and the control group. The combined battery revealed positive correlations, 64% sensitivity, and 84% positive predictive value (PPV) in the VBI group, and 100% specificity with lack of correlations in the non-VBI group.

In this study, we identified a putative protein phosphatase gene CPP1 in F. verticillioides, and investigated its role in FB(1) regulation. Previous work has shown that CPP1 expression is elevated in an FB(1)-suppressing genetic background. Thus, we hypothesized that CPP1 is negatively associated with FB(1) production. To test this hypothesis, we generated a CPP1 knockout mutant, PP179, and studied the effects of gene deletion on FB(1) biosynthesis and fungal development. PP179 showed elevated expression of FUM genes, and in turn produced higher levels of FB(1) than the wild-type progenitor. Other significant mutant phenotypes included reduced radial growth on agar plates, reduced conidia germination rates, significantly increased macroconidia formation, and hyphal swelling. To verify that these phenotypes were directly due to CPP1 deletion, we complemented PP179 with the wild-type CPP1 gene. The complemented strain PPC4 showed FUM1 expression and FB(1) production similar to that of the wild-type, providing evidence that CPP1 is negatively associated with FB(1) biosynthesis. Other PP179 phenotypes, such as macroconidiation and hyphal swelling, were also restored to that of wild-type progenitor. Furthermore, we complemented F. verticillioides PP179 strain with Neurospora crassa wild-type ppe-1 gene, demonstrating that Cpp1 and PPE-1 proteins are functionally conserved. Pleiotropic effects of CPP1 deletion led us to hypothesize that CPP1 is associated with multiple downstream signalling pathways in F. verticillioides.

In contrast, a/alpha cells typically bud in a bipolar pattern, in which new buds can form at either pole of the cell. The BUD3 gene is specifically required for the axial pattern of budding: mutations of BUD3 (including a deletion) affect the axial pattern but not the bipolar pattern. The sequence of BUD3 predicts a product (Bud3p) of 1635 amino acids with no strong or instructive similarities to previously known proteins. However, immunofluorescence localization of Bud3p has revealed that it assembles in an apparent double ring encircling the mother-bud neck shortly after the mitotic spindle forms. The Bud3p structure at the neck persists until cytokinesis, when it splits to yield a single ring of Bud3p marking the division site on each of the two progeny cells. These single rings remain for much of the ensuing unbudded phase and then disassemble. The Bud3p rings are indistinguishable from those of the neck filament- associated proteins (Cdc3p, Cdc10p, Cdc11p, and Cdc12p), except that the latter proteins assemble before bud emergence and remain in place for the duration of the cell cycle. Upon shift of a temperature- sensitive cdc12 mutant to restrictive temperature, localization of both Bud3p and the neck filament-associated proteins is rapidly lost. In addition, a haploid cdc11 mutant loses its axial-budding pattern upon shift to restrictive temperature. Taken together, the data suggest that Bud3p and the neck filaments are linked in a cycle in which each controls the position of the other's assembly: Bud3p assembles onto the neck filaments in one cell cycle to mark the site for axial budding (including assembly of the new ring of neck filaments) in the next cell cycle. As the expression and localization of Bud3p are similar in a, alpha, and a/alpha cells, additional regulation must exist such that Bud3p restricts the position of bud formation in a and alpha cells but not in a/alpha cells.", "citingTitle": "Functional characterization of Fusarium verticillioides CPP1, a gene encoding a putative protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit.", "citedTitle": "Role of Bud3p in producing the axial budding pattern of yeast"}

Despite intense interest in the mechanisms underlying cavitation and its negative impact on treatment outcomes, there has been limited study of this phenomenon, owing in large part to the limitations of existing animal models. Although cavitation does not occur in conventional mouse strains after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, cavitary lung lesions have occasionally been observed in C3HeB/FeJ mice. However, to date, there has been no demonstration that cavitation can be produced consistently enough to support C3HeB/FeJ mice as a new and useful model of cavitary TB. We utilized serial computed tomography (CT) imaging to detect pulmonary cavitation in C3HeB/FeJ mice after aerosol infection with M. tuberculosis. Post-mortem analyses were performed to characterize lung lesions and to localize matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) previously implicated in cavitary TB in situ. A total of 47-61% of infected mice developed cavities during primary disease or relapse after non-curative treatments. Key pathological features of human TB, including simultaneous presence of multiple pathologies, were noted in lung tissues. Optical imaging demonstrated increased MMP activity in TB lesions and MMP-9 was significantly expressed in cavitary lesions. Tissue MMP-9 activity could be abrogated by specific inhibitors. In situ, three-dimensional analyses of cavitary lesions demonstrated that 22.06% of CD11b+ signal colocalized with MMP-9. C3HeB/FeJ mice represent a reliable, economical and tractable model of cavitary TB, with key similarities to human TB. This model should provide an excellent tool to better understand the pathogenesis of cavitation and its effects on TB treatments.

Cavitary pathology contributes to antibiotic failure, transmission, morbidity and mortality. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), in particular MMP\u20101, are implicated in TB pathogenesis. We explored the mechanisms relating MMP/TIMP imbalance to cavity formation in a modified rabbit model of cavitary TB. Our model resulted in consistent progression of consolidation to human\u2010like cavities (100% by day 28), with resultant bacillary burdens (>107 CFU/g) far greater than those found in matched granulomatous tissue (105 CFU/g). Using a novel, breath\u2010hold computed tomography (CT) scanning and image analysis protocol, we showed that cavities developed rapidly from areas of densely consolidated tissue. Radiological change correlated with a decrease in functional lung tissue, as estimated by changes in lung density during controlled pulmonary expansion (R2\u2009=\u20090.6356, p < 0.0001). We demonstrated that the expression of interstitial collagenase (MMP\u20101) was specifically greater in cavitary compared to granulomatous lesions (p < 0.01), and that TIMP\u20103 significantly decreased at the cavity surface. Our findings demonstrated that an MMP\u20101/TIMP imbalance is associated with the progression of consolidated regions to cavities containing very high bacterial burdens. Our model provided mechanistic insight, correlating with human disease at the pathological, microbiological and molecular levels. It also provided a strategy to investigate therapeutics in the context of complex TB pathology. We used these findings to predict a MMP/TIMP balance in active TB and confirmed this in human plasma, revealing the potential of MMP/TIMP levels as key components of a diagnostic matrix aimed at distinguishing active from latent TB (PPV = 92.9%, 95% CI 66.1\u201399.8%, NPV = 85.6%; 95% CI 77.0\u201391.9%).

To understand the effect of efforts to improve quality and efficiency of care in CAP, we examined the trends in mortality and costs among hospitalized CAP patients. Methods:Using the National Inpatient Sample between 1993 and 2005, we studied 569,524 CAP admissions. The primary outcome was mortality at discharge. We used logistic regression to evaluate the mortality trend, adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities. To account for the effect of early discharge practices, we also compared daily mortality rates and performed a Cox proportional hazards model. We used a generalized linear model to analyze trends in hospitalization costs, which were derived using cost-to-charge ratios. Results:Over time, length of stay declined, while more patients were discharged to other facilities. The frequency of many comorbidities increased. Age/gender-adjusted mortality decreased from 8.9% to 4.1% (P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, the mortality risk declined through 2005 (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.48\u20130.53), compared with the reference year 1993. The daily mortality rates demonstrated that most of the mortality reduction occurred early during hospitalization. After adjusting for early discharge practices, the risk of mortality still declined through 2005 (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70\u20130.78). Median hospitalization costs exhibited a moderate reduction over time, mostly because of reduced length of stay. Conclusions:Mortality among patients hospitalized for CAP has declined. Lower in-hospital mortality at a reduced cost suggests that pneumonia is a case of improved productivity in health care.", "citedAbstract": "PURPOSE\nTo assess the variation in length of stay for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia and to determine whether patients who are treated in hospitals with shorter mean stays have worse medical outcomes.\n\n\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nWe prospectively studied a cohort of 1,188 adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia who had been admitted to one community and three university teaching hospitals. We compared patients' mean length of stay, mortality, hospital readmission, return to usual activities, return to work, and pneumonia-related symptoms among the four study hospitals. All outcomes were adjusted for baseline differences in severity of illness and comorbidity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAdjusted interhospital differences in mean length of stay ranged from 0.9 to 2.3 days (P <0.001). When the risk of each medical outcome was compared between patients admitted to the hospital with the shortest length of stay and those admitted to longer stay hospitals, there were no differences in mortality [relative risk (RR) = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.7], hospital readmission (RR = 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.2), return to usual activities (RR = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.3), or return to work (RR = 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8 to 2.0) during the first 14 days after discharge, or in the mean number of pneumonia-related symptoms 30 days after admission (P = 0.54).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe observed substantial interhospital variation in the lengths of stay for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. The finding that medical outcomes were similar in patients admitted to the hospital with the shortest length of stay and those admitted to hospitals with longer mean lengths of stay suggests that hospitals with longer stays may be able to reduce the mean duration of hospitalization for this disease without adversely affecting patient outcomes.", "citingTitle": "Trends in Mortality and Medical Spending in Patients Hospitalized for Community-Acquired Pneumonia: 1993\u20132005", "citedTitle": "Variation in length of hospital stay in patients with community-acquired pneumonia: are shorter stays associated with worse medical outcomes?"}

Methods Literature on children's active commuting to school published before June 2007 was compiled by searching PubMed, PsycINFO, and the National Transportation Library databases; conducting Internet searches on program-based activities; and reviewing relevant transportation journals published during the last 4 years. Results Children who walk or bicycle to school have higher daily levels of physical activity and better cardiovascular fitness than do children who do not actively commute to school. A wide range of predictors of children's active commuting behaviors was identified, including demographic factors, individual and family factors, school factors (including the immediate area surrounding schools), and social and physical environmental factors. Safe Routes to School and the Walking School Bus are 2 public health efforts that promote walking and bicycling to school. Although evaluations of these programs are limited, evidence exists that these activities are viewed positively by key stakeholders and have positive effects on children's active commuting to school.

This paper presents an agent-based occupancy simulator, which models each occupant as an agent with specified movement events and statistics of space uses. To reduce the amount of data inputs, the simulator allows users to group occupants with similar behaviors as an occupant type, and spaces with similar function as a space type. It is a web-based application with friendly graphical user interface, cloud computing, and data storage. A case study is presented to demonstrate the usage of the occupancy simulator and its integration with EnergyPlus and obFMU. It first shows the required data inputs and the results from the occupancy simulator. Then, the generated occupant schedules are used in the EnergyPlus and obFMU simulation to evaluate the impacts of occupant behavior on building energy performance. The simulation results indicate that the occupancy simulator can capture the diversity of space\u2019s occupancy behavior rather than the static weekly profiles, and can generate realistic occupancy schedules to support building performance simulation.", "citedAbstract": "Building occupancy is an important basic factor in building energy simulation but it is hard to represent due to its temporal and spatial stochastic nature. This paper presents a novel approach for building occupancy simulation based on the Markov chain. In this study, occupancy is handled as the straightforward result of occupant movement processes which occur among the spaces inside and outside a building. By using the Markov chain method to simulate this stochastic movement process, the model can generate the location for each occupant and the zone-level occupancy for the whole building. There is no explicit or implicit constraint to the number of occupants and the number of zones in the model while maintaining a simple and clear set of input parameters. From the case study of an office building, it can be seen that the model can produce realistic occupancy variations in the office building for a typical workday with key statistical properties of occupancy such as the time of morning arrival and night departure, lunch time, periods of intermediate walking-around, etc. Due to simplicity, accuracy and unrestraint, this model is sufficient and practical to simulate occupancy for building energy simulations and stochastic analysis of building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.", "citingTitle": "An Agent-Based Occupancy Simulator for Building Performance Simulation:", "citedTitle": "A novel approach for building occupancy simulation"}

However, the specific compounds that confer the effects of essential oils and the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. TRPM8 is a thermosensitive receptor that detects cool temperatures and menthol whereas TRPA1 is a sensor of noxious cold. Ideally, an effective analgesic compound would activate TRPM8 and inhibit TRPA1.ResultsWe screened essential oils and fragrance chemicals showing a high ratio of human TRPM8-activating ability versus human TRPA1-activating ability using a Ca2+-imaging method, and identified 1,8-cineole in eucalyptus oil as particularly effective. Patch-clamp experiments confirmed that 1,8-cineole evoked inward currents in HEK293T cells expressing human TRPM8, but not human TRPA1. In addition, 1,8-cineole inhibited human TRPA1 currents activated by allyl isothiocyanate, menthol, fulfenamic acid or octanol in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in vivo sensory irritation tests showed that 1,8-cineole conferred an analgesic effect on sensory irritation produced by TRPA1 agonists octanol and menthol. Surprisingly, 1,4-cineole, which is structurally similar and also present in eucalyptus oil, activated both human TRPM8 and human TRPA1.Conclusions1,8-cineole is a rare natural antagonist of human TRPA1 that has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects possibly due to its inhibition of TRPA1.", "citedAbstract": "Camphor is a naturally occurring compound that is used as a major active ingredient of balms and liniments supplied as topical analgesics. Despite its long history of common medical use, the underlying molecular mechanism of camphor action is not understood. Capsaicin and menthol, two other topically applied agents widely used for similar purposes, are known to excite and desensitize sensory nerves by acting on two members of transient receptor potential (TRP) channel superfamily: heat-sensitive TRP vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) and cold-sensitive TRP channel M8, respectively. Camphor has recently been shown to activate TRPV3, and here we show that camphor also activates heterologously expressed TRPV1, requiring higher concentrations than capsaicin. Activation was enhanced by phospholipase C-coupled receptor stimulation mimicking inflamed conditions. Similar camphor-activated TRPV1-like currents were observed in isolated rat DRG neurons and were strongly potentiated after activation of protein kinase C with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. Camphor activation of rat TRPV1 was mediated by distinct channel regions from capsaicin, as indicated by camphor activation in the presence of the competitive inhibitor capsazepine and in a capsaicin-insensitive point mutant. Camphor did not activate the capsaicin-insensitive chicken TRPV1. TRPV1 desensitization is believed to contribute to the analgesic actions of capsaicin. We found that, although camphor activates TRPV1 less effectively, camphor application desensitized TRPV1 more rapidly and completely than capsaicin. Conversely, TRPV3 current sensitized after repeated camphor applications, which is inconsistent with the analgesic role of camphor. We also found that camphor inhibited several other related TRP channels, including ankyrin-repeat TRP 1 (TRPA1). The camphor-induced desensitization of TRPV1 and block of TRPA1 may underlie the analgesic effects of camphor.", "citingTitle": "1,8-cineole, a TRPM8 agonist, is a novel natural antagonist of human TRPA1", "citedTitle": "Camphor Activates and Strongly Desensitizes the Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid Subtype 1 Channel in a Vanilloid-Independent Mechanism"}

Antibody isotypes differ in effector functions and are thought to play a defining role in elicitation of immune responses, both in natural infection and in vaccination.

The aim of this study was to determine the contribution and molecular mechanisms of TERT in the pathogenesis of PH. Approach and Results We measured the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and ventricular weight, analyzed morphometric change of the pulmonary vessels in the hypoxia or monocrotaline treated rats. Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, transwell assay and flow cytometry in pulmonary smooth muscle cells were performed to investigate the roles and relationship of TERT and 15-LO/15-HETE in PH. We revealed that the expression of TERT was increased in pulmonary vasculature of patients with PH and in the monocrotaline or hypoxia rat model of PH.

Insulin-induced changes in glucose oxidation (GLUox) and fatty acid (FA) oxidation (FAox) were measured in isolated hearts from control and diabetic mice, perfused with both low as well as high concentration of glucose and FA: 10 mM glucose/0.5 mM palmitate and 28 mM glucose/1.1 mM palmitate. Both in the absence and presence of insulin, diabetic hearts showed decreased rates of GLUox and elevated rates of FAox. However, the insulin-induced increment in GLUox, as well as the insulin-induced decrement in FAox, was similar or even more pronounced in diabetic that in control hearts. During elevated FA and glucose supply, however, the effect of insulin was blunted in db/db hearts with respect to both FAox and GLUox. Finally, insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose uptake was markedly reduced in isolated cardiomyocytes from db/db mice, whereas glucose uptake in isolated perfused db/db hearts was clearly responsive to insulin. These results show that, despite reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in isolated cardiomyocytes, isolated perfused db/db hearts are responsive to metabolic actions of insulin. These results should advocate the use of insulin therapy (glucose-insulin-potassium) in diabetic patients undergoing cardiac surgery or during reperfusion after an ischemic insult.", "citedAbstract": "The metabolic phenotype of hearts has been investigated using rodent models of type 2 diabetes which exhibit obesity and insulin resistance: db/db and ob/ob mice, and Zucker fatty and ZDF rats. In general, cardiac fatty acid (FA) utilization is enhanced in type 2 diabetic hearts, with increased rates of FA oxidation (db/db, ob/ob and ZDF models) and increased FA esterification into cellular triacylglycerols (db/db hearts). Hearts from db/db and ob/ob mice and ZDF rat hearts all have elevated levels of myocardial triacylglycerols, consistent with enhanced FA utilization. A number of mechanisms may be responsible for enhanced FA utilization in type 2 diabetic hearts: (i) increased FA uptake into cardiac myocytes and into mitochondria; (ii) altered mitochondrial function, with up-regulation of uncoupling proteins; and (iii) stimulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha. Enhanced cardiac FA utilization in rodent type 2 diabetic models is associated with reduced cardiac contractile function, perhaps as a consequence of lipotoxicity and/or reduced cardiac efficiency. Similar results have been obtained with human type 2 diabetic hearts, suggesting that pharmacological interventions that can reduce cardiac FA utilization may have beneficial effects on contractile function.", "citingTitle": "Perfused hearts from Type 2 diabetic (db/db) mice show metabolic responsiveness to insulin.", "citedTitle": "Fatty acid metabolism is enhanced in type 2 diabetic hearts."}

It is identified by its rapid, invasive progression with a profound resistance to treatments such as chemotherapy. Unfortunately, there is a lack of information on how to effectively inhibit and control the rapid growth of pancreatic tumors, as well as limited information for diagnostics. With current methods, pancreatic cancer will continue to prevail as a leading cause of cancer death. We propose to study the complexity of pancreatic tumors with a systematic and analytical approach. Cancer is an abnormal growth of tissue caused by uncontrolled cell division. Observing the growth of these cells would prove to have a good basis to monitor the growth of a tumor. Here we create a 3-D simulation of tumor growth through mathematical modeling, using data from pancreatic cells grown in vitro. Using 3-D models will help to understand pancreatic tumors at cellular and molecular levels. The project aims to observe realistic growth of the tumor, accomplished from growing tumor cells on a monolayer in order to find parameters for our 3D mathematical model. This method will prove more beneficial than testing only on a monolayer cell line. Although cell death and the toxicity of drug dosage can be tested using a cell monolayer alone, it does not meet the demands of testing drug delivery in a realistic tumor environment that the mathematical model would provide. The monolayer lacks the dimensions that the drug would have to travel if it were delivered to a real in vivo tumor. A possible continuation of this project in the future could be to utilize the mathematical based approach to predict optimal therapy for the pancreatic tumor in order to develop models that can better test patient care for tumors. Computer modeling, another stepping stone through mathematical modeling, will possibly lead to testing the toxic effects of drugs on a 3-D model through computer modeling will aid in understanding the delivery of drugs throughout the tumor in vivo.", "citedAbstract": "Abstract\u2002We study solid tumor (carcinoma) growth in the nonlinear regime using boundary-integral simulations. The tumor core is nonnecrotic and no inhibitor chemical species are present. A new formulation of the classical models [18,24,8,3] is developed and it is demonstrated that tumor evolution is described by a reduced set of two dimensionless parameters and is qualitatively unaffected by the number of spatial dimensions. One parameter describes the relative rate of mitosis to the relaxation mechanisms (cell mobility and cell-to-cell adhesion). The other describes the balance between apoptosis (programmed cell-death) and mitosis. Both parameters also include the effect of vascularization. Our analysis and nonlinear simulations reveal that the two new dimensionless groups uniquely subdivide tumor growth into three regimes associated with increasing degrees of vascularization: low (diffusion dominated, e.g., in vitro), moderate and high vascularization, that correspond to the regimes observed in vivo. We demonstrate that critical conditions exist for which the tumor evolves to nontrivial dormant states or grows self-similarly (i.e., shape invariant) in the first two regimes. This leads to the possibility of shape control and of controlling the release of tumor angiogenic factors by restricting the tumor volume-to-surface-area ratio. Away from these critical conditions, evolution may be unstable leading to invasive fingering into the external tissues and to topological transitions such as tumor breakup and reconnection. Interestingly we find that for highly vascularized tumors, while they grow unbounded, their shape always stays compact and invasive fingering does not occur. This is in agreement with recent experimental observations [30] of in vivo tumor growth, and suggests that the invasive growth of highly-vascularized tumors is associated to vascular and elastic anisotropies, which are not included in the model studied here.\n", "citingTitle": "Biomodeling of pancreatic tumor mass.", "citedTitle": "Nonlinear simulation of tumor growth"}

Based on these measurements, an aggregate is obtained. We take into account aspects such as transmission interference, limited, stochastic energy availability induced by the fact that the sensors harvest energy from the environment, limited transmission bandwidth. We analyze the retrieval time of measurements under centralized and decentralized sensor transmission schedules. The degree of difference between the two types of schedules, which we derive in this thesis, indicates the degree of improvement that distributed schedules can achieve. \n \nSecondly, we consider wireless caches, randomly deployed in the plane, that store a data file in a distributed manner. We provide an exact characterization of the Pareto front of two conflicting objectives concerning the cost of deploying the caches in the plane and the energy cost of retrieving the data file from these caches. We analyze the Pareto front under a partitioning and a network coding data caching strategy. Pareto dominance is proven for the network coding strategy. \n \nThirdly, we consider the case where sensed data is retrieved by querying either the sensor network or a central database. We formulate an optimal query processing strategy with respect to the response time of queries and the quality (freshness) of the query data.

We observed that the drag suit\u2013trained group exhibited a statistically significant decrease in distance per stoke while wearing the drag suit and the control group showed a significant increase in stroke rate and decrease in distance per stroke (in both suits). It is suggested to include some amounts of drag suit training in periods where swimming volume may decrease. Sets that are short in distance and performed at high intensity with sufficient rest to allow swimmers to maintain high stroke integrity should help athletes maintain techniques.

The purpose of the present study was to compare oral self-administration of phencyclidine (PCP) in female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) across different phases of the menstrual cycle. Since the 28-day menstrual cycle of non-human primates is similar to that of humans, this model could provide important evidence supporting the implication that changes in the levels of gonadal hormones across menstrual phase can alter a drug's reinforcing effects. Oral self-administration of several concentrations of PCP (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/ml) was examined in three sexually mature female monkeys during 3-h experimental sessions. Menstrual cycle phase was determined by onset of menses and verified by examining vaginal cytology. PCP self-administration was greater during the luteal phase at the 0.125 and 0.25 mg/ml concentrations, which is normally characterized by high levels of progesterone and moderate levels of estrogen, than during the follicular phase, when levels of estrogen are increasing and progesterone levels are low. When examined within each phase, numbers of PCP deliveries were highest during the mid-luteal phase, compared to the early and mid-follicular phases. No differences in self-administration were observed between early and mid-follicular phases, but a significant difference in PCP deliveries was found between mid- and late luteal phases at the lowest concentration of PCP tested.

The objective of this review was to assess current scientific evidence on the effectiveness of surgical interventions for degenerative lumbar spondylosis.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, Spine and ISSLS abstracts, with citation tracking from the retrieved articles. We also corresponded with experts. All data found up to 31 March 2004 are included.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nRandomised (RCTs) or quasi-randomised trials of surgical treatment of lumbar spondylosis.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published papers. Additional information was sought from the authors if necessary.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThirty-one published RCTs of all forms of surgical treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylosis were identified. The trials varied in quality: only the more recent trials used appropriate methods of randomization, blinding and independent assessment of outcome. Most of the earlier published results were of technical surgical outcomes with some crude ratings of clinical outcome. More of the recent trials also reported patient-centered outcomes of pain or disability, but there is still very little information on occupational outcomes. There was a particular lack of long term outcomes beyond two to three years. Seven heterogeneous trials on spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis and nerve compression permitted limited conclusions. Two new trials on the effectiveness of fusion showed conflicting results. One showed that fusion gave better clinical outcomes than conventional physiotherapy, while the other showed that fusion was no better than a modern exercise and rehabilitation programme. Eight trials showed that instrumented fusion produced a higher fusion rate (though that needs to be qualified by the difficulty of assessing fusion in the presence of metal-work), but did not improve clinical outcomes, while there is other evidence that it may be associated with higher complication rates. Three trials with conflicting results did not permit any conclusions about the relative effectiveness of anterior, posterior or circumferential fusion. Preliminary results of two small trials of intra-discal electrotherapy showed conflicting results. Preliminary data from three trials of disc arthroplasty did not permit any firm conclusions.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nLimited evidence is now available to support some aspects of surgical practice.

Here, we report that FGF23 exclusively activates FGFR4 on cardiac myocytes to stimulate phospholipase C\u03b3/calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T\u00a0cell signaling. A specific FGFR4-blocking antibody inhibits FGF23-induced hypertrophy of isolated cardiac myocytes and attenuates LVH in rats with CKD. Mice lacking FGFR4 do not develop LVH in response to elevated FGF23, whereas knockin mice carrying an FGFR4 gain-of-function mutation spontaneously develop LVH. Thus, FGF23 promotes LVH by activating FGFR4, thereby establishing FGFR4 as a pharmacological target for reducing cardiovascular risk in CKD.", "citedAbstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health epidemic that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an important mechanism of cardiovascular disease in individuals with CKD. Elevated levels of FGF23 have been linked to greater risks of LVH and mortality in patients with CKD, but whether these risks represent causal effects of FGF23 is unknown. Here, we report that elevated FGF23 levels are independently associated with LVH in a large, racially diverse CKD cohort. FGF23 caused pathological hypertrophy of isolated rat cardiomyocytes via FGF receptor-dependent activation of the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway, but this effect was independent of klotho, the coreceptor for FGF23 in the kidney and parathyroid glands. Intramyocardial or intravenous injection of FGF23 in wild-type mice resulted in LVH, and klotho-deficient mice demonstrated elevated FGF23 levels and LVH. In an established animal model of CKD, treatment with an FGF-receptor blocker attenuated LVH, although no change in blood pressure was observed. These results unveil a klotho-independent, causal role for FGF23 in the pathogenesis of LVH and suggest that chronically elevated FGF23 levels contribute directly to high rates of LVH and mortality in individuals with CKD.", "citingTitle": "Activation of Cardiac Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 Causes Left Ventricular Hypertrophy.", "citedTitle": "FGF23 induces left ventricular hypertrophy."}

Knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for oxalate absorption and secretion by the intestine therefore have significant implications for understanding the etiology of hyperoxaluria, as well as offering potential targets for future treatment strategies for calcium oxalate kidney stone disease. In this review, we present the recent developments and advances in this area over the past 10\u00a0years, and put to the test some of the new ideas that have emerged during this time, using human and mouse models. A key focus for our discussion are the membrane-bound anion exchangers, belonging to the SLC26 gene family, some of which have been shown to participate in transcellular oxalate absorption and secretion. This has offered the opportunity to not only examine the roles of these specific transporters, revealing their importance to oxalate homeostasis, but to also probe the relative contributions made by the active transcellular and passive paracellular components of oxalate transport across the intestine. We also discuss some of the various physiological stimuli and signaling pathways which have been suggested to participate in the adaptation and regulation of intestinal oxalate transport. Finally, we offer an update on research into Oxalobacter formigenes, alongside recent investigations of other oxalate-degrading gut bacteria, in both laboratory animals and humans.", "citedAbstract": "Active transcellular oxalate transport in the mammalian intestine contributes to the homeostasis of this important lithogenic anion. Several members of the Slc26a gene family of anion exchangers have a measurable oxalate affinity and are expressed along the gut, apically and basolaterally. Mouse Slc26a6 (PAT1) targets to the apical membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine, and its deletion results in net oxalate absorption and hyperoxaluria. Apical exchangers of the Slc26a family that mediate oxalate absorption have not been established, yet the Slc26a3 [downregulated in adenoma (DRA)] protein is a candidate mediator of oxalate uptake. We evaluated the role of DRA in intestinal oxalate and Cl(-) transport by comparing unidirectional and net ion fluxes across short-circuited segments of small (ileum) and large (cecum and distal colon) intestine from wild-type (WT) and DRA knockout (KO) mice. In WT mice, all segments demonstrated net oxalate and Cl(-) absorption to varying degrees. In KO mice, however, all segments exhibited net anion secretion, which was consistently, and solely, due to a significant reduction in the absorptive unidirectional fluxes. In KO mice, daily urinary oxalate excretion was reduced 66% compared with that in WT mice, while urinary creatinine excretion was unchanged. We conclude that DRA mediates a predominance of the apical uptake of oxalate and Cl(-) absorbed in the small and large intestine of mice under short-circuit conditions. The large reductions in urinary oxalate excretion underscore the importance of transcellular intestinal oxalate absorption, in general, and, more specifically, the importance of the DRA exchanger in oxalate homeostasis.", "citingTitle": "The role of intestinal oxalate transport in hyperoxaluria and the formation of kidney stones in animals and man", "citedTitle": "Transcellular oxalate and Cl- absorption in mouse intestine is mediated by the DRA anion exchanger Slc26a3, and DRA deletion decreases urinary oxalate."}

Results: A three-compartment, open PK model was the best fit using population PK analysis with NONMEM. Whole-body clearance (CL) was 0.58\u00a0l\u00a0kg\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 (95% CI 0.44\u20130.72) for reduced NAC (NACR) and 0.16 (0.13\u20130.20) l\u00a0kg\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 for total NAC (NACT).

Evolutionary dynamics of these genes is therefore essential in explaining patterns of evolutionary diversity. Among extant sarcopterygians comprising both lobe-finned fishes and tetrapods, our knowledge of the Hox genes and clusters has largely been restricted in several model organisms such as frogs, birds and mammals. Some evolutionary gaps still exist, especially for those groups with derived body morphology or occupying key positions on the tree of life, hindering our understanding of how Hox gene inventory varied along the sarcopterygian lineage.ResultsWe determined the Hox gene inventory for six sarcopterygian groups: lungfishes, caecilians, salamanders, snakes, turtles and crocodiles by comprehensive PCR survey and genome walking. Variable Hox genes in each of the six sarcopterygian group representatives, compared to the human Hox gene inventory, were further validated for their presence/absence by PCR survey in a number of related species representing a broad evolutionary coverage of the group. Turtles, crocodiles, birds and placental mammals possess the same 39 Hox genes. HoxD12 is absent in snakes, amphibians and probably lungfishes. HoxB13 is lost in frogs and caecilians. Lobe-finned fishes, amphibians and squamate reptiles possess HoxC3. HoxC1 is only present in caecilians and lobe-finned fishes. Similar to coelacanths, lungfishes also possess HoxA14, which is only found in lobe-finned fishes to date. Our Hox gene variation data favor the lungfish-tetrapod, turtle-archosaur and frog-salamander relationships and imply that the loss of HoxD12 is not directly related to digit reduction.ConclusionsOur newly determined Hox inventory data provide a more complete scenario for evolutionary dynamics of Hox genes along the sarcopterygian lineage. Limbless, worm-like caecilians and snakes possess similar Hox gene inventories to animals with less derived body morphology, suggesting changes to their body morphology are likely due to other modifications rather than changes to Hox gene numbers. Furthermore, our results provide basis for future sequencing of the entire Hox clusters of these animals.", "citedAbstract": "Hox genes code for transcription factors that play a major role in the development of all animal phyla. In invertebrates these genes usually occur as tightly linked cluster, with a few exceptions where the clusters have been dissolved. Only in vertebrates multiple clusters have been demonstrated which arose by duplication from a single ancestral cluster. This history of Hox cluster duplications, in particular during the early elaboration of the vertebrate body plan, is still poorly understood. In this paper we report the results of a PCR survey on genomic DNA of the pacific hagfish Eptatretus stoutii. Hagfishes are one of two clades of recent jawless fishes that are an offshoot of the early radiation of jawless vertebrates. Our data provide evidence for at least 33 distinct Hox genes in the hagfish genome, which is most compatible with the hypothesis of multiple Hox clusters. The largest number, seven, of distinct homeobox fragments could be assigned to paralog group 9, which could imply that the hagfish has more than four clusters. Quartet mapping reveals that within each paralog group the hagfish sequences are statistically more closely related to gnathostome Hox genes than with either amphioxus or lamprey genes. These results support two assumptions about the history of Hox genes: (1) The association of hagfish homeobox sequences with gnathostome sequences suggests that at least one Hox cluster duplication event happened in the stem of vertebrates, i.e., prior to the most recent common ancestor of jawed and jawless vertebrates. (2) The high number of paralog group 9 sequences in hagfish and the phylogenetic position of hagfish suggests that the hagfish lineage underwent additional independent Hox cluster/-gene duplication events.", "citingTitle": "A general scenario of Hox gene inventory variation among major sarcopterygian lineages", "citedTitle": "Evidence for independent Hox gene duplications in the hagfish lineage: a PCR-based gene inventory of Eptatretus stoutii."}

Previously, conflicting results have been reported regarding the relationship between contractile RFD and various physiological parameters. One reason for this discrepancy may be that RFD in various time intervals from the onset of contraction is affected by different physiological parameters. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between voluntary contractile RFD in time intervals of 0\u201310, 0\u201320,..., 0\u2013250\u00a0ms from the onset of contraction and two main parameters: (1) voluntary maximal muscle strength and (2) electrically evoked muscle twitch contractile properties. The main finding was that voluntary RFD became increasingly more dependent on MVC and less dependent on muscle twitch contractile properties as time from the onset of contraction increased. At time intervals later than 90\u00a0ms from the onset of contraction maximal muscle strength could account for 52\u201381% of the variance in voluntary RFD. In the very early time interval (<40\u00a0ms from the onset of contraction) voluntary RFD was moderately correlated to the twitch contractile properties of the muscle and was to a less extent related to MVC. The present results suggest that explosive movements with different time spans are influenced by different physiological parameters.

The pattern continues: each describes a component, none identifies the gestalt. There are a wealth of blue-light responses in higher plants. It is clear that many are biochemically, physiologically, or genetically independent, and others are linked. The mechanism by which a photon of blue light is converted into a biochemical signal and transduced into a biological response is under investigation for several of these responses. In many cases, investigators have successfully defined one or more components of the signaling mechanism.

However, recent data suggest that plants may have several nove1 signal carriers (Deng et al., 1992), and it is not certain that the paradigms will be transferable to plants. The majority of studies of signal carriers for blue-light responses in higher plants make use of standard biochemical tools: direct identification based on biochemical properties or antibody crossreactivity, or indirect identification based on inhibitor/activator studies.

An infrastructure management system acts as an infrastructure manager's 1) inspection database detailing the current state of the built infrastructure, 2) infrastructure performance simulation platform modeling the potential future infrastructure performance, 3) infrastructure deterioration and provided service estimator evaluating the equivalent financial loss associated with infrastructure deterioration and decreased provided levels of service, and 4) infrastructure maintenance action development engine formulating and scheduling technically and financially optimal infrastructure maintenance solutions. Historically, the performance simulation module of infrastructure management systems has focused primarily upon modeling gradual infrastructure deterioration processes, such as corrosion, and the infrastructure provided service estimator has employed nominal values for quantifying the public's evaluation of the provided infrastructure performance. These approaches have caused infrastructure managers to focus their attention and funding towards combating gradual infrastructure deterioration while giving priority maintenance status to infrastructure objects that place the largest nominally evaluated total performance impact on society. While this approach has helped infrastructure managers to more efficiently manage the built infrastructure, such an approach is only efficient if it is unfailingly implemented over multiple decades. Unfortunately, the current limited infrastructure management system scope has exposed infrastructure managers to two potentially disruptive forces \u2013 potential unforeseen natural hazard induced technical failures and potential political and/or financial funding support failures due to incongruent evaluation of the provided level of performance between the infrastructure manager's nominal evaluation measures and the experiencing society. While these two disruptive forces originate in two very different elements of an infrastructure management system, they both can induce the same result \u2013 undermining of the intended technically and financially optimal infrastructure management solution. Objective and originality To work towards rectifying both of these limitations, the current work has developed methodologies for both quantifying the long-term infrastructure natural hazard risk exposure and estimating an individual's experience-based evaluation of the provided level of infrastructure performance. The methodology for assessing natural hazard induced technical infrastructure failures has focused around developing an infrastructure component potential failure assessment procedure which employs data within existing infrastructure and transportation management systems and currently under development natural hazard identification maps. This failure assessment procedure is designed to identify the locations and estimate the associated consequences of potential natural hazard induced failures. This failure probability and failure consequence information is then employed to quantify an annualized and a multi-year infrastructure link risk exposure. The methodology for estimating an individual's experience-based evaluation of the provided level of infrastructure performance has been developed by employing research findings from the fields of psychology and behavioral economics to develop the affective assessment approach, a variance-based evaluation tool. This evaluation tool employs an individual's range and quality of experienced infrastructure performance in time to predict the individual's current induced affect and future sensitivity to the provided levels of infrastructure performance. As this is a constructed evaluation approach, employing the affective assessment approach directly in the third infrastructure management module, evaluating equivalent financial loss associated with decreased provided levels of service, can be computationally prohibitive as each potential sequence would need to be modeled. It is, therefore, proposed to use the affective assessment approach as a reality check against which the developed technically and financially optimal management solution can be assessed and solutions which provide too low or inconsistent levels of infrastructure performance can be identified, reevaluated or discarded. Results and benefits With this additional technical information and perspectives, infrastructure managers are able to actively consider an object's natural hazard risk exposure in modeling the infrastructure deterioration and in developing optimal maintenance actions. Furthermore, infrastructure managers are able to determine the annual funding that should be invested and made available to respond to current and future natural hazard induced object failures. By, calibrating and implanting the affective assessment approach, infrastructure managers can also study how proposed technically optimal solutions may be socially received and can select solutions which best maintain social support throughout the duration of the maintenance solution. Within the field of infrastructure management, the past 30 years has been invested in developing standardized and computerized infrastructure management systems. With these systems implemented, infrastructure managers are starting to observe their strengths but also their limitations. This work has focused on formulating quantitative methods to develop solutions for two of these limitations. It is hoped that these methods might be further developed, calibrated and implemented to improve existing infrastructure management systems and the infrastructure and society they manage.", "citedAbstract": "A fundamental requirement for effectively monitoring and operating transportation facilities is reliable, accurate data on traffic flow. The current state of the practice is to use networks of point detectors to gather information on traffic flow at fixed points on the roadway network. Traffic monitoring based on wireless location technology (WLT) offers an opportunity to expand the size of the transportation network being monitored at a lower cost than with point detection. In WLT-based monitoring, the locations of individual wireless devices are sampled anonymously. By tracking a series of positions for devices in vehicles, it is theoretically possible to estimate the average travel speed on a road. Although the concept of WLT-based monitoring is attractive, results have been mixed. Field tests have been successful at locating vehicle positions but have not been able to generate traffic information of the quality or reliability required for most applications. This research explored how WLT-based monitoring could be improved by rigorously examining the problem from a system design perspective. The evaluation focused on two measures of effectiveness: (1) the availability of speed estimates and (2) the accuracy of speed estimates. The performance of WLT-based monitoring systems was evaluated through a combination of controlled testing on simple networks and case studies on simulated real-world networks. Significant main effects and interactions were evaluated in a systematic manner using a test bed that combined microscopic traffic simulation and a model of a WLT-based monitoring system. The results revealed several important issues to be considered when designing and implementing a WLT-based monitoring system. The selection of parameters such as the number of vehicles tracked and frequency between readings needs to be tailored to handle localized traffic and geometric conditions. The results showed that well-designed monitoring systems could produce accurate results although there were some situations where performance could be improved. Guidelines for the design and use of WLT-based systems were generated, and future avenues to improve system performance were noted.", "citingTitle": "The responsive approach: an integrated socially-sustainable technically-optimal decision model", "citedTitle": "IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAFFIC MONITORING BASED ON WIRELESS LOCATION TECHNOLOGY"}

These findings demonstrate that regulation of gait variability and rhythmicity is apparently an automatic process that does not demand attention in healthy adults. In patients with PD, however, this ability becomes attention\u2010demanding and worsens when subjects perform secondary tasks.

The \nkey idea is to apply entity linking (EL) methods that identify mentions of KB entities in text, \nand then exploit the structured information within KGs. Developing entity-centric methods for \ntext understanding using KG exploration is the focus of this work. \n \nWe aim to show that structured background knowledge is a means for improving performance in \ndifferent IR and NLP tasks that traditionally only make use of the unstructured text input itself. \nThereby, the KB entities mentioned in text act as connection between the unstructured text and \nthe structured KG. We focus in particular on how to best leverage the knowledge as contained in \nsuch fully-structured (RDF) KGs like DBpedia with their labeled edges/predicates \u2013 which is in \ncontrast to previous work on Wikipedia-based approaches we build upon, which typically relies \non unlabeled graphs only. The contribution of this thesis can be structured along its three parts: \n \nIn Part I, we apply EL and semantify short text snippets with KB entities. While only retrieving \ntypes and categories from DBpedia for each entity, we are able to leverage this information \nto create semantically coherent clusters of text snippets. This pipeline of connecting text to \nbackground knowledge via the mentioned entities will be reused in all following chapters. \n \nIn Part II, we focus on semantic similarity and extend the idea of semantifying text with entities \nby proposing in Chapter 5 a model that represents whole documents by their entities. In this \nmodel, comparing documents semantically with each other is viewed as the task of comparing \nthe semantic relatedness of the respective entities, which we address in Chapter 4. We propose \nan unsupervised graph weighting schema and show that weighting the DBpedia KG leads to \nbetter results on an existing entity ranking dataset. The exploration of weighted KG paths turns \nout to be also useful when trying to disambiguate the entities from an open information extraction \n(OIE) system in Chapter 6. With this weighting schema, the integration of KG information \nfor computing semantic document similarity in Chapter 5 becomes the task of comparing the two \nKG subgraphs with each other, which we address by an approximate subgraph matching. Based \non a well-established evaluation dataset for semantic document similarity, we show that our unsupervised \nmethod achieves competitive performance similar to other state-of-the-art methods. \nOur results from this part indicate that KGs can contain helpful background knowledge, in particular \nwhen exploring KG paths, but that selecting the relevant parts of the graph is an important \nyet difficult challenge. \n \nIn Part III, we shift to the task of relevance ranking and first study in Chapter 7 how to best \nretrieve KB entities for a given keyword query. Combining again text with KB information, we \nextract entities from the top-k retrieved, query-specific documents and then link the documents \nto two different KBs, namely Wikipedia and DBpedia. In a learning-to-rank setting, we study \nextensively which features from the text, theWikipedia KB, and the DBpedia KG can be helpful \nfor ranking entities with respect to the query. Experimental results on two datasets, which build \nupon existing TREC document retrieval collections, indicate that the document-based mention \nfrequency of an entity and the Wikipedia-based query-to-entity similarity are both important \nfeatures for ranking.

While a number of candidate models exist, they have generally not been assessed in terms of their ability to emulate human judgments of simi- larity. To address this problem, we conducted an ex- periment that collected repeated similarity measures for each pair of documents in a small corpus of short news documents. An analysis of human performance showed inter-rater correlations of about 0.6. We then considered the ability of existing models\u2014using word- based, n-gram and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) approaches\u2014to model these human judgments. The best performed LSA model produced correlations of about 0.6, consistent with human performance, while the best performed word-based and n-gram models achieved correlations closer to 0.5. Many of the re- maining models showed almost no correlation with hu- man performance. Based on our results, we provide some discussion of the key strengths and weaknesses of the models we examined. Introduction Modeling the semantic similarity between text docu- ments is an interesting problem for cognitive science, for both theoretical and practical reasons. Theoret- ically, it involves the study of a basic cognitive pro- cess with richly structured natural stimuli. Practically, search engines, text corpus visualizations, and a vari- ety of other applications for filtering, sorting, retriev- ing, and generally handling text rely fundamentally on similarity measures. For this reason, the ability to as- sess semantic similarity in an accurate, automated, and scalable way is a key determinant of the effectiveness of most information handling and decision support soft- ware that deals with text. A variety of different approaches have been devel- oped for modeling text document similarity. These in- clude simple word-based, keyword-based and n-gram measures (e.g., Salton, 1989; Damashek, 1995), and more complicated approaches such as Latent Seman- tic Analysis (LSA: Deerwester et al., 1990; Landauer and Dumais, 1997). While all of these approaches have achieved some level of practical success, they have gen- erally not been assessed in terms of their ability to model human judgments of text document similarity. The most likely reason for this failure is that no suit- able empirical data exist, and considerable effort is in- volved in collecting pairwise ratings of text document similarity for even a moderate number of documents. This paper reports the collection of data that give ten independent ratings of the similarity of every pair of 50 short text documents, and so represents an attempt to establish a \u2018psychological ground truth\u2019 for evaluating models. Using the new data, we report a first eval- uation of the ability of word-based, n-gram and LSA approaches to model human judgments. Experiment Materials The text corpus evaluated by human judges contained 50 documents selected from the Australian Broadcast- ing Corporation\u2019s news mail service, which provides text e-mails of headline stories. The documents varied in length from 51 to 126 words, and covered a number of broad topics. A further 314 documents from the same were collected to act as a larger \u2018backgrounding\u2019 corpus for LSA. Both document sets were assessed against a stan- dard corpus of five English texts using four models of language. These were the log-normal, generalized in- verse Gauss-Poisson (with \u03b3 = \u22120.5), Yule-Simon and Zipfian models (Baayen, 2001). Both document sets were within the normal range of English text for word frequency spectrum and vocabulary growth and were therefore regarded as representative of normal English texts. Subjects The subjects were 83 University of Adelaide students (29 males and 54 females), with a mean age of 19.7 years. They were each paid with a ten (Australian) dollar gift voucher for every 100 document pair ratings made.", "citingTitle": "Knowledge Graph Exploration for Natural Language Understanding in Web Information Retrieval", "citedTitle": "An Empirical Evaluation of Models of Text Document Similarity"}

Results were statistically handled as to obtain Pearson's correlation coefficients of the results from Omics investigation in relation to canonical tenderness-related parameters, including Warner Bratzler shear force, myofibrillar degradation (at 48 h and 10 days after slaughter), sarcomere length and total collagen content. As a result, we could observe that the tender meat group was characterized by higher levels of glycolytic enzymes, which were over-phosphorylated and produced accumulation of glycolytic intermediates. Oxidative stress promoted meat tenderness and elicited heat shock protein responses, which in turn triggered apoptosis-like cascades along with PARP fragmentation. Phosphorylation was found to be a key process in post mortem muscle conversion to meat, as it was shown not only to modulate glycolytic enzyme activities, but also mediate the stability of structural proteins at the Z-disk. On the other hand, phosphorylation of HSPs has been supposed to alter their functions through changing their affinity for target interactors. Analogies and breed-specific differences are highlighted throughout the text via a direct comparison of the present results against the ones obtained in a parallel study on Maremmana Longissimus dorsi. It emerges that, while the main cornerstones and the final outcome are maintained, post mortem metabolism in tender and tough meat yielding individuals is subtly modulated via specific higher levels of enzymes and amino acidic residue phosphorylation in a breed-specific fashion, and whether calcium homeostasis dysregulation was a key factor in Maremmana, higher early post mortem phosphocreatine levels in the Chianina tender group could favor a slower and prolonged glycolytic rate, prolonging the extent of the minimum hanging period necessary to obtain tender meat from this breed by a few days.", "citedAbstract": "Within a population of Charolais young bulls, two extreme groups of longissimus thoracis muscle samples, classified according to Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) of 55 degrees C grilled meat, were analyzed by 2D-electrophoresis.

Comparison of the mouse, chicken and zebrafish PSM oscillatory transcriptomes revealed networks of 40 to 100 cyclic genes mostly involved in Notch, Wnt and FGF signaling pathways. However, despite this conserved signaling oscillation, the identity of individual cyclic genes mostly differed between the three species, indicating a surprising evolutionary plasticity of the segmentation networks.", "citedAbstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe pattern of somites is traced out by a mechanism involving oscillating gene expression at the tail end of the embryo. In zebrafish, two linked oscillating genes, her1 and her7, coding for inhibitory gene regulatory proteins, are especially implicated in genesis of the oscillations, while Notch signaling appears necessary for synchronization of adjacent cells.\n\n\nRESULTS\nI show by mathematical simulation that direct autorepression of her1 and her7 by their own protein products provides a mechanism for the intracellular oscillator. This mechanism operates robustly even when one allows for the fact that gene regulation is an essentially noisy (stochastic) process. The predicted period is close to the observed period (30 min) and is dictated primarily by the transcriptional delay, the time taken to make an mRNA molecule. Through its coupling to her1/her7 expression, Notch signaling can keep the rapid oscillations in adjacent cells synchronized. When the coupling parameters are varied, however, the model system can switch to oscillations of a much longer period, resembling that of the mouse or chick somitogenesis oscillator and governed by the delays in the Notch pathway. Such Notch-mediated synchronous oscillations are predicted even in the absence of direct her1/her7 autoregulation, through operation of the standard Notch signaling pathway that is usually assumed simply to give lateral inhibition.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDirect autorepression of a gene by its own product can generate oscillations, with a period determined by the transcriptional and translational delays. Simple as they are, such systems show surprising behaviors. To understand them, unaided intuition is not enough: we need mathematics.", "citingTitle": "Evolutionary plasticity of segmentation clock networks", "citedTitle": "Autoinhibition with Transcriptional Delay A Simple Mechanism for the Zebrafish Somitogenesis Oscillator"}

The key idea is to train and maintain two competing one-class support vector machines (1SVMs) at each pixel location, which model local color distributions for foreground and background, respectively. We advocate the usage of two competing local classifiers, as it provides higher discriminative power and allows better handling of ambiguities.

As a result it yields a closed-form update formula, a central component of the proposed algorithm to enable prompt adaptation to spatio-temporal changes. We also analyze the mistake bound and discuss issues such as dealing with non-stationary distributions, making use of kernels and efficient inference by a variant of dynamic programming. By exploiting the inherently concurrent structure, the proposed approach is designed to work with the highly parallel graphics processors (GPUs) to facilitate realtime analysis.

Neuronal migration is not just a simple movement of the cell body, but a consequence of various morphological changes and coordinated subcellular events. Recent advances in in vivo and ex vivo cell biological approaches, such as in utero gene transfer, slice culture and ex vivo chemical inhibitor techniques, have revealed details of the morphological and molecular aspects of neuronal migration. Migrating neurons have been found to have a unique structure, dilation or swelling, at the proximal region of the leading process; this structure is not found in other migrating cell types. The formation of this structure is followed by nuclear deformation and forward movement, and coordination of this three-step sequential morphological change (the dilation/swelling formation, nuclear elongation and nuclear movement) is essential for proper neuronal migration and the construction of a functional brain structure. In this review, we will introduce the morphological features of this unique structure in migrating neurons and summarize what is known about the molecules regulating the dilation/swelling formation and nuclear deformation and movement.", "citedAbstract": "During neural development, the cytoskeleton of newborn neurons undergoes extensive and dynamic remodelling to facilitate the sequential steps of neurogenesis, cell migration and terminal differentiation.

However, few studies have examined the effects of exposure over decades, or which time windows of long term exposure are most relevant. We investigated the long term effects of residential air pollution on total and cause-specific mortality and incidence of myocardial infarction in a well-characterized cohort of men in Sweden.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cohort of 7494 men in Gothenburg was examined in 1970-1973 and followed subsequently to determine predictors of cardiovascular disease. We collected data on residential address and cause-specific mortality for the years 1973-2007. Each individual was assigned yearly nitrogen oxides (NOx) exposure based on dispersion models. Using multivariable Cox regression and generalized additive models with time-dependent exposure, we studied the association between three different time windows of residential NOx exposure, and selected outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the years 1973-2007, a total of 5669 deaths, almost half of which were due to cardiovascular diseases, occurred in the cohort. Levels of NOx exposure decreased during the study period, from a median of 38 \u00b5g/m(3) in 1973 to 17 \u00b5g/m(3) in 2007. Total non-accidental mortality was associated with participants' NOx exposure in the last year (the year of outcome) (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, per 10 \u00b5g/m(3)), with the mean NOx exposure during the last 5 years, and with the mean NOx exposure since enrolment (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.04 for both). The associations were similar (HR 1.01-1.03), but generally not statistically significant, for cardiovascular, ischemic heart disease, and acute myocardial infarction mortality, and weaker for cerebrovascular and respiratory mortality. There was no association between NOx exposure and incident myocardial infarction.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nLong term residential exposure to NOx at these relatively low exposure levels in Gothenburg was associated with total non-accidental mortality. The association was as strong for NOx exposure in the last year as for longer exposure windows. The effect was near linear, and only marginally affected by confounders and effect modifiers.

The number of studies examining chronic exposures in cohorts is growing, with more recent studies conducted among women finding risk estimates of greater magnitude. Questions remain regarding sex differences in the relationship of chronic particulate matter (PM) exposures with mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. Objectives: In this study we explored these associations in the all-male Health Professionals Follow-Up Study prospective cohort. Methods: The same spatiotemporal exposure estimation models, similar outcomes, and biennially updated covariates were used as those previously applied in the female Nurses\u2019 Health Study cohort. Results: Among 17,545 men residing in the northeastern and midwestern United States, there were 2,813 deaths, including 746 cases of fatal coronary heart disease (CHD). An interquartile range change (4 \u00b5g/m3) in average exposure to PM \u2264 2.5 \u00b5m in diameter in the 12 previous months was not associated with all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87\u20131.00] or fatal CHD (HR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87\u20131.13) in fully adjusted models. Findings were similar for separate models of exposure to PM \u2264 10 \u00b5m in diameter and PM between 2.5 and 10 \u00b5m in diameter and for copollutant models. Conclusions: Among this cohort of men with high socioeconomic status living in the midwestern and northeastern United States, the results did not support an association of chronic PM exposures with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in models with time-varying covariates.

The mean R-R interval, however, was increased in patients with heart failure, relative to normal subjects.In both groups, the R-R interval histograms had two peaks, i. e. a short daytime peak and a long night-time peak. Xamoterol decreased the median of the night-time peak without changing the daytime peak in normal subjects. In contrast, it increased the median of the daytime peak without producing a significant change in the nighttime peak in patients with heart failure. Levels of plasma NA were significantly higher in patients than in normal subjects under all conditions.Thus, in normal subjects xamoterol predominantly increased the slower heart rate at night with only a minor effect on the higher heart rate in the daytime, whereas it predominantly attenuated the daytime tachycardia induced by sympathetic stimulation in patients with heart failure.It is concluded that xamoterol tends overall to act as a\u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist during the day, especially in the daytime in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. Its antagonist rather than its agonist effect may account for the long-term efficacy of xamoterol in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.", "citingTitle": "Muscle pump-dependent self-perfusion mechanism in legs in normal subjects and patients with heart failure.", "citedTitle": "Predominant\u03b2-adrenoceptor blocking effect of xamoterol averaged over the day in patients with mild to moderate heart failure: insight into the mechanism of its long-term clinical efficacy"}

Specific antivirals for JEV would be of great importance, particularly in those cases where the infection has become persistent. Being indispensable for flaviviral replication, the NS2B-NS3 protease is a promising target for design of anti-flaviviral inhibitors. Contrary to related flaviviral proteases, the JEV NS2B-NS3 protease is structurally and mechanistically much less characterized. Here we aimed at establishing a straightforward procedure for cloning, expression, purification and biochemical characterization of JEV NS2B(H)-NS3pro protease. Methodology/Principal Findings The full-length sequence of JEV NS2B-NS3 genotype III strain JaOArS 982 was obtained as a synthetic gene. The sequence of NS2B(H)-NS3pro was generated by splicing by overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) and cloned into the pTrcHisA vector. Hexahistidine-tagged NS2B(H)-NS3pro, expressed in E. coli as soluble protein, was purified to >95% purity by a single-step immobilized metal affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of the purified enzyme demonstrated NS2B(H)-NS3pro precursor and its autocleavage products, NS3pro and NS2B(H), as 36, 21, and 10 kDa bands, respectively. Kinetic parameters, K m and k cat, for fluorogenic protease model substrates, Boc-GRR-amc, Boc-LRR-amc, Ac-nKRR-amc, Bz-nKRR-amc, Pyr-RTKR-amc and Abz-(R)4SAG-nY-amide, were obtained using inner filter effect correction. The highest catalytic efficiency k cat /K m was found for Pyr-RTKR-amc (k cat/K m: 1962.96\u00b185.0 M\u22121 s\u22121) and the lowest for Boc-LRR-amc (k cat/K m: 3.74\u00b10.3 M\u22121 s\u22121).

In the present study, we have investigated determinants of substrate specificity of the dengue virus NS3 protease by using internally quenched fluorogenic peptides containing Abz (o-aminobenzoic acid; synonymous to anthranilic acid) and 3-nitrotyrosine (nY) representing both native and chimaeric polyprotein cleavage site sequences. By using this combinatorial approach, we were able to describe the substrate preferences and determinants of specificity for the dengue virus NS2B(H)-NS3pro protease. Kinetic parameters (kcat/K(m)) for the hydrolysis of peptide substrates with systematic truncations at the prime and non-prime side revealed a length preference for peptides spanning the P4-P3' residues, and the peptide Abz-RRRRSAGnY-amide based on the dengue virus capsid protein processing site was discovered as a novel and efficient substrate of the NS3 protease (kcat/K(m)=11087 M(-1) x s(-1)). Thus, while having confirmed the exclusive preference of the NS3 protease for basic residues at the P1 and P2 positions, we have also shown that the presence of basic amino acids at the P3 and P4 positions is a major specificity-determining feature of the dengue virus NS3 protease. Investigation of the substrate peptide Abz-KKQRAGVLnY-amide based on the NS2B/NS3 polyprotein cleavage site demonstrated an unexpected high degree of cleavage efficiency.

Therefore, it was suggested that (1) phosphene perception caused a disruption of the early visual processing for non-canonical images of objects, which was more profound in phosphene face processing; (2) the face-specific processing was reserved under prosthetic vision and (3) holistic processing was the major stage in early visual processing of phosphene face recognition, while part-based processing was attenuated due to the loss of the details.", "citingTitle": "Effects of Images with Different Levels of Familiarity on EEG", "citedTitle": "Neurophysiology study of early visual processing of face and non-face recognition under simulated prosthetic vision"}

Analysis of the transgene expression pattern by X-gal staining of embryos revealed that: (a) The proximal 0.6 kb of promoter sequence activated transcription in mesenchymal cells at sites of insertion of superficial muscular aponeurosis into the skin; tendons were also faintly positive. (b) The region between -4.0 and -5.4 kb from the transcription start site was required for activation of the transgene in nerves.

Staining increased at later stages of development and most connective tissues were positive at 16.5 days and later. Strongly staining tissues were joints, intervertebral disks, perichondrium, periostium, dermis, skeletal muscle and heart valves, whereas cartilage and bone were very poorly labelled. Epithelia and the central nervous system were completely negative. In several organs, notably lung, salivary glands and the digestive tract, staining was concentrated underneath epithelia. This staining pattern was different from that for collagen type I, which was evenly distributed in the subepithelial mesenchyme. The pattern of distribution of the protein, revealed by immunocytochemistry, was coincident with that of the alpha 1 (VI) mRNA.

When the cells were grown on a mixture of 4-chlorophenol, 4-nitrophenol and phenol, 4-chlorophenol degradation apparently was delayed until 4-nitrophenol was almost completely depleted. Phenol was degraded more slowly than the other compounds and not until 4-nitrophenol and 4-chlorophenol were depleted, despite this being the least toxic compound of the three. A similar order of degradation was observed in non-sterile soil slurries inoculated with A. chlorophenolicus. The kinetics of degradation of the substituted phenols suggest that the preferential order of their depletion could be due to their respective pKa values and that the dissociated phenolate ions are the substrates.

Alterations of the commensal bacterial communities or mucosal barrier can disrupt immune function. Chronic stress interferes with bacterial community structure (specifically, \u03b1-diversity) and the integrity of the intestinal barrier. These interferences can contribute to chronic stress-induced increases in systemic IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. Chronic stress, however, produces many physiological changes that could indirectly influence immune activity. In addition to IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, exposure to acute stressors upregulates a plethora of inflammatory proteins, each having unique synthesis and release mechanisms. We therefore tested the hypothesis that acute stress-induced inflammatory protein responses are dependent on the commensal bacteria, and more specifically, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shed from Gram-negative intestinal commensal bacteria. We present evidence that both reducing commensal bacteria using antibiotics and neutralizing LPS using endotoxin inhibitor (EI) attenuates increases in some (inflammasome dependent, IL-1 and IL-18), but not all (inflammasome independent, IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1) inflammatory proteins in the blood of male F344 rats exposed to an acute tail shock stressor.

This previously unrecognized region of the root, intercalated between the apical meristem and the zone of rapid cell elongation, was originally discovered as the result of a morphometric analysis of the breadthlength ratios of cells along the length of the maize root (BaluSka et al., 1990). The analysis indicated that as cells are displaced away from the root apex, their growth is adjusted in such a way that, in the immediate postmitotic region, approximately isodiametric (cuboidal) cellular shapes are obtained. Thus, the term \"postmitotic 'isodiametric' growth\" (or PIG) was coined for this region. In the cortex of maize primary roots the PIG zone was about 450 pm; in cultured tomato roots its length was about 380 pm. The length of this region thus represents about 5.5% of the entire growth zone. Subsequent studies confirmed the uniqueness of the cells located in the PIG zone, not only from a morphometrical point of view, but also on account of their specific cytological and physiological properties (Barlow et al., 1991; BaluSka et al., l992,1994,1996a, 1996c; Ishikawa and Evans, 1992, 1993, 1995). From a cellular point of view, the root tip has (a) a zone of cell division, a zone of more-or-less isotropic cell growth in which the cells both elongate and increase in width at similar rates; and (b) a zone of elongation in which cell growth is distinctly anisotropic and the rate of elongation is much greater than in the PIG zone. In cell-based terminology, therefore, the term \"zone of cell elongation\" should be reserved for root cells that grow in this strictly polar fashion. Significantly, our morphometric studies at the cellular leve1 showed that an abrupt decline of cellular widening coincided precisely with a prominent increase in the rate of cell lengthening, and this occurred at the base of the PIG region (BaluSka et al., 1990, 1994; Barlow et al., 1991). This occurrence provided the first hint that the newly formed postmitotic cells of the root may undergo some kind of preparatory phase wherein they adjust or reorganize their growth from the formerly slow, mitotic mode of growth to a rapid mode of elongation. Rapid cell elongation in roots is based in part on an extensive uptake of solutes coupled with the formation of a prominent vacuolar compartment. These events accelerate cell expansion, which is channeled with the aid of specific alignments of both the cortical microtubules (CMTs) in the cytoplasm and the cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall, into strictly anisotropic cell enlargement. A significant reorganization of the metabolic machinery is required to achieve this new mode of cell growth. For example, cells of maize root apices increase their volume approximately 10-fold in the 13 h during which they migrate through the elongation region, whereas in the meristem cell volume may only double during this period (BaluSka et al., 1996~). Once the rapid acceleration of cell growth has been triggered, it must be supported by a robust synthetic machinery that is obviously not yet operational in cells that are just ceasing their meristematic phase of development. If it were otherwise, root cells would commence their rapid elongation simultaneously with the termination of mitotic division. Not a11 cells of the root cease to divide at the same distance from the root tip, and it was recently found that the proximal limit of the meristem fluctuates in a rhythmic manner in accordance with a programmed pattern of transverse cell division within its constituent cell files (Liick et al., 1996). It is probably advantageous, therefore, for the early postmitotic root cells to enter a critica1 preparatory phase, located in a special transition zone behind the meristem, where they acquire the ability to embark on rapid elongation. Moreover, some supracellular organizing process within this transition zone may ensure the simultaneous commencement of the rapid elongation phase in cells of different tissues (epidermis, cortex, stele, etc.) at a particular distance from the root tip. Root-generated electric fields, for example, may be one way of defining the conditions required for a coordinated program of rapid elongation after cells have completed their preparatory phase within the transition zone. Also, within this zone cells develop the necessary synthetic machinery for the biogenesis of new tonoplast and plasma membranes, cell-wall components, new enzymatic complexes, and cytoplasmic structures that support such rapid growth. Aside from the basic synthetic machinery for cell growth, individual elements of the cytoskeleton can also be expected to alter their intracellular distribution from those configurations that support mitotic cell growth and division to arrangements that enable rapid cell elongation. In cells of the postmitotic transition zone, the CMTs change from loosely organized transverse arrays to an exclusively transverse orientation with respect to the root axis; the latter orientation is often accompanied by the appearance of", "citingTitle": "Altered growth and root tip morphology in Pisum sativum L. in response to altered expression of a gene expressed in border cells", "citedTitle": "Specialized Zones of Development in Roots: View from the Cellular Level"}

We focused on 36 miRNAs upregulated in the old mice compared with those in the young mice. The potential targets of these 36 miRNAs included 11 critical Eph/Ephrin synaptic signaling components. The expression levels of several genes in the Eph/Ephrin pathway, including EphB2, were significantly downregulated in the aged hippocampus. EphB2 is a known regulator of synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons, in part by regulating the surface expression of the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit. We found that EphB2 is a direct target of miR\u2010204 among miRNAs that were upregulated with age. The transfection of primary hippocampal neurons with a miR\u2010204 mimic suppressed both EphB2 mRNA and protein expression and reduced the surface expression of NR1.

They also participate in activity-induced long-term changes in synaptic strength such as long-term potentiation (LTP). When expressed on axon terminals, ephrins promote presynaptic differentiation and enhance neurotransmitter release, thereby supporting presynaptic forms of LTP.

The challenge is to alter differentiation toward functional cell types or tissues by directing ES cells to a specific fate. Efforts have been made to understand the molecular mechanisms that are required for the formation of the different germ layers and tissues from ES cells, and these mechanisms appear to be very similar in the mouse embryo. Differentiation toward mesoderm and mesoderm derivatives such as cardiac tissue or hemangioblasts has been demonstrated; however, the roles of Activin A/Nodal, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling in the early patterning of ES cell-derived pan-mesoderm and anterior visceral endoderm (aVE) have not been reported yet. We therefore analyzed the roles of Activin A/Nodal, BMP, and FGF signaling in the patterning of ES cell-derived mesoderm as well as specification of the aVE by using a dual ES cell differentiation system combining a loss-of-function with a gain-of-function approach. We found that Activin A or Nodal directed the nascent mesoderm toward axial mesoderm and mesendoderm, while Bmp4 was inducing posterior and extraembryonic mesoderm at the expense of anterior primitive streak cells. FGF signaling appeared to have an important role in mesoderm differentiation by allowing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of the newly formed mesoderm cells that would lead to their further patterning. Moreover, inhibition of FGF signaling resulted in increased expression of axial mesoderm markers. Additionally, we revealed that the formation of aVE cells from ES cells requires FGF-dependent Activin A/Nodal signaling and the attenuation of Bmp4 signaling.", "citedAbstract": "The vertebrate Fgf8 gene produces multiple protein isoforms by alternative splicing. Two evolutionarily conserved spliceforms, Fgf8a and Fgf8b, exhibit distinct bioactivities, with Fgf8b having a more potent inductive activity due to higher affinity for Fgf receptors. To investigate the in vivo requirement for Fgf8b, we created a splice-site mutation abolishing Fgf8b expression in mice. Analysis of this mutant has uncovered a novel function of Fgf8 signaling before the onset of gastrulation. We show that the loss of Fgf8b disrupts the induction of the brachyury gene in the pregastrular embryo and, in addition, disrupts the proper alignment of the anteroposterior axis with the shape of the embryo and the uterine axes at embryonic day (E) 6.5. Importantly, Fgf8-null embryos display the same phenotype as Fgf8b-deficient embryos at E6.5, demonstrating that signaling by Fgf8b is specifically required for development of the pregastrular embryo. By contrast, during gastrulation, Fgf8a can partially compensate for the loss of Fgf8b in mesoderm specification. We show that an increased level of Fgf8a expression, which leads to Fgf4 expression in the primitive streak, can also promote mesoderm migration in the absence of Fgf8b. Therefore, different Fgf signals may have distinct requirements for the morphogenesis and gene regulation before and during gastrulation.

Physical laws dictate quadratic relationships between observable quantities and voltage state variables, hence rendering the PSSE problem nonconvex and NP-hard. Existing SE solvers largely rely on iterative optimization methods or semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Even when based on noiseless measurements, convergence of the former is sensitive to the initialization, while the latter is challenged by small-size measurements especially when voltage magnitudes are not available at all buses. At the price of running time, this paper proposes a novel feasible point pursuit (FPP)-based SE solver, which iteratively seeks feasible solutions for a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming reformulation of the weighted least-squares (WLS) SE problem. Numerical tests corroborate that the novel FPP-based SE markedly improves upon the Gauss-Newton based WLS and SDR-based SE alternatives, also when noisy measurements are available.", "citedAbstract": "State estimation (SE) is an important task allowing power networks to monitor accurately the underlying system state, which is useful for security-constrained dispatch and power system control. For nonlinear AC power systems, SE amounts to minimizing a weighted least-squares cost that is inherently nonconvex, thus giving rise to many local optima. As a result, estimators used extensively in practice rely on iterative optimization methods, which are destined to return only locally optimal solutions, or even fail to converge. A semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation for SE has been advocated, which relies on the convex semidefinite relaxation (SDR) of the original problem and thereby renders it efficiently solvable. Theoretical analysis under simplified conditions is provided to shed light on the near-optimal performance of the SDR-based SE solution at polynomial complexity. The new approach is further pursued toward complementing traditional nonlinear measurements with linear synchrophasor measurements and reducing computational complexity through distributed implementations. Numerical tests on the standard IEEE 30- and 118-bus systems corroborate that the SE algorithms outperform existing alternatives, and approach near-optimal performance.", "citingTitle": "Power system state estimation via feasible point pursuit", "citedTitle": "Power System Nonlinear State Estimation Using Distributed Semidefinite Programming"}

In total, 80 adolescent couples (M age\u200a=\u200a15.48, SD\u200a=\u200a1.16) participated in a 4-wave prospective questionnaire and observational study, with one year between measurements.

The Ineffective Arguing Inventory (IAI) is a self-report measure that assesses a dysfunctional style of couple conflict resolution. The Conflict Resolution Style Inventory (CRSI) has complementary self-report and partner-report versions that assess four personal conflict resolution styles for each member of the couple. Subjects were both partners of 75 gay, 51 lesbian, 108 married non-parent, and 99 married parent couples. Findings for each inventory are presented regarding the factor structure of items, the internal consistency of composite scores, the 1-year stability of composite scores, the relation between couple members' composite scores, and the link between composite scores and relationship satisfaction, change in satisfaction, and relationship dissolution. Generally, results warrant further examination of the IAI and CRSI as measures of conflict for couples. All couples have to deal with conflict. Further, how that conflict is managed is linked to relationship satisfaction, change in relationship satisfaction, and relationship stability (Gottman, 1994; Heavey, Layne, & Christensen, 1993; Markman, Renick, Floyd, Stanley, & Clements, 1993; Noller & White, 1990). To date, perhaps the most productive method for studying relationship conflict has been to code videotapes of partner conversations for small samples of couples in a laboratory setting (e.g., Gottman, 1994). Without denying the value of these behavioral observations--in particular, for assessing sequences of couples' interactional styles during conflict--the present study is based on the premise that self-report and partner-report methodologies are also valuable ways to study couple conflict and may complement observational methodologies. One of the major limitations of observational studies of couple conflict is that they utilize very small, nonrepresentative samples. In fact, some of the inconsistent findings in observational studies regarding the types of conflict resolution strategies that are linked to declines in relationship satisfaction over time have been attributed to biased samples (Gottman, 1993). The availability of psychometrically sound self-report and partner-report measures of conflict resolution would help address this limitation by providing researchers with one method by which the link between conflict resolution and both relationship maintenance and relationship dissolution could be studied in large, representative samples. Some measures of couple conflict are available, including self-report measures of couple conflict resolution patterns (e.g., the Problem-Solving Communication scale of the Marital Satisfaction Inventory; Snyder, 1981), self-report measures of individual conflict resolution styles (e.g., the Marital Coping Inventory, Bowman, 1990), and self-report and partner-report measures of each partner's conflict resolution styles (e.g., the Interpersonal Communication Skills Inventory; Boyd & Roach, 1977) as well as sequences of partners' conflict resolution styles (e.g., the Communication Patterns Questionnaire; Christensen, 1988). However, no measure of couple conflict resolution could be found that was brief, was based on a coherent conceptual framework, and had comprehensively documented psychometric properties. Documenting psychometric properties include validating the measure against the major relationship outcomes used in behavioral observations in this area of study--relationship satisfaction, change in relationship satisfaction, and relationship stability (Gottman, 1994; Gottman & Krokoff, 1989; Markman et al., 1993). Accordingly, the purpose of this article is to present such preliminary psychometric data for two brief nonobservational measures of couple conflict. The first measure--the Ineffective Arguing Inventory (IAI)--assesses how the couple handles conflict, whereas the second measure the Conflict Resolution Styles Inventory (CRSI)--assesses each partner's individual style of handling conflict. \u2026", "citingTitle": "Do Conflict Resolution and Recovery Predict the Survival of Adolescents' Romantic Relationships?", "citedTitle": "Conflict Resolution Styles in Gay, Lesbian, Heterosexual Nonparent, and Heterosexual Parent Couples"}

The pathogenesis of hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic action of the mycotoxin aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) involves initial bioactivation by P450s to a reactive and electrophilic intermediate exo-aflatoxin B(1)-8,9-epoxide (exo-AFBO). Poultry, especially turkeys are extremely sensitive to AFB(1), a condition due, in part, to efficient epoxidation by P450 1A and 3A enzymes. We previously reported the discovery of P450 1A5 from turkey liver, which like its human homologue, 1A2, bioactivated AFB(1) to exo-AFBO and aflatoxin M(1) (AFM(1)). Here, we describe P450 3A37, the 3A4 homologue from turkey liver. This gene has an open reading frame (ORF) of 1512 bp, and the protein is predicted to be 504 amino acids with 97% identity to chicken P450 3A37. A truncated construct of the turkey P450 3A37 gene with 11 amino acids deleted from the hydrophobic N-terminal region was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, the protein from which exhibited a CO difference spectrum typical of P450s. Like human P450 3A4, 3A37 biotransformed AFB(1) to exo-AFBO and aflatoxin Q(1) (AFQ(1)) and possessed nifedipine oxidation activity, both of which were inhibited by the P450 3A4 inhibitor 17alpha-ethynylestradiol. Oxidation of AFB(1) to exo-AFBO and AFQ(1) by P450 3A37 followed sigmoidal Hill kinetics, suggestive of an allosteric interaction between the enzyme and AFB(1). The Hill coefficient (n) value was 1.9 for exo-AFBO and 1.6 for AFQ(1), indicative of positive cooperativity. The calculated K(m) and V(max) values for the formation of exo-AFBO were 287 +/- 21 muM and 1.45 +/- 0.07 nmol/min/nmol P450, respectively, whereas those of AFQ(1) formation were 302 +/- 51 muM and 7.86 +/- 0.75 nmol/min/nmol P450, respectively.

Many distance functions have been proposed, which attempt to closely mimic human recognition. Unfortunately, some of these well-designed distance functions do not follow the triangle inequality and are therefore nonmetric. As a consequence, efficient retrieval by using these nonmetric distance functions becomes more challenging, since most existing index structures assume that the indexed distance functions are metric. In this paper, we address this challenging problem by proposing an efficient method, that is, local constant embedding (LCE), which divides the data set into disjoint groups so that the triangle inequality holds within each group by constant shifting. Furthermore, we design a pivot selection approach for the converted metric distance and create an index structure to speed up the retrieval efficiency. Moreover, we also propose a novel method to answer approximate similarity search in the nonmetric space with a guaranteed query accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method works well on various nonmetric distance functions and improves the retrieval efficiency by an order of magnitude compared to the linear scan and existing retrieval approaches with no false dismissals.", "citedAbstract": "An important consideration in similarity-based retrieval of moving object trajectories is the definition of a distance function.

Analysis and comparison of EDR with other popular distance functions, such as Euclidean distance, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Edit distance with Real Penalty (ERP), and Longest Common Subsequences (LCSS), indicate that EDR is more robust than Euclidean distance, DTW and ERP, and it is on average 50% more accurate than LCSS.

Here, a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach has been used to analyse the adaptational responses of B. subtilis to low temperature. Propagation of B. subtilis in minimal medium at 15 degrees C triggered the induction of 279 genes and the repression of 301 genes in comparison to cells grown at 37 degrees C. The analysis thus revealed profound adjustments in the overall gene expression profile in chill-adapted cells. Important transcriptional changes in low-temperature-grown cells comprise the induction of the SigB-controlled general stress regulon, the induction of parts of the early sporulation regulons (SigF, SigE and SigG) and the induction of a regulatory circuit (RapA/PhrA and Opp) that is involved in the fine-tuning of the phosphorylation status of the Spo0A response regulator. The analysis of chill-stress-repressed genes revealed reductions in major catabolic (glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, ATP synthesis) and anabolic routes (biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, haem and fatty acids) that likely reflect the slower growth rates at low temperature. Low-temperature repression of part of the SigW regulon and of many genes with predicted functions in chemotaxis and motility was also noted. The proteome analysis of chill-adapted cells indicates a major contribution of post-transcriptional regulation phenomena in adaptation to low temperature.

Preloading cells with sigmaB-dependent general stress proteins prior to growth-inhibiting stress conferred considerable protection against heat and salt. Exhaustion of glucose or phosphate induced the sigmaB response, but surprisingly, sigmaB did not seem to be required for starvation survival.

However, nothing is known about the enzymes involved in biosynthesis of WE and their role in mycobacterial dormancy. We report that two putative Mtb fatty acyl-CoA reductase genes (fcr) expressed in E. coli display catalytic reduction of fatty acyl-CoA to fatty aldehyde and fatty alcohol. Both enzymes (FCR1/Rv3391) and FCR2/Rv1543) showed a requirement for NADPH as the reductant, a preference for oleoyl-CoA over saturated fatty acyl-CoA and were inhibited by thiol-directed reagents. We generated Mtb gene-knockout mutants for each reductase. Metabolic incorporation of 14C-oleate into fatty alcohols and WE was severely diminished in the mutants under dormancy-inducing stress conditions that are thought to be encountered by the pathogen in the host. The fatty acyl-CoA reductase activity in cell lysates of the mutants under nitric oxide stress was significantly reduced when compared with the wild type. Complementation restored the lost activity completely in the \u0394fcr1 mutant and partially in the \u0394fcr2 mutant. WE synthesis was inhibited in both \u0394fcr mutants. The \u0394fcr mutants exhibited faster growth rates, an increased uptake of 14C-glycerol suggesting increased permeability of the cell wall, increased metabolic activity levels and impaired phenotypic antibiotic tolerance under dormancy-inducing combined multiple stress conditions. Complementation of the mutants did not restore the development of antibiotic tolerance to wild-type levels. Transcript analysis of \u0394fcr mutants showed upregulation of genes involved in energy generation and transcription, indicating the inability of the mutants to become dormant. Our results indicate that the fcr1 and fcr2 gene products are involved in WE synthesis under in vitro dormancy-inducing conditions and that WE play a critical role in reaching a dormant state.

The RSS contains highly conserved heptamer (consensus: 5'-CACAGTG) and nonamer (consensus: 5'-ACAAAAACC) motifs separated by either 12- or 23-base pairs of poorly conserved sequence. The high mobility group proteins HMGB1 and HMGB2 (HMGB1/2) are highly abundant architectural DNA binding proteins known to promote RAG-mediated synapsis and cleavage of consensus recombination signals in vitro by facilitating RSS binding and bending by the RAG1/2 complex. HMGB1/2 are known to recognize distorted DNA structures such as four-way junctions, and damaged or modified DNA. Whether HMGB1/2 can promote RAG-mediated DNA cleavage at sites lacking a canonical RSS by targeting or stabilizing structural distortions is unclear, but is important for understanding the etiology of chromosomal translocations involving antigen receptor genes and proto-oncogene sequences that do not contain an obvious RSS-like element.ResultsHere we identify a novel DNA breakpoint site in the plasmid V(D)J recombination substrate pGG49 (bps6197) that is cleaved by the RAG proteins via a nick-hairpin mechanism. The bps6197 sequence lacks a recognizable heptamer at the breakpoint (5'-CCTGACG-3') but contains a nonamer-like element (5'-ACATTAACC-3') 30 base pairs from the cleavage site. We find that RAG-mediated bps6197 cleavage is promoted by HMGB1/2, requiring both HMG-box domains to be intact to facilitate RAG-mediated cleavage, and is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-RSS. A dyad-symmetric inverted repeat sequence lying 5' to the breakpoint is implicated as a target for HMGB1/2 activity.ConclusionWe have identified a novel DNA sequence, called bps6197, that supports standard V(D)J-type cleavage despite the absence of an apparent heptamer motif. Efficient RAG-mediated bps6197 cleavage requires the presence of HMGB1/2, is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-RSS partner, and is directed in part by an inverted repeat sequence adjacent to the DNA cleavage site. These results have important implications for understanding how the RAG proteins can introduce a DNA double-strand break at DNA sequences that do not contain an obvious heptamer-like motif.", "citedAbstract": "V(D)J recombination is a process integral to lymphocyte development. However, this process is not always benign, since certain lymphoid malignancies exhibit recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations and deletions, that harbor molecular signatures suggesting an origin from aberrant V(D)J recombination. Translocations involving LMO2, TAL1, Ttg-1, and Hox11, as well as a recurrent interstitial deletion at 1p32 involving SIL/SCL, are cited examples of illegitimate V(D)J recombination. Previous studies using extrachromosomal substrates reveal that cryptic recombination signal sequences (cRSSs) identified near the translocation breakpoint in these examples support V(D)J recombination with efficiencies ranging from about 30- to 20,000-fold less than bona fide V(D)J recombination signals. To understand the molecular basis for these large differences, we investigated the binding and cleavage of these cRSSs by the RAG1/2 proteins that initiate V(D)J recombination. We find that the RAG proteins comparably bind all cRSSs tested, albeit more poorly than a consensus RSS. We show that four cRSSs that support levels of V(D)J recombination above background levels in cell culture (LMO2, TAL1, Ttg-1, and SIL) are also cleaved by the RAG proteins in vitro with efficiencies ranging from 18 to 70% of a consensus RSS. Cleavage of LMO2 and Ttg-1 by the RAG proteins can also be detected in cell culture using ligation-mediated PCR. In contrast, Hox11 and SCL are nicked but not cleaved efficiently in vitro, and cleavage at other adventitious sites in plasmid substrates may also limit the ability to detect recombination activity at these cRSSs in cell culture.", "citingTitle": "HMGB1/2 can target DNA for illegitimate cleavage by the RAG1/2 complex", "citedTitle": "V(D)J Recombinase Binding and Cleavage of Cryptic Recombination Signal Sequences Identified from Lymphoid Malignancies*"}

Underage drinking contributes to the 3 leading causes of death (unintentional injury, homicide, and suicide) among persons aged 12 to 20 years. Most adverse health effects from underage drinking stem from acute intoxication resulting from binge drinking. Although binge drinking, typically defined as consuming \u22655 drinks on an occasion, is a common pattern of alcohol consumption among youth, few population-based studies have focused specifically on the characteristics of underage binge drinkers and their associated health risk behaviors. METHODS. We analyzed data on current drinking, binge drinking, and other health risk behaviors from the 2003 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by using SAS and SUDAAN statistical software. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between different patterns of alcohol consumption and health risk behaviors. RESULTS. Overall, 44.9% of high school students reported drinking alcohol during the past 30 days (28.8% binge drank and 16.1% drank alcohol but did not binge drink). Although girls reported more current drinking with no binge drinking, binge-drinking rates were similar among boys and girls. Binge-drinking rates increased with age and school grade. Students who binge drank were more likely than both nondrinkers and current drinkers who did not binge to report poor school performance and involvement in other health risk behaviors such as riding with a driver who had been drinking, being currently sexually active, smoking cigarettes or cigars, being a victim of dating violence, attempting suicide, and using illicit drugs. A strong dose-response relationship was found between the frequency of binge drinking and the prevalence of other health risk behaviors. CONCLUSIONS. Binge drinking is the most common pattern of alcohol consumption among high school youth who drink alcohol and is strongly associated with a wide range of other health risk behaviors. Effective intervention strategies (eg, enforcement of the minimum legal drinking age, screening and brief intervention, and increasing alcohol taxes) should be implemented to prevent underage alcohol consumption and adverse health and social consequences resulting from this behavior.", "citingTitle": "Evaluating College Students' Displayed Alcohol References on Facebook and Twitter.", "citedTitle": "Binge Drinking and Associated Health Risk Behaviors Among High School Students"}

Oral talniflumate did not alter crypt goblet cell numbers or change intestinal expression of mCLCA3 but tended to decrease crypt mucoid impaction.

Existing SD methods can be classified into two categories: 1) Continuous Representation based SD (CR-SD), where typically Spherical Harmonic (SH) representation is used for convenient analytical solutions, and 2) Discrete Representation based SD (DR-SD), where the signal profile is represented by a discrete set of basis functions uniformly oriented on the unit sphere. A feasible fODF should be non-negative and should integrate to unity throughout the unit sphere S(2). However, to our knowledge, most existing SH-based SD methods enforce non-negativity only on discretized points and not the whole continuum of S(2). Maximum Entropy SD (MESD) and Cartesian Tensor Fiber Orientation Distributions (CT-FOD) are the only SD methods that ensure non-negativity throughout the unit sphere. They are however computational intensive and are susceptible to errors caused by numerical spherical integration. Existing SD methods are also known to overestimate the number of fiber directions, especially in regions with low anisotropy. DR-SD introduces additional error in peak detection owing to the angular discretization of the unit sphere. This paper proposes a SD framework, called Non-Negative SD (NNSD), to overcome all the limitations above. NNSD is significantly less susceptible to the false-positive peaks, uses SH representation for efficient analytical spherical deconvolution, and allows accurate peak detection throughout the whole unit sphere. We further show that NNSD and most existing SD methods can be extended to work on multi-shell data by introducing a three-dimensional fiber response function. We evaluated NNSD in comparison with Constrained SD (CSD), a quadratic programming variant of CSD, MESD, and an L1-norm regularized non-negative least-squares DR-SD.

Our feature estimation is expressed as a variational minimization process leading to a variational framework which is robust to noise.

The enzymatic activity of TRAF6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is thought to have a pivotal role in triggering these processes. In this paper, we reexamined this assumption by generating mice expressing a catalytically inactive mutant of TRAF6. The bone structure of the mice was normal and a major intracellular signaling pathway of the immune system could still be switched on. We found that other E3 ligases, Pellino1 and Pellino2, could generate the ubiquitin chains needed to switch on immune signaling in human cells expressing catalytically inactive TRAF6. Our findings identify essential roles of TRAF6 that are independent of its enzymatic activity. It is widely accepted that the essential role of TRAF6 in vivo is to generate the Lys63-linked ubiquitin (K63-Ub) chains needed to activate the \u201cmaster\u201d protein kinase TAK1. Here, we report that TRAF6 E3 ligase activity contributes to but is not essential for the IL-1\u2013dependent formation of K63-Ub chains, TAK1 activation, or IL-8 production in human cells, because Pellino1 and Pellino2 generate the K63-Ub chains required for signaling in cells expressing E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6 mutants. The IL-1\u2013induced formation of K63-Ub chains and ubiquitylation of IRAK1, IRAK4, and MyD88 was abolished in TRAF6/Pellino1/Pellino2 triple-knockout (KO) cells, but not in TRAF6 KO or Pellino1/2 double-KO cells. The reexpression of E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6 mutants partially restored IL-1 signaling in TRAF6 KO cells, but not in TRAF6/Pellino1/Pellino2 triple-KO cells. Pellino1-generated K63-Ub chains activated the TAK1 complex in vitro with similar efficiently to TRAF6-generated K63-Ub chains. The early phase of TLR signaling and the TLR-dependent secretion of IL-10 (controlled by IRAKs 1 and 2) was only reduced modestly in primary macrophages from knockin mice expressing the E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6[L74H] mutant, but the late-phase production of IL-6, IL-12, and TNF\u03b1 (controlled only by the pseudokinase IRAK2) was abolished. RANKL-induced signaling in macrophages and the differentiation of bone marrow to osteoclasts was similar in TRAF6[L74H] and wild-type cells, explaining why the bone structure and teeth of the TRAF6[L74H] mice was normal, unlike TRAF6 KO mice.

Interaction of TRAF6 with Ubc13 involves direct contacts of the RING and the preceding residues, and the first zinc finger has a structural role. Unexpectedly, this region of TRAF6 is dimeric both in the crystal and in solution, different from the trimeric C-terminal TRAF domain. Structure-based mutagenesis reveals that TRAF6 dimerization is crucial for polyubiquitin synthesis and autoubiquitination.

The formulation of kinetic models of biochemical networks depends on knowledge of the kinetic properties of the enzymes of the individual reactions. However, kinetic data acquired from experimental observations bring along uncertainties due to various experimental conditions and measurement methods. In this contribution, we propose a novel way to model the uncertainty in the enzyme kinetics and to predict quantitatively the responses of metabolic reactions to the changes in enzyme activities under uncertainty. The proposed methodology accounts explicitly for mechanistic properties of enzymes and physico\u2010chemical and thermodynamic constraints, and is based on formalism from systems theory and metabolic control analysis. We achieve this by observing that kinetic responses of metabolic reactions depend: (i) on the distribution of the enzymes among their free form and all reactive states; (ii) on the equilibrium displacements of the overall reaction and that of the individual enzymatic steps; and (iii) on the net fluxes through the enzyme. Relying on this observation, we develop a novel, efficient Monte Carlo sampling procedure to generate all states within a metabolic reaction that satisfy imposed constrains. Thus, we derive the statistics of the expected responses of the metabolic reactions to changes in enzyme levels and activities, in the levels of metabolites, and in the values of the kinetic parameters. We present aspects of the proposed framework through an example of the fundamental three\u2010step reversible enzymatic reaction mechanism. We demonstrate that the equilibrium displacements of the individual enzymatic steps have an important influence on kinetic responses of the enzyme. Furthermore, we derive the conditions that must be satisfied by a reversible three\u2010step enzymatic reaction operating far away from the equilibrium in order to respond to changes in metabolite levels according to the irreversible Michelis\u2013Menten kinetics.

Yoga sessions consisted of 1.5 hours of supervised, standardized postures. Measures before and after training included maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force of the elbow flexors (EF) and knee extensors (KE), steadiness of isometric EF and KE contractions, steadiness of concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) KE contractions, and timed balance. The standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV, SD/mean force) of isometric force and the SD of acceleration during CON and ECC contractions were measured. After yoga training, MVC force increased 14% for KE (479 \u00b1 175 to 544 \u00b1 187 N, p < 0.05) and was unchanged for the EF muscles (219 \u00b1 85 to 230 \u00b1 72 N, p > 0.05). The CV of force was unchanged for EF (1.68 to 1.73%, p > 0.05) but was reduced in the KE muscles similarly for yoga and control groups (2.04 to 1.55%, p < 0.05). The variability of CON and ECC contractions was unchanged. For the yoga group, improvement in KE steadiness was correlated with pretraining steadiness (r = \u22120.62 to \u22120.84, p < 0.05); subjects with the greatest KE force fluctuations before training experienced the greatest reductions with training. Percent change in balance time for individual yoga subjects averaged +228% (19.5 \u00b1 14 to 34.3 \u00b1 18 seconds, p < 0.05), with no change in controls.

Visual feedback was provided (6-8 s) and then removed (6-8 s). After removal of drift (< 0.5 Hz) from the force, the standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) of force were calculated from vision and no-vision data.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMaximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force was 19% lower for elbow flexors and 37% lower for knee extensors in elderly adults than in young adults. Overall, the CV of force was 27% greater in the vision condition compared with the no-vision condition. The CV of force for vision was greater for elderly adults than for young adults at the 2.5% MVC target force and lower at 30 and 65% MVC. For the 2.5% MVC target force, the decline in CV of force from vision to no vision was greater for elderly adults than for young adults. At 30 and 65% MVC, the decline was significant but similar for young and elderly adults. For elbow flexors, the change in power from vision to no vision was greater for 0- to 4-Hz (reduced power) and 8- to 12-Hz (increased power) frequencies for elderly adults compared with young adults.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nVisuomotor correction contributed to force fluctuations in large proximal muscles. The contribution was greater for healthy elderly adults at low forces. Visuomotor processes thus contributed to the age-related increase in force fluctuations.", "citingTitle": "Yoga as Steadiness Training: Effects on Motor Variability in Young Adults", "citedTitle": "Aging, visuomotor correction, and force fluctuations in large muscles."}

The purpose of this study was to analyze the kinematics of one-on-one defensive movements in soccer competitions, and determine the relationships between lower limb kinematics and the center of mass translation during cutting actions. Six defensive scenes in which a player was responding to an offender\u2019s dribble attack were selected for analysis. To reconstruct the three-dimensional kinematics of the players, we used a photogrammetric model-based image-matching technique. The hip and knee kinematics were calculated from the matched skeleton model. In addition, the center of mass height was expressed as a ratio of each participant\u2019s body height. The relationships between the center of mass height and the kinematics were determined by the Pearson\u2019s product-moment correlation coefficient. The normalized center of mass height at initial contact was correlated with the vertical center of mass displacement (r = 0.832, p = 0.040) and hip flexion angle at initial contact (r = \u22120.823, p = 0.044). This suggests that the lower center of mass at initial contact is an important factor to reduce the downwards vertical center of mass translation during defensive cutting actions, and that this is executed primarily through hip flexion. It is therefore recommended that players land with an adequately flexed hip at initial contact during one-on-one cutting actions to minimize the vertical center of mass excursion.", "citedAbstract": "In many situations, e.g. sports injuries, three-dimensional kinematics cannot be obtained with traditional lab methods. However, if methods for reconstructing motion patterns from video sequences were available, our understanding of injury mechanisms could be improved. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new model-based image-matching technique for human motion reconstruction from one or more uncalibrated video sequences, using traditional motion analysis as a gold standard. A laboratory trial was conducted with one test subject performing jogging and side step cutting, while being filmed with three ordinary video cameras. This provided three single camera matchings, three double camera matchings and one triple camera matching for each of the motions. The test subject wore 33 reflective skin markers and was filmed with a seven-camera, 240 Hz motion analysis system. Root mean square (RMS) hip and knee flexion/extension angle differences were less than 12 degrees for all the matchings. Estimates for ad-/abduction (<15 degrees) and internal/external rotation (<16 degrees) were less precise. RMS velocity differences up to 0.62 m/s were found for the single camera matchings, but for the triple camera matching the RMS differences were less than 0.13 m/s for each direction. In conclusion, a new model-based image-matching technique has been developed, that can be used to estimate temporal joint angle histories, velocities and accelerations from uncalibrated video recordings. The kinematic estimates, in particular for center of mass velocity and acceleration, are clearly better when two or more camera views are available. This method can potentially be used to arrive at more precise descriptions of the mechanisms of sports injuries than what has been possible without elaborate methods for three-dimensional reconstruction from uncalibrated video sequences, e.g. for knee injuries.", "citingTitle": "Biomechanical Analysis of Defensive Cutting Actions During Game Situations: Six Cases in Collegiate Soccer Competitions", "citedTitle": "A model-based image-matching technique for three-dimensional reconstruction of human motion from uncalibrated video sequences."}

Although the importance of modeling such open-system magma chambers subject to energy conservation has been demonstrated, the effects of concurrent removal of magma by eruption and/or variable assimilation (involving imperfect extraction of anatectic melt from wall rock) have not been considered. In this study, we extend the EC-RAFC model to include the effects of Eruption and variable amounts of assimilation, Ax. This model, called EC-E 0RAcFC, tracks the compositions (trace elements and isotopes), temperatures, and masses of magma body liquid (melt), eruptive magma, cumulates and enclaves within a composite magmatic system undergoing simultaneous eruption, recharge, assimilation and fractional crystallization. The model is formulated as a set of 4 \u00fe t \u00fe i \u00fe s coupled nonlinear differential equations, where the number of trace elements, radiogenic and stable isotope ratios modeled are t, i and s, respectively. Solution of the ECE 0RAcFC equations provides values for the average temperature of wall rock (Ta), mass of melt within the magma body (Mm), masses of cumulates (Mct), enclaves (Men) and wall rock (M o a) and the masses of anatectic melt generated (M a ) and assimilated (cM a ). In addition, t trace element concentrations and i \u00fe s isotopic ratios in melt and eruptive magma (Cm, em, dm), cumulates (Cct, em, dm), enclaves (Cen, er , d o r ) and anatectic melt (Ca, ea, d o a) as a function of magma temperature (Tm) are also computed. Input parameters include the (user-defined) equilibration temperature (Teq), a factor describing the efficiency of addition of anatectic melt (c) from country rock to host magma, the initial temperature and composition of pristine host melt (Tom, C o m, em, d o m), recharge melt (T o r , C o r , er , dor ) and wall rock (T o a, C o a, ea, d o a), distribution coefficients (Dm, Dr, Da) and their temperature dependences (DHm, DHr, DHa), latent heats of transition (melting or crystallization) for wall rock (Dha), pristine magma (Dhm) and recharge magma (Dhr) as well as the isobaric specific heat capacity of assimilant (Cp,a), pristine (Cp,m) and recharge (Cp,r) melts. The magma recharge mass and eruptive magma mass functions,Mr(Tm) andMe(Tm), respectively, are specified a priori. Mr(Tm) and Me(Tm) are modeled as either continuous or episodic (step-like) processes. Melt productivity functions, which prescribe the relationship between melt mass fraction and temperature, are defined for end-member bulk compositions characterizing the local geologic site. EC-E 0RAcFC has potential for addressing fundamental questions in igneous petrology such as: What are intrusive to extrusive ratios (I/E) for particular magmatic systems, and how does this factor relate to rates of crustal growth? How does I/E vary temporally at single, long-lived magmatic centers? What system characteristics are most profoundly influenced by eruption?

The model accounts for the dependence of magma viscosity on crystallinity, temperature, and bulk composition; it includes latent heat effects and the effects of different initial water concentrations in the melt and quantitatively considers the role that large volumes of circulatory hydrothermal fluids play in dissipating heat. The nonlinear ordinary differential equation describing these processes has been solved for a variety of magma compositions, initial termperatures, initial crystallinities, volume ratios of hydrothermal fluid to magma, and pluton sizes. These calculations are graphically summarized in plots of the average magma temperature versus time after emplacement. Solidification times, defined as the time necessary for magma to cool from the initial emplacement temperature to the solidus temperature vary as R1,3, where R is the pluton radius. The solidification time of a pluton with a radius of 1 kilometer is 5 x 104 years; for an otherwise identical pluton with a radius of 10 kilometers, the solidification time is \u223c106 years. The water content has a marked effect on the solidification time. A granodiorite pluton with a radius of 5 kilometers and either 0.5 or 4 percent (by weight) water cools in 3.3 x 105 or 5 x 104 years, respectively.

Male Wistar rats were implanted with either one or two i.t. catheters for drug injection or pump infusion and with a microdialysis probe for CSF dialysate collection. The effect of acute GBP (10 microg i.t.) injection on the morphine dose response was examined in both na\u00efve rats and rats made tolerant by continuous infusion of morphine (15 microg/h i.t.) for 5 days.

In this study, we identified a putative protein phosphatase gene CPP1 in F. verticillioides, and investigated its role in FB(1) regulation. Previous work has shown that CPP1 expression is elevated in an FB(1)-suppressing genetic background. Thus, we hypothesized that CPP1 is negatively associated with FB(1) production. To test this hypothesis, we generated a CPP1 knockout mutant, PP179, and studied the effects of gene deletion on FB(1) biosynthesis and fungal development. PP179 showed elevated expression of FUM genes, and in turn produced higher levels of FB(1) than the wild-type progenitor. Other significant mutant phenotypes included reduced radial growth on agar plates, reduced conidia germination rates, significantly increased macroconidia formation, and hyphal swelling. To verify that these phenotypes were directly due to CPP1 deletion, we complemented PP179 with the wild-type CPP1 gene. The complemented strain PPC4 showed FUM1 expression and FB(1) production similar to that of the wild-type, providing evidence that CPP1 is negatively associated with FB(1) biosynthesis. Other PP179 phenotypes, such as macroconidiation and hyphal swelling, were also restored to that of wild-type progenitor. Furthermore, we complemented F. verticillioides PP179 strain with Neurospora crassa wild-type ppe-1 gene, demonstrating that Cpp1 and PPE-1 proteins are functionally conserved.

In contrast, a/alpha cells typically bud in a bipolar pattern, in which new buds can form at either pole of the cell. The BUD3 gene is specifically required for the axial pattern of budding: mutations of BUD3 (including a deletion) affect the axial pattern but not the bipolar pattern. The sequence of BUD3 predicts a product (Bud3p) of 1635 amino acids with no strong or instructive similarities to previously known proteins. However, immunofluorescence localization of Bud3p has revealed that it assembles in an apparent double ring encircling the mother-bud neck shortly after the mitotic spindle forms. The Bud3p structure at the neck persists until cytokinesis, when it splits to yield a single ring of Bud3p marking the division site on each of the two progeny cells. These single rings remain for much of the ensuing unbudded phase and then disassemble. The Bud3p rings are indistinguishable from those of the neck filament- associated proteins (Cdc3p, Cdc10p, Cdc11p, and Cdc12p), except that the latter proteins assemble before bud emergence and remain in place for the duration of the cell cycle. Upon shift of a temperature- sensitive cdc12 mutant to restrictive temperature, localization of both Bud3p and the neck filament-associated proteins is rapidly lost. In addition, a haploid cdc11 mutant loses its axial-budding pattern upon shift to restrictive temperature. Taken together, the data suggest that Bud3p and the neck filaments are linked in a cycle in which each controls the position of the other's assembly: Bud3p assembles onto the neck filaments in one cell cycle to mark the site for axial budding (including assembly of the new ring of neck filaments) in the next cell cycle. As the expression and localization of Bud3p are similar in a, alpha, and a/alpha cells, additional regulation must exist such that Bud3p restricts the position of bud formation in a and alpha cells but not in a/alpha cells.", "citingTitle": "Functional characterization of Fusarium verticillioides CPP1, a gene encoding a putative protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit.", "citedTitle": "Role of Bud3p in producing the axial budding pattern of yeast"}

In the FA pathway, assembly of 8 FA proteins including FANCA into a nuclear multiprotein complex, and the complex-dependent activation of FANCD2 are critical events for cellular tolerance against DNA cross-linkers. Hsp90 associates with FANCA, in vivo and in vitro, in a 17-AAG-sensitive manner. Disruption of the FANCA/Hsp90 association by cellular treatment with 17-AAG induces rapid proteasomal degradation and cytoplasmic relocalization of FANCA, leading to impaired activation of FANCD2. Furthermore, 17-AAG promotes DNA cross-linker-induced cytotoxicity, but this effect is much less pronounced in FA pathway-defective cells. Notably, 17-AAG enhances DNA cross-linker-induced chromosome aberrations. In conclusion, our results identify FANCA as a novel client of Hsp90, suggesting that Hsp90 promotes activation of the FA pathway through regulation of intracellular turnover and trafficking of FANCA, which is critical for cellular tolerance against genotoxic stress.", "citedAbstract": "Standing watch over the proteome, molecular chaperones are an ancient and evolutionarily conserved class of proteins that guide the normal folding, intracellular disposition and proteolytic turnover of many of the key regulators of cell growth, differentiation and survival.

Endothelial function of forearm resistance vessels was assessed by use of forearm vasodilatation to brachial artery administration of the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine. Conduit vessel endothelial function was assessed with flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery. Forearm resistance vessel dilatation to acetylcholine was significantly impaired 7 hours after methionine (methionine, 477+/-82%; placebo, 673+/-110%; P=0.016). Methionine did not alter vasodilatation to nitroprusside and verapamil.

These conditions were examined in four studies in which respondents evaluated general or specific benefits and risks of \"affect-rich\" and \"affect-poor\" hazards (ranging from investments to applications of stem cell research). In line with previous research, affect is defined as good or bad feelings integral to a stimulus. In contrast to previous research, affect is considered as related both to personal feelings and to social controversies associated with a hazard. Expertise is related to personal knowledge (laypersons vs. experts) as well as to objective knowledge (targets well vs. poorly known to science). The direct comparison of the input from personal and objective ignorance into the inverse relation has not been investigated previously. It was found that affect invoked by a hazard guides general but not specific judgments of its benefits and risks.

High-fat feeding is obesogenic, but the role of polyunsaturated fats is not well understood. This study examined the influence of different high-PUFA diets on serotonin-induced hypophagia, hypothalamic serotonin turnover, and hypothalamic protein levels of serotonin transporter (ST), and SR-1B and SR-2C receptors. Male Wistar rats received for 9\u00a0weeks from weaning a diet high in either soy oil or fish oil or low fat (control diet). Throughout 9\u00a0weeks, daily intake of fat diets decreased such that energy intake was similar to that of the control diet. However, the fish group developed heavier retroperitoneal and epididymal fat depots. After 12\u00a0h of either 200 or 300\u00a0\u03bcg intracerebroventricular serotonin, food intake was significantly inhibited in control group (21\u201325%) and soy group (37\u201339%) but not in the fish group. Serotonin turnover was significantly lower in the fish group than in both the control group (\u221213%) and the soy group (\u221218%). SR-2C levels of fish group were lower than those of control group (50%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and soy group (37%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.09).

Thus, unlike the soy-oil diet, the fish-oil diet decreased hypothalamic serotonin turnover and SR-2C levels and abolished serotonin-induced hypophagia. Fish-diet rats were potentially hypophagic, suggesting that, at least up to this point in its course, the serotonergic impairment was either compensated by other factors or not of a sufficient extent to affect feeding.

Upon weaning, the trans offspring continued on the trans diet (trans group) or were switched to a control diet (trans-control group).\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with control rats, trans rats had lower brain levels of eicosapentaenoic acid. Compared with trans rats, trans-control rats had increased levels of total polyunsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid and decreased levels of trans fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and monounsaturated fatty acids. Insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 levels were significantly lower (44% and 38%, respectively) in trans than in control rats. In trans-control rats, insulin receptor was 26% lower (P < 0.05), whereas insulin receptor substrate-1 was 50% lower, than in control rats.

Methods A total of 63 women (undergraduate students) ranging from 18 to 27 (20.7\u00b11.99) years old were included. Using the upper and lower quartile of a questionnaire assessing the daily difficulties in regulating emotions, two groups, one with low (LERD) and one with high (HERD) levels of emotion regulation difficulties, were constituted and studied during a film-elicited emotion procedure. Cardiac vagal activity (HF-HRV) was analyzed during three periods: baseline, film-elicited emotion, and recovery. Results The cardiovascular results showed a decrease in HF-HRV from baseline to elicitation for both groups. Then, from elicitation to recovery, HF-HRV increased for the LERD group, whereas a low HF-HRV level persisted for the HERD group. Conclusions The HERD group exhibited inappropriate cardiac vagal recovery after a negative emotion elicitation had ended. Cardiac vagal tone took longer to return to its initial state in the HERD group than in the LERD group.

Letter strings consisted of six target letters under low load and one target letter and five nontarget letters under high load. With fearful distractors, lower tonic HRV was associated with phasic HRV suppression, suggesting an autonomic stress response under both low and high load. In contrast, higher tonic HRV was associated with phasic HRV enhancement, suggesting greater self-regulatory effort under low load and an absence of phasic HRV suppression under high load.

The placenta does a series of remarkable things, including implanting the embryo in the uterus, negotiating with the mother for nutrients but also protecting her health during pregnancy, helping establish normal metabolic and cardiovascular function for life postnatally (developmental programming) and initiating changes that prepare the mother to care for and suckle her young after birth. Different lines of evidence in experimental animals suggest that the development and function of the placenta are adaptable. This means that some of the changes observed in pathological pregnancies may represent attempts to mitigate the impact of fetal growth and development. Key and emerging concepts are reviewed here concerning how we may view the placenta diagnostically and therapeutically in pregnancy complications, focusing on information from experimental studies in mice, sheep and cattle, as well as association studies from humans.

The fetal to placental weight ratio is thus increased in the absence of the P0 transcript. We show that passive permeability for nutrients of the mutant placenta is decreased, but that secondary active placental amino acid transport is initially upregulated, compensating for the decrease in passive permeability. Later the compensation fails and fetal growth restriction ensues. Our study provides experimental evidence for imprinted gene action in the placenta that directly controls the supply of maternal nutrients to the fetus, and supports the genetic conflict theory of imprinting.

Here, we identify the AP1 transcription factor as a critical target of HDAC4 in neurogenic muscle atrophy. In denervated muscle, HDAC4 activates AP1-dependent transcription, whereas AP1 inactivation recapitulates HDAC4 deficiency and blunts the muscle atrophy program. We show that HDAC4 activates AP1 independently of its canonical transcriptional repressor activity. Surprisingly, HDAC4 stimulates AP1 activity by activating the MAP kinase cascade. We present evidence that HDAC4 binds and promotes the deacetylation and activation of a key MAP3 kinase, MEKK2.

Deletion of myogenin from adult mice diminishes expression of MuRF1 and atrogin-1 in denervated muscle and confers resistance to atrophy. Mice lacking histone deacetylases (HDACs) 4 and 5 in skeletal muscle fail to upregulate myogenin and also preserve muscle mass following denervation. Conversely, forced expression of myogenin in skeletal muscle of HDAC mutant mice restores muscle atrophy following denervation.

These posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like symptoms are frequently observed in persons with chronic pain syndromes. Little is known about how these two phenomena interact with one another. The present study evaluated PTSD-like symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and examined the relation between PTSD-like symptoms and problems associated with FMS.\n\n\nDESIGN\nNinety-three consecutive patients underwent a comprehensive FMS evaluation and completed self-report questionnaires measuring PTSD-like symptoms, disability, and psychosocial responses to their pain condition. Subjects were divided in two groups based on level of self-reported PTSD-like symptoms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nApproximately 56% of the sample reported clinically significant levels of PTSD-like symptoms (PTSD+). The PTSD+ patients reported significantly greater levels of pain (p < 0.01), emotional distress (p < 0.01), life interference (p < 0.01), and disability (p < 0.01) than did the patients without clinically significant levels of PTSD-like symptoms (PTSD-). Over 85% of the PTSD+ patients compared with 50% of the PTSD- patients demonstrated significant disability. Based on response to the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, a significantly smaller percentage of PTSD+ patients were classified as adaptive copers (15%) compared with the PTSD- group (48.2%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nResults suggest that PTSD-like symptoms are prevalent in FMS patients and may influence adaptation to this chronic illness.

Primary infection only leads to self-limited dengue fever. But secondary infection with another serotype carries a higher risk of increased disease severity, causing life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Serotype cross-reactive antibodies facilitate DENV infection in Fc-receptor-bearing cells by promoting virus entry via Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3R), a process known as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). Most studies suggested that enhancing antibodies were mainly specific to the structural premembrane protein (prM) of DENV. However, there is still no effective drugs or vaccines to prevent ADE. In this study, we firstly confirmed that both DENV-2 infected human sera (anti-DENV-2) and DENV-2 prM monoclonal antibody (prM mAb) could significantly enhance DENV-1 infection in K562 cells. Then we developed anti-idiotypic antibodies (prM-AIDs) specific to prM mAb by immunizing of Balb/c mice. Results showed that these polyclonal antibodies can dramatically reduce ADE phenomenon of DENV-1 infection in K562 cells. To further confirm the anti-ADE effect of prM-AIDs in vivo, interferon-\u03b1 and \u03b3 receptor-deficient mice (AG6) were used as the mouse model for DENV infection. We found that administration of DENV-2 prM mAb indeed caused a higher DENV-1 titer as well as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and alaninea minotransferase (ALT) in mice infected with DENV-1, similar to clinical ADE symptoms.

Of note, the number of platelets in peripheral blood of prM-AIDs group were significantly increased at day 3 post infection with DENV-1 compared that of prM-mAb group.

The DENV2-mediated lysis and clearance of platelets were abrogated in presence of platelet activation inhibitor, prostacyclin.

While electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) have been used for such determinations, their results serve at best as proxies for the RBP activities in living cells. Here, we describe a quantitative dual fluorescence method to analyze protein-mRNA interactions in vivo. Known or candidate RBPs are fused to fluorescent proteins (eGFP, YFP), expressed in cells, cross-linked in vivo to RNA by ultraviolet light irradiation, and immunoprecipitated, after lysis, with a single chain antibody fragment directed against eGFP (GFP-binding protein, GBP). Polyadenylated RNA-binding activity of fusion proteins is assessed by hybridization with an oligo(DT) probe coupled with a red fluorophore. Since UV light is directly applied to living cells, the assay can be used to monitor dynamic changes in RNA-binding activities in response to biological or pharmacological stimuli. Notably, immunoprecipitation and hybridization can also be performed with commercially available GBP-coupled 96-well plates (GFP-multiTrap), allowing highly parallel RNA-binding measurements in a single experiment.

It builds a user's profile as her historically interacted items, recommending new items that are similar to the user's profile. As such, the key to an item-based CF method is in the estimation of item similarities. Early approaches use statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Pearson coefficient to estimate item similarities, which are less accurate since they lack tailored optimization for the recommendation task. In recent years, several works attempt to learn item similarities from data, by expressing the similarity as an underlying model and estimating model parameters by optimizing a recommendation-aware objective function. While extensive efforts have been made to use shallow linear models for learning item similarities, there has been relatively less work exploring nonlinear neural network models for item-based CF. In this work, we propose a neural network model named Neural Attentive Item Similarity model (NAIS) for item-based CF. The key to our design of NAIS is an attention network, which is capable of distinguishing which historical items in a user profile are more important for a prediction. Compared to the state-of-the-art item-based CF method Factored Item Similarity Model (FISM)\u00a0[1] , our NAIS has stronger representation power with only a few additional parameters brought by the attention network.

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.", "citingTitle": "Modifications of Machine Translation Evaluation Metrics by Using Word Embeddings", "citedTitle": "A Neural Probabilistic Language Model"}

However, it is not clear that an arms race analogy is appropriate in this context because there is no published evidence for rapid evolution in genes that might confer toxin resistance among routinely envenomed species. Here we report such evidence from an unusual predator-prey relationship between opossums (Marsupialia: Didelphidae) and pitvipers (Serpentes: Crotalinae). In particular, we found high ratios of replacement to silent substitutions in the gene encoding von Willebrand Factor (vWF), a venom-targeted hemostatic blood protein, in a clade of opossums known to eat pitvipers and to be resistant to their hemorrhagic venom. Observed amino-acid substitutions in venom-resistant opossums include changes in net charge and hydrophobicity that are hypothesized to weaken the bond between vWF and one of its toxic snake-venom ligands, the C-type lectin-like protein botrocetin. Our results provide the first example of rapid adaptive evolution in any venom-targeted molecule, and they support the notion that an evolutionary arms race might be driving the rapid evolution of snake venoms. However, in the arms race implied by our results, venomous snakes are prey, and their venom has a correspondingly defensive function in addition to its usual trophic role.", "citedAbstract": "The ligand binding site of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR) is localized in the alpha-subunit within a domain containing the tandem Cys-192 and -193. By analyzing the binding-site region of AcChoR from animal species that are resistant to alpha-neurotoxins, we have previously shown that four residues in this region, at positions 187, 189, 194, and 197, differ between animals sensitive (e.g., mouse) and resistant (e.g., mongoose and snake) to alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX). In the present study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on a fragment of the mongoose AcChoR alpha-subunit (residues 122-205) and exchanged residues 187, 189, 194, and 197, either alone or in combination, with those present in the mouse alpha-subunit sequence. Only the mongoose fragment in which all four residues were mutated to the mouse ones exhibited alpha-BTX binding similar to that of the mouse fragment. The mongoose double mutation in which Leu-194 and His-197 were replaced with proline residues, which are present at these positions in the mouse AcChoR and in all other toxin binders, bound alpha-BTX to approximately 60% of the level of binding exhibited by the mouse fragment. In addition, replacement of either Pro-194 or -197 in the mouse fragment with serine and histidine, respectively, markedly decreased alpha-BTX binding. All other mutations resulted in no or just a small increase in alpha-BTX binding. These results have led us to propose two subsites in the binding domain for alpha-BTX: the proline subsite, which includes Pro-194 and -197 and is critical for alpha-BTX binding, and the aromatic subsite, which includes amino acid residues 187 and 189 and determines the extent of alpha-BTX binding.", "citingTitle": "Adaptive Evolution of the Venom-Targeted vWF Protein in Opossums that Eat Pitvipers", "citedTitle": "Two subsites in the binding domain of the acetylcholine receptor: an aromatic subsite and a proline subsite."}

In Ca\u2010free medium responses to 5\u2010HT were enhanced, those to DMPP depressed and those to GABA unchanged. In Mg\u2010free medium responses to 5\u2010HT were unchanged, while those to DMPP and GABA were depressed. Removal of both Ca and Mg from the superfusion medium caused a small reduction of GABA responses and a large reduction of DMPP responses. Responses to 5\u2010HT were not only greatly potentiated but were changed in character; the depolarizing phase became sigmoid and the dose dependence between quantity of 5\u2010HT and response magnitude was lost as if 5\u2010HT were triggering an all\u2010or\u2010nothing phenomenon.

Differences in lifestyles in society can partly be understood through the differences in the social and physical environment. This study examines the relationships between reported physical activity, and the extent of perceived support for physical activity in the physical and policy environment (e.g. facilities, programmes and other opportunities), and in the social environment. The data for the study come from a cross-cultural health policy study called MAREPS. In total, 3342 adults, 18 years or older, from six countries (Belgium, Finland, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland) were interviewed via telephone. Respondents were categorised as active or inactive according to self-reported physical activity. Social environmental factors and physical and policy environmental factors were also assessed. The analysis of the data was informed by social cognitive theory, although the study was not originally designed for this purpose. Sixty-eight percent of females and 70% of males were active. The proportions of active and inactive varied by countries to a great extent. The strongest independent predictor of being physically active was social environment. Those who perceived low social support from their personal environment (i.e. family, friends, school and workplace) were more than twice as likely to be sedentary compared to those who reported high social support from their personal environment. Specific knowledge of the programmes and actions for physical activity and sport was also a strong predictor of being active. A supportive physical and policy environment was not associated with participation in physical activity as strongly as had been anticipated.

The budding yeast CST complex, comprising Cdc13, Stn1, and Ctc1, is critical for telomere replication, length regulation, and end protection. Although mammalian homologues of CST have been identified recently, their role and function for telomere maintenance in normal somatic human cells are still incompletely understood. Here, we characterize the function of human Stn1 in cultured human fibroblasts and demonstrate its critical role in telomere replication, length regulation, and function. In the absence of high telomerase activity, shRNA\u2010mediated knockdown of hStn1 resulted in aberrant and fragile telomeric structures, stochastic telomere attrition, increased telomere erosion rates, telomere dysfunction, and consequently accelerated entry into cellular senescence. Oxidative stress augmented the defects caused by Stn1 knockdown leading to almost immediate cessation of cell proliferation. In contrast, overexpression of hTERT suppressed some of the defects caused by hStn1 knockdown suggesting that telomerase can partially compensate for hStn1 loss.

The rate of virologic non-response (HBV DNA reduction <1 log(10) IU/ml at 6 months) was significantly greater in the LAM+ADV than in the ETV group (51.2% vs. 16.0%, p<0.01).

In particular, we use a set of parameters to represent a particular class of MRs, which we refer to as polynomial MRs, and turn the problem of inferring MRs into a problem of searching for suitable values of the parameters. We then dynamically analyze multiple executions of the program, and use particle swarm optimization to solve the search problem. To improve the quality of inferred MRs, we further use MR filtering to remove some inferred MRs. We also conducted three empirical studies to evaluate our approach using four scientific libraries (including 189 scientific functions).

Induction of myostatin expression was observed in rodent models of muscle wasting and in cachectic patients with cancer or pulmonary disease. Therefore, there is an increasing interest to use serum myostatin as a biomarker. Methods We established an immunoradiometric sandwich assay (IRMA), which uses a commercially available chicken polyclonal, affinity purified antibody directed against human myostatin prodomain. We determined the serum concentrations of myostatin prodomain in 249 healthy individuals as well as 169 patients with heart failure, 53 patients with cancer and 44 patients with chronic pulmonary disease.

Although several humoral proteins, namely TNF\u03b1 (tumour necrosis factor \u03b1) and IL (interleukin)-6, have been shown to induce skeletal muscle wasting, there is a lack of information regarding the tumoral factors that contribute to the atrophy of muscle during cancer cachexia. Therefore, in the present study, we have characterized the secretome of C26 colon cancer cells to identify the tumoral factors involved in cancer-induced skeletal muscle wasting. In the present study, we show that myostatin, a procachectic TGF\u03b2 (transforming growth factor \u03b2) superfamily member, is abundantly secreted by C26 cells. Consistent with myostatin signalling during cachexia, treating differentiated C2C12 myotubes with C26 CM (conditioned medium) resulted in myotubular atrophy due to the up-regulation of muscle-specific E3 ligases, atrogin-1 and MuRF1 (muscle RING-finger protein 1), and enhanced activity of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway. Furthermore, the C26 CM also activated ActRIIB (activin receptor type II B)/Smad and NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor \u03baB) signalling, and reduced the activity of the IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor 1)/PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt pathway, three salient molecular features of myostatin action in skeletal muscles. Antagonists to myostatin prevented C26 CM-induced wasting in muscle cell cultures, further confirming that tumoral myostatin may be a key contributor in the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia.

Glucose uptake by some members of the GLUT family, mainly GLUT1, is inhibited by flavonoids, the natural polyphenols present in fruits, vegetables and wine. Therefore it is of interest to establish if these polyphenolic compounds present in the diet, known to be effective antioxidants but also endowed with several other biological activities such as protein-tyrosine kinase inhibition, interfere with GLUT4 function. In the present study, we show that three flavonoids, quercetin, myricetin and catechin-gallate, inhibit the uptake of methylglucose by adipocytes over the concentration range of 10-100 microM. These three flavonoids show a competitive pattern of inhibition, with K(i)=16, 33.5 and 90 microM respectively. In contrast, neither catechin nor gallic acid inhibit methylglucose uptake. To obtain a better understanding of the interaction among GLUT4 and flavonoids, we have derived a GLUT4 three-dimensional molecular comparative model, using structural co-ordinates from a GLUT3 comparative model and a mechanosensitive ion channel [PDB (Protein Data Bank) code 1MSL] solved by X-ray diffraction. On the whole, the experimental evidence and computer simulation data favour a transport inhibition mechanism in which flavonoids and GLUT4 interact directly, rather than by a mechanism related to protein-tyrosine kinase and insulin signalling inhibition. Furthermore, the results suggest that GLUT transporters are involved in flavonoid incorporation into cells.", "citingTitle": "Quercetin is equally or more effective than resveratrol in attenuating tumor necrosis factor-{alpha}-mediated inflammation and insulin resistance in primary human adipocytes.", "citedTitle": "Myricetin, quercetin and catechin-gallate inhibit glucose uptake in isolated rat adipocytes."}

However, little is known about mechanisms underlying the conversion from oxidative signaling to downstream activities leading cells to death. Methodology/Principal Findings We here report a systematic detection of transcriptome changes in response to oxidative signals generated in leukemia cells upon fenretinide treatment, implicating the occurrence of numerous stress-responsive events during the fenretinide induced apoptosis, such as redox response, endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response, translational repression and proteasome activation. Moreover, the configuration of these relevant events is primarily orchestrated by stress responsive transcription factors, as typically highlighted by NF-E2-related factor-2 (NRF2) and heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Several lines of evidence suggest that the coordinated regulation of these transcription factors and thus their downstream genes are involved in converting oxidative signaling into downstream stress-responsive events regulating pro-apoptotic and apoptotic activities at the temporal and spatial levels, typifying oxidative stress-mediated programmed death rather than survival in cancer cells.

Moreover, in rodents, sleep bouts exhibit an exponential distribution at all ages examined, whereas wake bout durations exhibit exponential distributions early in ontogeny with a clear power-law emerging only at the older ages. Thus, the data examined thus far suggests a similar developmental trajectory for a wide range of mammals which in turn may offer a novel metric to directly compare human and animal sleep\u2013wake data. Therefore, we tested the generalizability of these findings by examining the distributions of sleep and wake bouts during the night in a healthy human sample \u2013 from premature infants to 70-year-olds.

The findings reinforce the idea, emerging from a complexity perspective on agricultural innovation systems, that interaction between innovation networks and their environment is only steerable to a limited extent. Nonetheless, innovation networks can enhance effective reformism by creating tangible visions that serve as vehicles to create understanding about the innovation and mobilize support for it, and by employing several kinds of boundary spanning individuals that are able to forge effective connections between innovation networks and their environment. Because innovation networks can only partially influence their institutional environment, and because unintended consequences of actions and random events influence the course of the innovation process, innovation network actors need to continuously re-interpret the contexts in which they move. This constant reflection by the innovating actors on their position vis-a-vis their environment needs to be supported by dedicated facilitators and monitoring and evaluation methods aimed at system learning.

The LV end-diastolic chamber stiffness (slope of the linearized LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship) was also decreased in the exercised group (P < 0.05). The decreased chamber stiffness occurred as a consequence of a decrease in the regional myocardial wall elastic stiffness (slope of the linearized LV end-diastolic stress-strain relationship; P < 0.05).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\u2014GLP-1\u2013induced changes in [Ca2+]i were measured in \u03b2-cells isolated from Cd38+/+ and Cd38\u2212/\u2212 mice. Calcium-mobilizing second messengers were identified by measuring levels of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) and cyclic ADP-ribose (ADPR), using a cyclic enzymatic assay. To locate NAADP- and cyclic ADPR\u2013producing enzyme(s), cellular organelles were separated using the sucrose gradient method. RESULTS\u2014A GLP-1\u2013induced [Ca2+]i increase showed a cooperative Ca2+ signal, i.e., an initial [Ca2+]i rise mediated by the action of NAADP that was produced in acidic organelles and a subsequent long-lasting increase of [Ca2+]i by the action of cyclic ADPR that was produced in plasma membranes and secretory granules. GLP-1 sequentially stimulated production of NAADP and cyclic ADPR in the organelles through protein kinase A and cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor II. Furthermore, the results showed that NAADP production from acidic organelles governed overall Ca2+ signals, including insulin secretion by GLP-1, and that in addition to CD38, enzymes capable of synthesizing NAADP and/or cyclic ADPR were present in \u03b2-cells.

Most of the trackers can not work well, especially when dealing with problems such as similarly colored backgrounds, object occlusions, low illumination, or sudden illumination changes in real scenes. A centroid iteration algorithm using multiple features and a posterior probability criterion is presented to solve these problems. The model representation of the object and the similarity measure are two key factors that greatly influence the performance of the tracker. Firstly, this paper propose using a local texture feature which is a generalization of the local binary pattern (LBP) descriptor, which we call the double center-symmetric local binary pattern (DCS-LBP). This feature shows great discrimination between similar regions and high robustness to noise. By analyzing DCS-LBP patterns, a simplified DCS-LBP is used to improve the object texture model called the SDCS-LBP. The SDCS-LBP is able to describe the primitive structural information of the local image such as edges and corners. Then, the SDCS-LBP and the color are combined to generate the multiple features as the target model. Secondly, a posterior probability measure is introduced to reduce the rate of matching mistakes. Three strategies of target model update are employed. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is effective in improving tracking performance in complicated real scenarios compared with some state-of-the-art methods.", "citedAbstract": "Template matching is one of the principle techniques in visual tracking. Various similarity measures have been developed to find the target in an acquired image by matching with a template. However, mismatching or misidentification may sporadically occur due to the influence of the background pixels included in the designated target model. Taking into account the statistical features of a search region, a novel similarity measure is proposed, which can decrease the interference of the background pixels enclosed in the model. It highlights the significant target features and at the same time reduces the influence of the features shared by both the target and the background. It exhibits an excellent monotonic property and a distinct peak-like distribution. This new measure is also demonstrated to have a direct interpretation of posterior probability and is named as posterior probability measure (PPM). The proposed PPM can be obtained through a pixel-wise computation and exhibits suitability for image matching. The pixel-wise computation also enables a fast measure update after a target region has changed, which results in a new adaptive scaling method for tracking a target with a varying size. Experiments show that it provides a higher precision in the localization and a discriminatory power superior to the existing similarity measures, such as Bhattacharyya coefficient, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and normalized cross correlation.

Blocking mTORC1 prior to growth prevented clonal expansion, whereas blockade after cells reached peak size had little to no effect. Conversely, constitutively active mTORC1 led to DZ enrichment but loss of competitiveness and impaired affinity maturation.

Because PAECs but not PASMCs synthesize serotonin, and serotonin can pass through gap junctions, we hypothesized that the monoamine is the intercellular signal. We aimed to determine whether PAEC-derived serotonin mediates PAEC-induced myoendothelial gap junction-dependent activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and differentiation of PASMCs. Rat PAECs and PASMCs were monocultured or cocultured with (touch) or without (no-touch) direct cell-cell contact. In all cases, tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1) transcripts were expressed predominantly in PAECs.

Furthermore, inhibition of gap junctions but not of the serotonin transporter in PAEC/PASMC touch coculture prevented serotonin transfer from PAECs to PASMCs. Inhibition of serotonin synthesis pharmacologically or by small interfering RNAs to Tph1 in PAECs inhibited the PAEC-induced activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and differentiation of PASMCs.

Rat PAECs and PASMCs were cocultured on opposite sides of a porous Transwell membrane that permitted formation of heterotypic cell-cell contacts. Immunostaining showed expression of the gap junctional protein connexin 43 (Cx43) on projections extending into the membrane from both cell types.

We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes).

This study developed a novel flume to characterize swimming behavior of barnacle cyprids in a laboratory downwelling flow. Seawater was pumped through a cylindrical observation chamber fitted with diffusers to produce a homogeneous down- welling velocity field. The flume generated plug flow with mean downwelling velocities (indicated by negative sign) of 0 to -47.3 mm s -1 . Behavior experiments were done with wild Semibalanus bal- anoides cyprids. Vertical swimming rates and behaviors were estimated from video observations, and a mixture model was used to estimate velocity distributions for distinct behavioral modes. Larvae exhibited multiple behaviors but typically swam upward in response to downwelling, with a maxi- mum estimated vertical velocity of 72.3 mm s -1 . When faced with downwelling flows, cyprids alter- nated between upward swimming and downward swimming to maintain their vertical position in the chamber. As downwelling velocities increased, cyprids that remained in the field of view of the cam- eras exhibited faster mean upward swimming velocities. It is unclear how long individual S. bal- anoides cyprids can maintain depth, but cyprids were able to maintain depth throughout the 2 min observation period. This study supports earlier hypotheses based on field observations by demon- strating that S. balanoides cyprids swim well enough to counter downwelling velocities characteris- tic of convergence zones. Swimming against downwelling flow could be an adaptive behavior that enables shoreward transport in the absence of any larval ability to swim toward shore or even to sense its direction.", "citedAbstract": "Field observations imply that accumulation and advection of invertebrate larvae and other plankton by propagating fronts provides an efficient mechanism for the cross-shelf transport and subsequent coastal settlement of larvae and plankton. Gravity currents propagating into a heavier, uniform-density fluid are known to have near-surface velocities u that exceed the propagation speed c of the gravity current nose. It is shown by simple dam-break laboratory experiments and through corresponding numerical solutions of two-dimensional stratified flow and Lagrangian particle advection that this characteristic of gravity currents can lead to accumulation in the gravity current nose of particles that originate well behind the gravity current head. However, efficient particle accumulation and transport with the speed c only occurs for particles with sufficient vertical buoyancy or vertical swimming capability. Weakly buoyant or neutral particles are swept down and back away from the gravity current head by the circulation in this region. A dam break into an ambient fluid with stratification (two-layered) could result in the transport of some particles that are initially trapped in the forepart of the leading disturbance, an undular bore. However, this situation does not result in significant accumulation of particles at the leading edge of the disturbance. The numerical solutions show that particles that originate in the dense fluid ahead of the gravity current are much less likely to be accumulated at the gravity current nose. A simple scaling criterion for the minimum vertical buoyancy velocity for efficient accumulation and transport of buoyant particles based on the gravity current and particle characteristics is developed and compares favorably with the numerical results. The implications of these results for transport of larvae in coastal environments are discussed. The dynamics of marine benthic invertebrate populations are greatly affected by larval transport. For near-shore populations, larval transport prior to settlement includes at least three processes: cross-shore advection, because larvae are generally very small and cannot control their cross-shore position by swimming alone; larval behavior, because by swimming vertically, larvae might be able to exploit some depth-dependent cross-shore flows; and accumulation by convergent circulation in propagating features, because cross-shore advection of larvae is often dependent on the retention of larvae at the propagating features. Several hypotheses of onshore larval transport, namely surface slicks over linear internal waves (Shanks 1983), internal bore warm fronts (Pineda 1994), and upwelling relaxation fronts (Farrell et al. 1991), invoke concentration of larvae at propagating features. These hypotheses state that larvae become concentrated at convergent features aligned parallel to the coastline and that larval transport occurs as these linear features propagate shoreward. The interplay between transport and accumulation is poorly understood; issues include (1) the dependency of transport on accumulation, and of accumulation on larval behavior, and (2) whether the frontal larvae originate onshore or off", "citingTitle": "Swimming behavior and velocities of barnacle cyprids in a downwelling flume", "citedTitle": "Accumulation of particles in propagating fronts"}

In this study, we sought to understand the influence of multiaccess infusion device properties (dead space volume and antireflux valve [ARV]) on drug delivery during multi-infusion therapy. METHODS: Infusion sets differing in length, dead space volume, and presence of an ARV were assessed. Three drugs were infused simultaneously through different access points, and their concentrations were obtained using UV spectrophotometric analysis of the effluent. Different infusion configurations were compared by assessing (1) the amount of drug delivered to the patient per unit of time, (2) the mean amount of drug delivered to the patient per unit of time during the steady-state infusion (mass flow rate plateau), and (3) flow change efficiency calculated from the ratio of the area under the experimental instant mass flow rate curve to the area corresponding to theoretical instant mass flow rate curve. RESULTS: Infusion sets with lower dead space volumes offered significantly higher flow change efficiency (53.0% \u00b1 15.4% with a dead space volume equal to 0.046 mL 5 min after the start of infusion) than infusion sets with higher dead space volume (5.6% \u00b1 8.2% with a dead space volume equal to 6.16 mL), whatever the flow rate changes. Even in case of large dead space volumes, the presence of an ARV significantly increased the mass flow rate plateau (from 92.4% to 99.3% of the theoretical plateau without and with the presence of an ARV, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Multi-infusion therapy induces perturbation in drug delivery. These perturbations (lag time, backflow, and bolus) could be reduced by using infusion sets including very low dead space volume and an ARV.", "citingTitle": "Impact of physical incompatibility on drug mass flow rates: example of furosemide-midazolam incompatibility", "citedTitle": "Impact of Multiaccess Infusion Devices on In Vitro Drug Delivery During Multi-Infusion Therapy"}

CELF1 levels peak in the heart during embryogenesis, and aberrant up-regulation of CELF1 in the adult heart has been implicated in cardiac pathogenesis in myotonic dystrophy type 1, as well as in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Either inhibition of CELF activity or over-expression of CELF1 in heart muscle causes cardiomyopathy in transgenic mice. Nonetheless, many of the cardiac targets of CELF1 regulation remain unknown. In this study, to identify cardiac targets of CELF1 we performed cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) for CELF1 from embryonic day 8 chicken hearts. We identified a previously unannotated exon in MYH7B as a novel target of CELF1-mediated regulation. We demonstrated that knockdown of CELF1 in primary chicken embryonic cardiomyocytes leads to increased inclusion of this exon and decreased MYH7B levels. We also investigated global changes in the transcriptome of primary embryonic cardiomyocytes following CELF1 knockdown in a published RNA-seq dataset. Pathway and network analyses identified strong associations between CELF1 and regulation of cell cycle and translation.

In vivo optical imaging studies in SCA8 mice confirm that Gabt4 upregulation is associated with the predicted loss of GABAergic inhibition within the granular cell layer. These data demonstrate that CUGexp transcripts dysregulate MBNL/CELF regulated pathways in the brain and provide mechanistic insight into the CNS effects of other CUGexp disorders.

Rituximab serum concentrations were measured after s.c. coadministration with nonspecific IgG and hyaluronidase to rats. Several dose levels and different injection sites were evaluated.

For this purpose, it is necessary to have a similarity measure that reflects the underpinning molecular interactions and biological pathways. We have thus devised a network-based measure that can partially fulfill this goal. Our method assigns weights to all proteins (and consequently their encoding genes) by using information flow from a disease to the protein interaction network and back. Similarity between two diseases is then defined as the cosine of the angle between their corresponding weight vectors. The proposed method also provides a way to suggest disease-pathway associations by using the weights assigned to the genes to perform enrichment analysis for each disease. By calculating pairwise similarities between 2534 diseases, we show that our disease similarity measure is strongly correlated with the probability of finding the diseases in the same disease family and, more importantly, sharing biological pathways. We have also compared our results to those of MimMiner, a text-mining method that assigns pairwise similarity scores to diseases. We find the results of the two methods to be complementary. It is also shown that clustering diseases based on their similarities and performing enrichment analysis for the cluster centers significantly increases the term association rate, suggesting that the cluster centers are better representatives for biological pathways than the diseases themselves. This lends support to the view that our similarity measure is a good indicator of relatedness of biological processes involved in causing the diseases.

While many other network analysis methods based on random walks or equivalent notions have been developed before and after our earlier work, one can show that they can all be mapped to one of the two modes. In addition to these two fundamental modes, a major strength of our earlier formalism was its accommodation of context-specific directed information flow that yielded plausible and meaningful biological interpretation of protein functions and pathways. However, the directed flow from origins to destinations was induced via a potential function that was heuristic. Here, with a theoretically sound approach called the channel mode, we extend our earlier work for directed information flow. This is achieved by constructing a potential function facilitating a purely probabilistic interpretation of the channel mode. For each network node, the channel mode combines the solutions of emitting and absorbing modes in the same context, producing what we call a channel tensor. The entries of the channel tensor at each node can be interpreted as the amount of flow passing through that node from an origin to a destination. Similarly to our earlier model, the channel mode encompasses damping as a free parameter that controls the locality of information flow. Through examples involving the yeast pheromone response pathway, we illustrate the versatility and stability of our new framework.", "citingTitle": "Relating Diseases by Integrating Gene Associations and Information Flow through Protein Interaction Network", "citedTitle": "Information Flow in Interaction Networks II: Channels, Path Lengths, and Potentials"}

Reproductive character displacement, or increased divergence of reproductive characters in areas where closely related species overlap, is often a consequence of reinforcement and has been shown to be present in one Indo-Pacific species of the genus Echinometra. In the Atlantic species of the same genus, positive selection has been shown to act on bindin of Echinometra lucunter. To examine whether the source of this selection is reinforcement, we determined variation on the first exon of bindin in E. lucunter in the Caribbean, where it is sympatric with Echinometra viridis, and in the rest of the Atlantic, where E. viridis is absent. There was no differentiation between bindin sequences from the two geographic regions; similar levels of positive selection were found to be acting in both areas. The similarities were not due to gene flow; mitochondrial DNA from the two regions indicates that E. lucunter populations most likely originated in the Atlantic and have not exchanged genes with Caribbean populations for approximately 200,000 years. The lack of evidence of stronger selection on bindin of E. lucunter in areas of sympatry with its sister species suggests that the source of selection is not reinforcement.

The present study analyzes bindin polymorphism and divergence in the three closely related species of Echinometra in Central America: E. lucunter and E. viridis from the Caribbean, and E. vanbrunti from the eastern Pacific. The eggs of E. lucunter have evolved a strong block to fertilization by sperm of its neotropical congeners, whereas those of the other two species have not. As in the Indo-West Pacific (IWP) Echinometra, the neotropical species show high intraspecific bindin polymorphism in the same gene regions as in the IWP species. Maximum likelihood analysis shows that many of the polymorphic codon sites are under mild positive selection. Of the fixed amino acid replacements, most have accumulated along the bindin lineage of E. lucunter. We analyzed the data with maximum likelihood models of variation in positive selection across lineages and codon sites, and with models that consider sites and lineages simultaneously. Our results show that positive selection is concentrated along the E. lucunter bindin lineage, and that codon sites with amino acid replacements fixed in this species show by far the highest signal of positive selection. Lineage-specific positive selection paralleling egg incompatibility provides support that adaptive evolution of sperm proteins acts to maintain recognition of bindin by changing egg receptors. Because both egg incompatibility and bindin divergence are greater between allopatric species than between sympatric species, the hypothesis of selection against hybridization (reinforcement) cannot explain why adaptive evolution has been confined to a single lineage in the American Echinometra. Instead, processes acting to varying degrees within species (e.g., sperm competition, sexual selection, and sexual conflict) are more promising explanations for lineage-specific positive selection on bindin.", "citingTitle": "Lack of character displacement in the male recognition molecule, bindin, in Altantic sea urchins of the genus Echinometra.", "citedTitle": "Adaptive evolution of sperm bindin tracks egg incompatibility in neotropical sea urchins of the genus Echinometra."}

Although many of these studies have been conducted in manufacturing, similar findings of a positive correlation between aspects of HPWS and improved care delivery and patient outcomes have been reported in international health care studies. The purpose of this paper is to bring together the results from a series of studies conducted within Australian health care organisations. First, the authors seek to demonstrate the link found between high performance work systems and organisational performance, including the perceived quality of patient care. Second, the paper aims to show that the hospitals studied do not have the necessary aspects of HPWS in place and that there has been little consideration of HPWS in health system reform.\n\n\nDESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH\nThe paper draws on a series of correlation studies using survey data from hospitals in Australia, supplemented by qualitative data collection and analysis. To demonstrate the link between HPWS and perceived quality of care delivery the authors conducted regression analysis with tests of mediation and moderation to analyse survey responses of 201 nurses in a large regional Australian health service and explored HRM and HPWS in detail in three casestudy organisations. To achieve the second aim, the authors surveyed human resource and other senior managers in all Victorian health sector organisations and reviewed policy documents related to health system reform planned for Australia.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nThe findings suggest that there is a relationship between HPWS and the perceived quality of care that is mediated by human resource management (HRM) outcomes, such as psychological empowerment. It is also found that health care organisations in Australia generally do not have the necessary aspects of HPWS in place, creating a policy and practice gap. Although the chief executive officers of health service organisations reported high levels of strategic HRM, the human resource and other managers reported a distinct lack of HPWS from their perspectives. The authors discuss why health care organisations may have difficulty in achieving HPWS.\n\n\nORIGINALITY/VALUE\nLeaders in health care organisations should focus on ensuring human resource management systems, structures and processes that support HPWS.

Fifty male, 6-week-old Wistar strain rats were used in the experiment. A total force of 10g was applied to the rat molars to induce tooth movement. A Ga-Al-As diode laser was used to irradiate the area around the moving tooth and, after 7 days, the amount of tooth movement was measured. To determine the amount of tooth movement, plaster models of the maxillae were made using a silicone impression material before (day 0) and after tooth movement (days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7). The models were scanned using a contact-type three-dimensional (3-D) measurement apparatus. Immunohistochemical staining for MMP-9, cathepsin K, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3 was performed. Intergroup comparisons of the average values were conducted with a Mann-Whitney U-test for tooth movement and the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), MMP-9, cathepsin K, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3-positive cells. In the laser-irradiated group, the amount of tooth movement was significantly greater than that in the non-irradiated group at the end of the experiment (P < 0.05). Cells positively stained with TRAP, MMP-9, cathepsin K, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3 were found to be significantly increased in the irradiated group on days 2-7 compared with those in the non-irradiated group (P < 0.05).

The regulated production of an episome maintenance protein is therefore crucial to their survival. The transcription initiation site of the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 episome maintenance protein, ORF73, was mapped to the viral terminal repeats, more than 10 kb distant from the open reading frame (ORF) itself. A 5' non-coding exon in the terminal repeats was spliced to the right end of the viral unique sequence, and then across ORFs 75a, 75b, 75c and 74 to ORF73. The right-hand portion of a single repeat unit was sufficient for constitutive promoter activity. The unique left end of the viral genome further enhanced ORF73 transcription. This, together with the large size of the predominant ORF73 mRNA, suggested that transcription initiates in distal repeat units and then splices between repeats to generate an extensive 5' untranslated region. A second promoter in the left-hand portion of the proximal terminal repeat unit generated a transcript which overlapped that of ORF73, but failed to splice to the ORF73 coding exon and so transcribed ORF75a. In distal repeat copies, however, transcription from this promoter would enter the next repeat unit to become an ORF73 mRNA. There was a third promoter just upstream of ORF73 itself.

All mRNAs from either promoter have exons in common from the BamHI W viral genomic fragment (the major internal repeat, IR1) which encode the N\u2010terminal portion of one of the nuclear antigens (EBNA 4). In addition to the coding regions for EBNA 4, EBNA mRNAs encode another EBNA (i.e. EBNA 1, 2, 3A, 3B or 3C) downstream. We show that alternative splicing determines whether the translation initiation codon for EBNA 4 is present or absent, thus permitting the generation of mRNAs in which the first translation initiation codon is either that for the EBNA 4 gene or for the other EBNA gene encoded downstream.

To fill this gap, we compared the patterns of pollination and reproductive success in the invasive herb Echium vulgare (Boraginaceae) between monospecific patches (only E. vulgare) and mixed patches (sympatry with native herbs Schizanthus hookeri and Stachys albicaulis) in central Chile. Using sample quadrats of 1\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0m, we quantified the richness, diversity and visitation rate of flower visitors in 15-min observation intervals. We conducted an assay to assess the effect of the patch types (monospecific and mixed) and the isolation of flowers to visitors on both the fruit set and seed/ovule ratio. We showed that native plants favoured the richness of visitors of E. vulgare; however, they did not lead to increases in visitation rate. The reproductive success of E. vulgare did not show differences between contrasted patches; however, the isolation of visitors decreased the fruit set, although seed production was maintained in the absence of pollinators, presumably by an autogamous mechanism. Complementary to our main research focus, we assessed changes in pollination variables and reproductive output in two coflowering native plants that occur with E. vulgare, S. hookeri and S. albicaulis. Despite the fact that our correlational study did not allow us to dissect the effects of mixed patches and relative plant abundances on variables measured for natives, we observed an increase in pollinator richness in mixed patches for the two plants studied. These results suggest a potential facilitation for visitor richness of the exotic plant in coexistence with native plants, although this facilitation does not result in changes in the visit rate or on the reproductive success of any of the studied species. This work underlines the need for additional research on community levels that assess reciprocal effects on pollination between coflowering natives and exotics.", "citedAbstract": "Aims In ecology and conservation biology, the number of species counted in a biodiversity study is a key metric but is usually a biased underestimate of total species richness because many rare species are not detected. Moreover, comparing species richness among sites or samples is a statistical challenge because the observed number of species is sensitive to the number of individuals counted or the area sampled. For individual-based data, we treat a single, empirical sample of species abundances from an investigator-defined species assemblage or community as a reference point for two estimation objectives under two sampling models: estimating the expected number of species (and its unconditional variance) in a random sample of (i) a smaller number of individuals (multinomial model) or a smaller area sampled (Poisson model) and (ii) a larger number of individuals or a larger area sampled. For sample-based incidence (presence\u2013absence) data, under a Bernoulli product model, we treat a single set of species incidence frequencies as the reference point to estimate richness for smaller and larger numbers of sampling units. Methods The first objective is a problem in interpolation that we address with classical rarefaction (multinomial model) and Coleman rarefaction (Poisson model) for individual-based data and with sample-based rarefaction (Bernoulli product model) for incidence frequencies. The second is a problem in extrapolation that we address with sampling-theoretic predictors for the number of species in a larger sample (multinomial model), a larger area (Poisson model) or a larger number of sampling units (Bernoulli product model), based on an estimate of asymptotic species richness. Although published methods exist for many of these objectives, we bring them together here with some new estimators under a unified statistical and notational framework. This novel integration of mathematically distinct approaches allowed us to link interpolated (rarefaction) curves and extrapolated curves to plot a unified species accumulation curve for empirical examples. We provide new, unconditional variance estimators for classical, individual-based rarefaction and for Coleman rarefaction, long missing from the toolkit of biodiversity measurement.

In a quasi-experimental setting, we examine the effects of configuration using a sample of 62 six-person teams in four different one- and twosite configurations.

These comprise increased delta and theta power and the emergence of alpha oscillations over frontal regions. In this study we use a meanfield model of the thalamo-cortical system to reproduce these changes and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The model is able to reproduce the most dominant changes in the EEG and suggests that they are caused by the amplification of resonances within the thalamo-cortical system. Specifically, while observed increases in delta and alpha power are reflections of amplified resonances in the respective frequency bands, increases in theta power are caused indirectly by spectral power leakage from delta and alpha bands. The model suggests that these changes are brought about through increased inhibition within local cortical interneuron circuits. These results are encouraging and motivate more extensive use of neural meanfield models in elucidating the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of pharmacological agents on macroscopic brain dynamics.", "citedAbstract": "The neuronal mechanisms of general anesthesia are still poorly understood. Besides several characteristic features of anesthesia observed in experiments, a prominent effect is the bi-phasic change of power in the observed electroencephalogram (EEG), i.e. the initial increase and subsequent decrease of the EEG-power in several frequency bands while increasing the concentration of the anaesthetic agent. The present work aims to derive analytical conditions for this bi-phasic spectral behavior by the study of a neural population model. This model describes mathematically the effective membrane potential and involves excitatory and inhibitory synapses, excitatory and inhibitory cells, nonlocal spatial interactions and a finite axonal conduction speed. The work derives conditions for synaptic time constants based on experimental results and gives conditions on the resting state stability.

It is well-established that this force generates both shear and longitudinal waves.

In this paper, the modulated radiation force is analytically derived in the case of attenuating media, by expanding on the theory of ultrasound-stimulated-vibro-acoustography (USVA) for lossless media. Furthermore, weak nonlinearities are considered in the formulation, since higher source pressures may prove to be necessary to improve the radiation-force profile - only the fundamental component is, however, studied in this paper. An analysis of the generated radiation force is performed and the effects of various parameters are investigated on its amplitude and spatial distribution. It will be shown that by carefully selecting the confocal geometry of the beams, as well as, the source pressure and center frequency, the spatial profile of the radiation force can be optimized.

Polygraphic recordings were used to calculate the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; mean number of apneas and hypopneas per hour recorded) of all patients preoperatively. Delirium was assessed during the first four postoperative days using the Confusion Assessment Method. Clinical differences between individuals with and without postoperative delirium were determined with univariate analysis. The relationship between postoperative delirium and those covariates that were associated with delirium in univariate analysis was determined by a multivariate logistic regression model.ResultsThe median overall preoperative AHI was 18.3 (interquartile range, 8.7 to 32.8).

This principle can also be used against fast-evolving RNA-viruses. Indeed, targeting protein sites involved in SD\u2009+\u2009SL interactions with a drug would render any mutation of such sites, lethal.ResultsHere, we set up a strategy to detect intragenic pairs of SL and SD at the surface of the protein to predict less escapable drug target sites. For this, we detected SD\u2009+\u2009SL, studying HIV protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) sequence alignments from two groups of VIH+ individuals: treated with drugs (T) or not (NT). Using a series of statistical approaches, we were able to propose bona fide SD\u2009+\u2009SL couples. When focusing on spatially close co-variant SD\u2009+\u2009SL couples at the surface of the protein, we found 5 SD\u2009+\u2009SL groups (2 in the protease and 3 in the reverse transcriptase), which could be good candidates to form pockets to accommodate potential drugs.ConclusionsThus, designing drugs targeting these specific SD\u2009+\u2009SL groups would not allow the virus to mutate any residue involved in such groups without losing an essential function.

The median interquartile ranges (IQR) age was 64.5 (43.9, 78.5) years with the proportion of males at 48.5%.

In this review, we present the recent developments and advances in this area over the past 10\u00a0years, and put to the test some of the new ideas that have emerged during this time, using human and mouse models. A key focus for our discussion are the membrane-bound anion exchangers, belonging to the SLC26 gene family, some of which have been shown to participate in transcellular oxalate absorption and secretion. This has offered the opportunity to not only examine the roles of these specific transporters, revealing their importance to oxalate homeostasis, but to also probe the relative contributions made by the active transcellular and passive paracellular components of oxalate transport across the intestine. We also discuss some of the various physiological stimuli and signaling pathways which have been suggested to participate in the adaptation and regulation of intestinal oxalate transport.

Apical exchangers of the Slc26a family that mediate oxalate absorption have not been established, yet the Slc26a3 [downregulated in adenoma (DRA)] protein is a candidate mediator of oxalate uptake. We evaluated the role of DRA in intestinal oxalate and Cl(-) transport by comparing unidirectional and net ion fluxes across short-circuited segments of small (ileum) and large (cecum and distal colon) intestine from wild-type (WT) and DRA knockout (KO) mice. In WT mice, all segments demonstrated net oxalate and Cl(-) absorption to varying degrees. In KO mice, however, all segments exhibited net anion secretion, which was consistently, and solely, due to a significant reduction in the absorptive unidirectional fluxes. In KO mice, daily urinary oxalate excretion was reduced 66% compared with that in WT mice, while urinary creatinine excretion was unchanged. We conclude that DRA mediates a predominance of the apical uptake of oxalate and Cl(-) absorbed in the small and large intestine of mice under short-circuit conditions.

(b) The region between -4.0 and -5.4 kb from the transcription start site was required for activation of the transgene in nerves.

The family of SOCS proteins is divided into two groups: ancestral and vertebrate-specific SOCS proteins. Vertebrate-specific SOCS proteins have been heavily studied as a result of their strong mutant phenotypes. However, the ancestral clade remains less studied, a potential result of genetic redundancies in mammals. Use of the genetically tractable organism Drosophila melanogaster enables in vivo assessment of signaling components and mechanisms with less concern about the functional redundancy observed in mammals. In this study, we investigated how the SOCS family member Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling at 36E (Socs36E) attenuates Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (Jak/STAT) activation during specification of motile border cells in Drosophila oogenesis. We found that Socs36E genetically interacts with the Cullin2 (Cul2) scaffolding protein. Like Socs36E, Cul2 is required to limit the number of motile cells in egg chambers. We demonstrated that loss of Cul2 in the follicle cells significantly increased nuclear STAT protein levels, which resulted in additional cells acquiring invasive properties. Further, reduction of Cul2 suppressed border cell migration defects that occur in a Stat92E-sensitized genetic background. Our data incorporated Cul2 into a previously described Jak/STAT-directed genetic regulatory network that is required to generate a discrete boundary between cell fates. We also found that Socs36E is able to attenuate STAT activity in the egg chamber when it does not have a functional SOCS box.

Here, we investigate the effect of positive imagery training on rACC activity during the imagination of novel, ambiguous scenarios vs closely matched control training. Seventy-five participants received 4 weeks of positive imagery or control training. Participants underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, during which they completed an Ambiguous Sentences Task, which required them to form mental images in response to cues describing ambiguous social events. rACC activity was positively correlated with the pleasantness ratings of images formed. Positive imagery training increased rACC and bilateral hippocampal activity compared with the control training.

This is consistent with other evidence that this training enhances the vividness of positive imagery, and suggests the training may be acting to increase the intensity and affective quality of imagery simulating the future.", "citedAbstract": "We can imagine looking at ourselves (observer perspective) or through our own eyes (field perspective).

Findings are the first to demonstrate causality of imagery perspective on emotion.

A theoretical analysis was therefore undertaken to explore the phenomenologies of changes in the values of these synaptic parameters.

Defective folding of CFTR lacking phenylalanine 508 (\u0394Phe508) in NBD1 is the most common cause of cystic fibrosis. The Phe508 position seems to be universally important in ABC transporters because deletion of the equivalent residue (Tyr490) in P-gp also inhibits maturation of the protein. The pharmacological chaperone VRT-325 can repair the \u0394Phe508-type folding defects in P-gp or CFTR. VRT-325 may repair the folding defects by promoting dimerization of the two NBDs or by promoting folding of the TMDs. To distinguish between these two mechanisms, we tested the ability of VRT-325 to promote folding of truncation mutants lacking one or both NBDs. Sensitivity to glycosidases was used as an indirect indicator of folding. It was found that VRT-325 could promote maturation of truncation mutants lacking NBD2. Truncation mutants of CFTR or P-gp lacking both NBDs showed deficiencies in core-glycosylation that could be partially reversed by carrying out expression in the presence of VRT-325.

The importance of oxidative stress in the pathobiology of human TBI is largely unknown. The F(2)-isoprostane 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2\u03b1) (8-iso-PGF(2\u03b1)), synthesized in vivo through non-enzymatic free radical catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid, is a widely used biomarker of oxidative stress in multiple disease states, including TBI and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Our hypothesis is that harvesting of biomarkers directly in the injured brain by cerebral microdialysis (MD) is advantageous because of its high spatial and temporal resolution compared to blood or cerebrospinal fluid sampling. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of measuring 8-iso-PGF(2\u03b1) in MD, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (vCSF), and plasma samples collected from patients with severe TBI, and to compare the MD signals with MD-glycerol, implicated as a biomarker of oxidative stress, as well as MD-glutamate, a biomarker of excitotoxicity. Six patients (4 men, 2 women) were included in the study, three of whom had a focal/mixed TBI, and three a diffuse axonal injury (DAI). Following the bedside analysis of routine MD biomarkers (glucose, lactate:pyruvate ratio, glycerol, and glutamate), two 12-h MD samples per day were used to analyze 8-iso-PGF(2\u03b1) from 24\u2009h up to 8 days post-injury.

The mRNA expression of the heavy chain of 4F2 antigen was detected in a more broad area, including all of the regions in which xCT mRNA was detected. These data are compatible with our biochemical evidence that xCT functions in combination with the heavy chain of 4F2 antigen to elicit system xc\u2212 activity.

Here we show that activity-dependent modulation of presynaptic Ca(V)2.1 channels mediated by neuronal Ca(2+) sensor proteins (CaS) induces synaptic plasticity in cultured superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons. A mutation of the IQ-like motif in the C terminus that blocks Ca(2+)/CaS-dependent facilitation of the P/Q-type Ca(2+) current markedly reduces facilitation of synaptic transmission. Deletion of the nearby calmodulin-binding domain, which inhibits CaS-dependent inactivation, substantially reduces depression of synaptic transmission. These results demonstrate that residual Ca(2+) in presynaptic terminals can act through CaS-dependent regulation of Ca(V)2.1 channels to induce short-term synaptic facilitation and rapid synaptic depression. Activity-dependent regulation of presynaptic Ca(V)2.1 channels by CaS proteins may therefore be a primary determinant of short-term synaptic plasticity and information-processing in the nervous system.", "citedAbstract": "NERVE terminals are unique among cellular secretory systems in that they can sustain vesicular release at a high rate. Although little is known about the mechanisms that account for the distinctive features of neurotransmitter release, it can be assumed that neuron-specific proteins are involved. One such protein family, the synapsins, are believed to regulate neurotransmitter release through phosphorylation-dependent interactions with synaptic vesicles and cytoskeletal elements1. Here we show that clusters of vesicles at synaptic release sites are composed of two pools, a distal pool containing synapsin and a proximal pool devoid of synapsin and located adjacent to the presynaptic membrane. Pre-synaptic injection of synapsin antibodies resulted in the loss of the distal pool, without any apparent effect on the proximal pool. Depletion of this distal pool was associated with a marked depression of neurotransmitter release evoked by high-frequency (18-20 Hz) but not by low-frequency (0.2 Hz) stimulation. Thus the availability of the synapsin-associated pool of vesicles seems to be required to sustain release of neurotransmitter in response to high-frequency bursts of impulses.", "citingTitle": "Regulation of Presynaptic CaV2.1 Channels by Ca2+ Sensor Proteins Mediates Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity", "citedTitle": "Distinct pools of synaptic vesicles in neurotransmitter release"}

It is likely that melanolipofuscin accounts for the high levels of autofluorescence, corresponding to linear pigmentation at the level of the RPE.

While research suggests some minorities may exhibit increased cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) to, and slowed recovery from, stress compared to Whites, which may represent a risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular disease, this has not been studied in Arab Americans. This study examined differences between Arab Americans and Whites in cognitive appraisal, and blood pressure and heart rate (HR) reactivity and recovery to laboratory stressors.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe undergraduate sample included 27 Arab Americans (16 female) and 27 gender matched Whites. Eligible participants completed two stressful laboratory tasks (mental arithmetic [MA] and stress-recall [SR]). Cognitive appraisals were assessed for each task, and physiological data were collected during baseline, each laboratory task, and recovery. Ethnicity differences in baseline cardiovascular values and cognitive appraisals were examined with t-tests, while differences in CVR and recovery were tested with ANCOVA, controlling for initial values.\n\n\nRESULTS\nArab Americans showed lower baseline systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure than Whites. Arab Americans also reported greater threat and stress associated with MA, and greater threat for SR. No CVR differences were observed during MA; however during and after SR, Arab Americans evidenced lesser systolic and diastolic blood pressure reactivity and lesser HR recovery compared to Whites.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOverall, Arab Americans showed lesser reactivity than Whites, but also exhibited slower HR recovery.

Limited large-scale population-based surveys and surveillance systems are designed to monitor the health status of minority populations. The Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) 2010 Risk Factor Survey is conducted annually in minority communities in the United States. The survey focuses on four minority populations (blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders [A/PIs], and American Indians).\n\n\nREPORTING PERIOD COVERED\n2001-2002.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM\nTelephone (n = 18 communities) and face-to-face (n = 3 communities) interviews were conducted in 21 communities located in 14 states (Alabama, California, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington). An average of 1,000 minority residents aged >/=18 years in each community was sampled. Interviews were administered in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Khmer, or Mandarin Chinese. The median response rate for household screenings was 74.0% for households that were reached and 72.0% for family members interviewed. The self-reported data from the community were compared with data derived from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for the metropolitan/micropolitan statistical area (MMSA) or the state where the community was located and compared with national estimates from BRFSS.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReported education level and household income were markedly lower in minority communities than the general population living in the comparison MMSA or state. More minorities reported being in fair or poor health, but they did not see a doctor because of the cost. Substantial variations were observed in the prevalence of health-risk factors and selected chronic conditions among minority populations and in communities within the same racial/ethnic minority. The median prevalence of obesity among A/PI men and women was 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively, whereas 39.2% and 37.5% of American Indian men and women were obese, respectively. Cigarette smoking was common in American Indian communities, with a median of 42.2% for men and 36.7% for women. Compared with the national level, fewer minority adults reported eating >/=5 fruits and vegetables daily and met recommendations for moderate or vigorous leisure-time physical activity. American Indian communities had a high prevalence of self-reported cardiovascular disease, hypertension, high blood cholesterol, and diabetes. A high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes was also observed in black communities (32.0% and 10.9%, respectively, for men and 40.4% and 14.3%, respectively, for women). Compared with the general U.S. population, a substantially lower percentage of Hispanics and A/PIs had reported receiving preventive services (e.g., cholesterol screenings; glycosylated hemoglobin tests and foot examinations for patients with diabetes; mammograms and Papanicolaou smear tests; and vaccination for influenza and pneumonia among adults aged >/=65 years).\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nData from the REACH 2010 Risk Factor Survey demonstrate that residents in the minority communities bear greater risks for disease compared with the general population living in the same MMSA or state. Substantial variations in the prevalence of risk factors, chronic conditions, and use of preventive services among different minority populations and in communities within the same racial/ethnic population provide opportunities for public health interventions. These variations also indicate that different racial/ethnic populations and different communities should have different priorities in eliminating health disparities.\n\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS\nThe continuous surveillance of health status in minority communities is necessary so that culturally sensitive prevention strategies can be tailored to these communities and program interventions evaluated.", "citingTitle": "A preliminary investigation of cognitive appraisal and cardiovascular reactivity and recovery in Arab Americans.", "citedTitle": "REACH 2010 Surveillance for Health Status in Minority Communities --- United States, 2001--2002."}

Consumer subsidies can have at least two effects. First, subsidies shift out demand and increase equilibrium quantities, holding production costs fixed. Second, subsidies may encourage firms to innovate to reduce their costs over time. I quantify these impacts by estimating a dynamic structural model of competition among solar panel manufacturers. The model produces two key insights. First, ignoring long-run supply responses can generate biased estimates of the effects of government policy. Without accounting for induced innovation, subsidies increased global solar adoption 49 percent over the period 2010-2015, leading to over $15 billion in external social benefits. Accounting for induced innovation increases the external benefits by at least 22 percent. Second, decentralized government intervention in a global market is inefficient. A subsidy in one country increases long-run solar adoption elsewhere because it increases investment in innovation by international firms. This spillover underscores the need for international coordination to address climate change. \u2217I am grateful to Joe Aldy, Myrto Kalouptsidi, Ariel Pakes, Rob Stavins, and Jim Stock for their invaluable guidance and support.

In this study, we investigated the direct effects of continuous heat stress on the differentiation of cultured mammalian myoblasts. Compared with control cultures grown at 37 degrees C, incubation at 39 degrees C (continuous mild heat stress; CMHS) enhanced myotube diameter, whereas myotubes were poorly formed at 41 degrees C by primary human skeletal muscle culture cells, human skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSMMs), and C2C12 mouse myoblasts. In HSMMs and C2C12 cells exposed to CMHS, mRNA and protein levels of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) type I were increased compared with the control cultures. The mRNA level of MyHC IIx was unaltered in HSMMs and decreased in C2C12 cells, compared with cells that were not exposed to heat stress. These results indicated a fast-to-slow fiber-type shift in myoblasts. We also examined upstream signals that might be responsible for the fast-to-slow shift of fiber types. CMHS enhanced the mRNA and protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha in HSMMS and C2C12 cells but not the activities of MAPKs (ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK) in HSMMs and C2C12 cells. These data suggest that CMHS induces a fast-to-slow fiber-type shift of mammalian myoblasts through PGC-1alpha.", "citedAbstract": "Satellite cell proliferation was assessed in low-frequency-stimulated hypothyroid rat fast-twitch muscle by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and subsequent staining of labeled muscle nuclei, and by staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). BrdU labeling and PCNA staining were highly correlated and increased approximately fourfold at 5 days of stimulation, decayed thereafter, but remained elevated over control in 10- and 20-day stimulated muscles. Myogenin mRNA was approximately 4-fold elevated at 5 days and 1.5-fold at 10 days. Staining for myogenin protein yielded results similar to that for PCNA and BrdU. Furthermore, a detailed examination of the pattern of myogenin staining revealed that the number of myogenin-positive nuclei was elevated in the fast pure IIB fiber population at 5 and 10 days of chronic low-frequency stimulation. By 20 days, myogenin staining was observed in transforming fast fibers that coexpressed embryonic and adult myosin heavy chain isoforms. In the slower fiber populations (i.e., IIA and I), myogenin-positive transforming fibers that coexpressed embryonic myosin heavy chain, appeared already at 5 days. Thus the satellite cell progeny on slower fibers seemed to proliferate less and to fuse earlier to their associated fibers than the satellite cell progeny on fast fibers. We suggest that the increase in muscle nuclei of the fast fibers might be a prerequisite for fast-to-slow fiber type transitions.", "citingTitle": "Continuous mild heat stress induces differentiation of mammalian myoblasts, shifting fiber type from fast to slow.", "citedTitle": "Satellite cell proliferation in low frequency-stimulated fast muscle of hypothyroid rat."}

Recent experimental studies suggest that this neuroanatomical system is also critically involved in motor learning. In the present study, motor learning/transfer capabilities were compared between patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease and a group of normal elderly people. Subjects practiced a bimanual coordination task that required continuous flexion-extension movements in the transverse plane with a 90\u00b0 phase offset between the forearms. During acquisition, augmented visual feedback of the relative motions was provided in real time. The findings revealed improvements in the bimanual coordination pattern across practice in both groups when the augmented concurrent feedback was present. However, when transferred to performance conditions in which the augmented information was withheld, performance deteriorated (relative to the augmented condition) and this effect was more prevalent in the Parkinson patients. More specifically, no improvement in interlimb coordination was observed under nonaugmented feedback conditions across practice. Instead, a drift toward the preferred in-phase and anti-phase coordination patterns was evident. The present findings suggest that Parkinson patients can improve their performance on a new motor task, but they remain strongly dependent on augmented visual information to guide these newly acquired movements. The apparent adoption of a closed-loop control mode is accompanied with decreases in movement speed in order to use the feedback to ensure accuracy. When the augmented feedback is withheld and the movement pattern is to be controlled by means of intrinsic information feedback sources, performance is severely hampered. The findings are hypothesized to indicate that learning/transfer is affected in Parkinson patients who apparently prefer some constancy in the environmental contingencies under which practice takes place. The present findings are consistent with the notion that the basal ganglia form a critical neuroanatomical substrate for motor learning.", "citedAbstract": "Normal voluntary movements are considered to be of two kinds, or to involve two components, (i) a ballistic or \"open-loop\" type, which are preprogrammed and executed without reference to current sensory information and (ii) a corrective or \"closed-loop\" type, whose course or termination are regulated by such information. In a previous paper it was suggested that Parkinsonism disrupted the first kind of movement, but intention tremor did not. In the present paper three experiments designed to test this hypothesis are described. Subjects were tested on an acquisition-tracking task using an oscilloscope display and joystick control, and measurements were made of the duration, velocity and error of their initial movements to acquire the target. Parkinsonian movements were found to be considerably different from normal in that (a) most movements by this group lasted longer than the reaction time for their initiation, as if including some secondary correction in their execution, (b) the rate of movement was not varied for different amplitudes (so keeping the duration fairly constant) as in normal subjects, but rather movements of all amplitudes were made at a constant slow rate, so that duration increased markedly with the larger steps, (c) error increased disproportionately as the velocity of movement increased; in particular any movements completed in one reaction time or less tended to be wildly inaccurate, (d) removing either the target or the response marker from the screen at the beginning of a movement had a significant effect, making it shorter in duration and smaller in amplitude than those usually produced with both markers visible all the time. Parkinsonian subjects showed no improvement in performance with repeated attempts at one movement over a whole sequence, so their deficit appears to be stable even after practice on a known fixed task. These results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that Parkinsonism interferes with the generation of accurate ballistic action which are characteristic of normal skilled movement. Tremor subjects in general resembled normal control subjects in their initial acquistion movements, but their accuracy was less with the larger steps.", "citingTitle": "Interlimb coordination in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease: motor learning deficits and the importance of augmented information feedback", "citedTitle": "Visual \"closed-loop\" and \"open-loop\" characteristics of voluntary movement in patients with Parkinsonism and intention tremor."}

However, there is still controversy about this, and the extent and importance of these inputs are largely unquantified. In particular, there is no information for food webs of small estuaries that dominate wet\u2013dry tropical coasts, where freshwater inflow is intermittent, leading to highly seasonal inputs of nutrients from terrestrial systems. Since the relative importance of the different sources depends on the type and extent of different habitats and on hydrological and topographic conditions, results from other regions/type of systems cannot be extrapolated to these estuaries. Here, \u03b413C is used to determine the importance of mangrove-derived carbon for Penaeus merguiensis (detritivore; shrimp), Ambassis vachellii (planktivore; fish), and Leiognathus equulus (benthivore; fish) from six small wet\u2013dry tropical estuaries that differ in mangrove (C3) cover and in type of terrestrial vegetation adjacent to the estuary. Bayesian mixing models confirmed that mangrove material was important to consumers in all estuaries. There was a gradient in this importance that agreed with the extent of mangrove forests in the estuaries, as C3 sources were the most important contributors to animals from the three estuaries with the greatest (>40\u00a0%) mangrove cover. There was also evidence of incorporation of C3 material for the three estuaries with lower (<30\u00a0%) mangrove cover. Since these latter estuaries had no adjacent terrestrial C3 forests, the detected C3 influence can only be of mangrove origin. This shows that mangroves are important contributors to these food webs, underlining the importance of mangroves in supporting estuarine nursery ground value and fisheries productivity.", "citedAbstract": "Background Stable isotope analysis is increasingly being utilised across broad areas of ecology and biology.

To account for confounding variables, both within-word position and grammatical class were measured, because these factors covary with linguistic stress. Speech samples of 22 preschool children (mean time of 9 months since onset of stuttering) were analyzed. The relative stress of each syllable was rated and syllables were categorized into long and short stressed, unstressed, and intermediately stressed syllables. Results showed that 97.8% of stuttering events occurred on first syllables of words and 76.5% on the first sound of syllables, that means a clear word-initial effect. Stuttering frequency on first syllables of function words was 16.9% and significantly higher than the frequency of stuttered first syllables of content words (11.5%). In function words short stressed syllables and intermediately stressed syllables were stuttered more often than unstressed syllables. The analysis for individual disfluency types revealed that, for function words, stuttering on short stressed syllables was associated with prolongations and syllable repetitions. However, in intermediately stressed syllables stuttering coincided most often with one-syllable word repetitions. This differentiation of the stress effect may suggest different causal mechanisms underlying these disfluency types.\n\n\nEDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES\nThe reader will learn about and be able to: (1) describe how within-word position, grammatical class, and linguistic stress effect stuttering frequency in preschool children who stutter; (2) explain how the occurrence of individual disfluency types depends on linguistic stress; (3) discuss how patterns of adults and preschool children who stutter differ in regard to these aspects.", "citedAbstract": "Thirteen invited papers from a two-day discussion session held in September 1999 are collected in this issue of Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society.

In most cases, this fundamental property is governed by a deeply conserved set of \u2018core PCP\u2019 proteins, which includes the transmembrane proteins Van Gogh-like (Vangl) and Frizzled (Fzd), as well as the cytoplasmic effectors Prickle (Pk) and Dishevelled (Dvl). Asymmetric localization of these proteins is thought to be central to their function, and understanding the dynamics of these proteins is an important challenge in developmental biology. Among the processes that are organized by the core PCP proteins is the directional beating of cilia, such as those in the vertebrate node, airway and brain. Here, we exploit the live imaging capabilities of Xenopus to chart the progressive asymmetric localization of fluorescent reporters of Dvl1, Pk2 and Vangl1 in a planar polarized ciliated epithelium. Using this system, we also characterize the influence of Pk2 on the asymmetric dynamics of Vangl1 at the cell cortex, and we define regions of Pk2 that control its own localization and those impacting Vangl1. Finally, our data reveal a striking uncoupling of Vangl1 and Dvl1 asymmetry. This study advances our understanding of conserved PCP protein functions and also establishes a rapid, tractable platform to facilitate future in vivo studies of vertebrate PCP protein dynamics.

Performance tests allow for a controlled simulation of sports and exercise performance for research or applied science purposes. There are three factors that contribute to a good performance test: (i) validity; (ii) reliability; and (iii) sensitivity. A valid protocol is one that resembles the performance that is being simulated as closely as possible. When investigating race-type events, the two most common protocols are time to exhaustion and time trials. Time trials have greater validity than time to exhaustion because they provide a good physiological simulation of actual performance and correlate with actual performance. Sports such as soccer are more difficult to simulate. While shuttle-running protocols such as the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test may simulate physiology of soccer using time to exhaustion or distance covered, it is not a valid measure of soccer performance. There is a need to include measures of skill in such protocols. Reliability is the variation of a protocol. Research has shown that time-to-exhaustion protocols have a coefficient of variation (CV) of >10%, whereas time trials are more reliable as they have been shown to have a CV of <5%. A sensitive protocol is one that is able to detect small, but important, changes in performance. The difference between finishing first and second in a sporting event is <1%. Therefore, it is important to be able to detect small changes with performance protocols. A quantitative value of sensitivity may be accomplished through the signal : noise ratio, where the signal is the percentage improvement in performance and the noise is the CV.", "citingTitle": "Tests for the Assessment of Sport-Specific Performance in Olympic Combat Sports: A Systematic Review With Practical Recommendations", "citedTitle": "Validity, Reliability and Sensitivity of Measures of Sporting Performance"}

Ligand-activated FLS2 traffics into late endosomal compartments, and this process requires the function of components distinct from nonactivated FLS2 that recycles between early endosomes and the plasma membrane. The activity of surface receptors is location specific, dependent upon the dynamic membrane trafficking network and receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME). Therefore, the spatio-temporal dynamics of RME are critical to receptor function. The plasma membrane receptor FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2) confers immunity against bacterial infection through perception of flagellin (flg22). Following elicitation, FLS2 is internalized into vesicles. To resolve FLS2 trafficking, we exploited quantitative confocal imaging for colocalization studies and chemical interference. FLS2 localizes to bona fide endosomes via two distinct endocytic trafficking routes depending on its activation status. FLS2 receptors constitutively recycle in a Brefeldin A (BFA)\u2013sensitive manner, while flg22-activated receptors traffic via ARA7/Rab F2b\u2013 and ARA6/Rab F1\u2013positive endosomes insensitive to BFA. FLS2 endocytosis required a functional Rab5 GTPase pathway as revealed by dominant-negative ARA7/Rab F2b. Flg22-induced FLS2 endosomal numbers were increased by Concanamycin A treatment but reduced by Wortmannin, indicating that activated FLS2 receptors are targeted to late endosomes.

Using a synthetic approach we construct a conceptual model that, instead of specifying mechanistic requirements to generate criticality, exploits the maintenance of an organizational structure capable of reproducing critical behavior. Our approach exploits the well-known principle of universality, which classifies critical phenomena inside a few universality classes of systems independently of their specific mechanisms or topologies. In particular, we implement an artificial embodied agent controlled by a neural network maintaining a correlation structure randomly sampled from a lattice Ising model at a critical point. We evaluate the agent in two classical reinforcement learning scenarios: the Mountain Car benchmark and the Acrobot double pendulum, finding that in both cases the neural controller reaches a point of criticality, which coincides with a transition point between two regimes of the agent's behaviour, maximizing the mutual information between neurons and sensorimotor patterns. Finally, we discuss the possible applications of this synthetic approach to the comprehension of deeper principles connected to the pervasive presence of criticality in biological and cognitive systems.", "citedAbstract": "There are many different kinds of model and scientists do all kind of things with them. This diversity of model type and model use is a good thing for science. Indeed, it is crucial especially for the biological and cognitive sciences, which have to solve many different problems at many different scales, ranging from the most concrete of the structural details of a DNA molecule to the most abstract and generic principles of self-organization in networks. Getting a grip (or more likely many separate grips) on this range of topics calls for a teeming forest of techniques, including many different modeling techniques. Barbara Webb\u2019s target article strikes us as a proposal for clear-cutting the forest. We think clear-cutting here would be as good for science as it is for non-metaphorical forests. Our argument for this is primarily a recitation of a few of the ways that diversity has been useful. Recently, looking at the actual practice of artificial life modelers, one of us distinguished four uses of simulation models classified in terms of the position the models take up between theory and data (see Figure 1). The classification is not exhaustive, and the barriers between kinds are not absolute. Rather, the purpose of the taxonomy is to open up the view for an epistemic ecology of modeling practices. First, and closest to the empirical domain, there are mechanistic models, in which there is an almost one-to-one correspondence between variables in the model and observables in the target system and its environment. Webb\u2019s cricket robot is a paradigmatic example of this type. Second, there are functional models, which aim for a behavioral or functional rather than a variable-to-variable correspondence between the model system and its target. Many models in cognitive psychology are of this type, as are many in biology when the underlying mechanisms are not accessible to modeling correspondence (see Vickerstaff & Di Paolo, 2005, for a good example of this). Third, there are generic models, which cover a wide spectrum of phenomena in search for generic principles of complex systems. Cellular automata, random Boolean networks, and the like belong to this class. Finally, there are conceptual models, which do not target any particular natural system nor a wide spectrum of them. Instead conceptual models are built from theories, for which they embody assumptions, illustrate concepts, simulate theoretical principles, and so forth. Beer\u2019s model and many other animats are of this type (for more details see Barandiaran, 2008, chap. 2; Barandiaran & Moreno, 2006). Modeling is a relational activity, it involves the template or construct (usually referred as the model) and also an interpretative framework (made of assumptions, generalizations, definitions, etc.) that puts the model in connection with other models, theories or objects. It is this interpretative framework and the modelers\u2019 intentions that situate a given model into one of the categories of models. But only mechanistic models are used as Webb suggests all models should be: \u201cthe cricket robot is a mixed physical and computational implementation of a particular hypothesis about an observed phenomenon of sensorimotor behavior in", "citingTitle": "Criticality as it could be: Organizational invariance as self-organized criticality in embodied agents", "citedTitle": "Animats in the Modeling Ecosystem"}

However, these results may be confounded by the task domain, which is typically verbal. Indeed, some studies show that right PFC activation is seen with spatial tasks. This study used fMRI to examine the effects of process and domain on the brain regions recruited during a novel pattern discovery task. Twenty healthy young adult participants were asked to discover the rule underlying the presentation of a series of letters in varied spatial locations. The rules were either verbal (pertaining to a single semantic category) or spatial (geometric figures). Bilateral ventrolateral PFC activations were seen for the spatial domain, while the verbal domain showed only left ventrolateral PFC.

By contrast, rule following was associated with activation in temporal, motor, and medial/anterior prefrontal cortex. Moreover, frontopolar cortex (FPC) was active throughout the rule acquisition and rule following phases before a rule became familiar.

The nuclear receptor ESRRB is expressed in mESCs and plays a significant role in their self-renewal, but its expression has not been observed in most naive-like human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In this study, we modified several methods for converting hiPSCs into a naive state through the transgenic expression of several reprogramming factors. The resulting cells express the components of the core transcriptional network of mESCs, including ESRRB, at high levels, which suggests the existence of naive-state hiPSCs that are similar to mESCs. We also demonstrate that these cells differentiate more readily into neural cells than do conventional hiPSCs. These features may be beneficial for their use in disease modeling and regenerative medicine.", "citedAbstract": "Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) closely resemble mouse epiblast stem cells exhibiting primed pluripotency unlike mouse ESCs (mESCs), which acquire a na\u00efve pluripotent state.

This required either ectopic expression of na\u00efve genes such as NANOG and KLF2 or inclusion of multiple pluripotency\u2010associated factors. We report here a novel combination of small molecules and growth factors in culture medium (2i/LIF/basic fibroblast growth factor\u2009+\u2009Ascorbic Acid\u2009+\u2009Forskolin) facilitating rapid induction of transgene\u2010free na\u00efve pluripotency in hESCs, as well as in mESCs, which has not been shown earlier.

Potential surrogates were: distance from artificial watering-point; soil hardness; habitat complexity; and individual complexity components. Generalised additive models (GAMs) were used to relate abundance and richness of selected invertebrates with environmental factors and cluster analysis was used to examine similarity in species composition. The most frequently selected factor was soil hardness, but taxa varied as to whether biodiversity was higher in soft or hard soils. Where distance from watering-point was an important predictor, there were generally higher abundances and richness closer to watering-points than further away. Abundance and species richness could be partially explained using individual complexity components, but relationships were weak and there were no consistent trends among taxa. Therefore, although habitat complexity has been correlated with species richness under some circumstances, our results cast doubt on the generality of this relationship. There are also dangers in assuming that all taxa respond in a manner similar to indicator taxa, as we observed that different taxa had higher richness at opposite extremes of some environmental gradients.

Childhood adversity has been shown to modify this response, but evidence is inconsistent. Effects may differ depending on the timing of exposure, or due to the interplay between pre/postnatal adversity and later adversities. The present study examined the influence of adversity during different timeframes (pre/postnatal, ages 0-5, 6-11, 12-13, 14-15 years), and the interaction between pre/postnatal and later adversity on adolescents' cortisol stress response.\n\n\nMETHOD\nFour salivary cortisol samples were collected before and after a social stress test in 471 16-year-old adolescents from the longitudinal study TRAILS. Data on pre/postnatal exposure to adversities were obtained from Preventive Child Healthcare records and parental reports, subsequent adversities from parental and self-reports.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPre/postnatal adversity was associated with increased cortisol reactivity.

However, those separated from both parents had higher average salivary cortisol and plasma ACTH concentrations across all time points compared to the non-separated group. They also had higher salivary cortisol reactivity to the TSST. Separated women had higher baselines in plasma cortisol and ACTH, whereas men had higher reactivity in response to stress during the TSST.

However, model comparison to date focuses only on specific subclasses, e.g. compartment models or signal models, and little or no information is available in the literature on how performance varies among the different types of models. To address this deficiency, we organized the \u2018White Matter Modeling Challenge\u2019 during the International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2015 conference. This competition aimed to compare a range of different kinds of models in their ability to explain a large range of measurable in vivo DW human brain data. Specifically, we assessed the ability of models to predict the DW signal accurately for new diffusion gradients and b values. We did not evaluate the accuracy of estimated model parameters, as a ground truth is hard to obtain. We used the Connectome scanner at the Massachusetts General Hospital, using gradient strengths of up to 300\u2009mT/m and a broad set of diffusion times. We focused on assessing the DW signal prediction in two regions: the genu in the corpus callosum, where the fibres are relatively straight and parallel, and the fornix, where the configuration of fibres is more complex. The challenge participants had access to three\u2010quarters of the dataset and their models were ranked on their ability to predict the remaining unseen quarter of the data. The challenge provided a unique opportunity for a quantitative comparison of diverse methods from multiple groups worldwide. The comparison of the challenge entries reveals interesting trends that could potentially influence the next generation of diffusion\u2010based quantitative MRI techniques. The first is that signal models do not necessarily outperform tissue models; in fact, of those tested, tissue models rank highest on average. The second is that assuming a non\u2010Gaussian (rather than purely Gaussian) noise model provides little improvement in prediction of unseen data, although it is possible that this may still have a beneficial effect on estimated parameter values. The third is that preprocessing the training data, here by omitting signal outliers, and using signal\u2010predicting strategies, such as bootstrapping or cross\u2010validation, could benefit the model fitting. The analysis in this study provides a benchmark for other models and the data remain available to build up a more complete comparison in the future.", "citedAbstract": "This paper compares a range of compartment models for diffusion MRI data on in vivo human acquisitions from a standard 60mT/m system (Philips 3T Achieva) and a unique 300mT/m system (Siemens Connectom). The key aim is to determine whether both systems support broadly the same models or whether the Connectom higher gradient system supports significantly more complex models. A single volunteer underwent 8h of acquisition on each system to provide uniquely wide and dense sampling of the available space of pulsed-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) measurements. We select a set of promising models from the wide set of possible three-compartment models for in vivo white matter (WM) that previous work and preliminary experiments suggest as strong candidates, but extend them to fit for compartmental T2 and diffusivity. We focus on the corpus callosum where the WM fibre architecture is simplest and compare their ability to explain the measured data, using Akaike's information criterion (AIC), and to predict unseen data, using cross-validation. We also compare the stability of parameter estimates in the presence of i) noise, using bootstrapping, and ii) spatial variation, using visual assessment and comparison with anatomical knowledge. Broadly similar models emerge from the AIC and cross-validation experiments in both data sets. Specifically, a three-compartment model consisting of either a Bingham distribution of sticks or a Cylinder for the intracellular compartment, an anisotropic diffusion tensor (DT) model for the extracellular compartment, as well as an isotropic CSF compartment, performs consistently well. However, various other models also perform well and no single model emerges as clear winner. The WM data (with virtually no CSF contamination) do not support compartmental T2 but partially support compartmental diffusivity. Evaluation of parameter stability favours simpler models than those identified by AIC or cross-validation. They suggest that the level of complexity in models underpinning currently popular microstructure imaging techniques such as NODDI, CHARMED, or ActiveAx, where the number of free parameters is about 4 or 5 rather than 10 or 11, may reflect the level of complexity achievable for a useful technique on current systems, although the 300mT/m data may support more complex models.", "citingTitle": "Diffusion MRI microstructure models with in vivo human brain Connectome data: results from a multi\u2010group comparison", "citedTitle": "White matter compartment models for in vivo diffusion MRI at 300mT/m"}

Both external and internal Ca2+ stores are likely important during male gametophyte communication with the sporophytic and gametophytic cells within the pistil. Given that calreticulin (CRT), a Ca2+-buffering protein, is able to bind Ca2+ reversibly, it can serve as a mobile store of easily releasable Ca2+ (so called an exchangeable Ca2+) in eukaryotic cells. CRT has typical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting and retention signals and resides primarily in the ER. However, localization of this protein outside the ER has also been revealed in both animal and plant cells, including Golgi/dictyosomes, nucleus, plasma membrane/cell surface, plasmodesmata, and even extracellular matrix. These findings indicate that CRT may function in a variety of different cell compartments and specialized structures. We have recently shown that CRT is highly expressed and accumulated in the ER of plant cells involved in pollen-pistil interactions in Petunia, and we proposed an essential role for CRT in intracellular Ca2+ storage and mobilization during the key reproductive events. Here, we demonstrate that both CRT and exchangeable Ca2+ are localized in the intra/extracellular peripheries of highly specialized plant cells, such as the pistil transmitting tract cells, pollen tubes, nucellus cells surrounding the embryo sac, and synergids.

Shifting of distribution range may affect global marine fisheries and have large socio-economic implications. However, globalscale evaluation of the impact of climate change on marine species is lacking. In this paper, we develop a dynamic bioclimate envelope model to predict the effect of climate change on the distributions of marine species with emphasis on commercially exploited fishes and invertebrates. First, the model infers, for various species, bioclimate envelopes based on their current distribution. Bioclimate envelopes are defined by sea water temperature, bathymetry, habitats and distance from sea ice. Secondly, the model predicts the shifting of the bioclimate envelopes induced by changes in climate variables. Simultaneously, following the shifting of the bioclimate envelopes, the model simulates movement of relative abundance through changes in population growth, mortality, larval dispersal and adult movement. We test the model with several commercially exploited fish species with widely different biogeography. The model provides reasonable and robust predictions of future distribution ranges of the four species under different scenarios of sea water warming. Moreover, the predictions are robust to major model assumptions and parameter uncertainty. Using realistic climate change predictions from the NOAA/GFDL Coupled Model, this model will be used to evaluate impacts of climate change on global marine fisheries. INTRODUCTION There is ample evidence from empirical observations and climate models indicating that mean global temperatures have been increasing over the last 100 years (IPCC 2007). Global temperature has increased by over 0.6 oC since 1900 and it may continue to increase at a rate of around 0.2 oC per decade (IPCC 2007). Biological responses to this change have been observed in both terrestrial and marine biomes (Murawski 1993; Hughes 2000; McCarty 2001; Parmesan & Yohe 2003; Perry et al. 2005; Hobday et al. 2006). The responses include changes in physiology (e.g. productivity), geographic range and phenology at population, species, community and ecosystem levels (Hughes 2000; McCarty 2001). For instance, nearly two-thirds of marine fishes in the North Sea shifted in mean latitude or depth or both over 25 years as sea temperature increased (Perry et al. 2005). During the last century, annual growth rates for the juveniles of eight long-lived fish species in the southwest Pacific increased in shallow waters and decreased in deep waters where ocean warming and cooling occurred, respectively (Thresher et al 2007). This agrees with the quantitative model of fish physiology, which predicts increasing growth performance and fecundity in higher latitude and the converse in lower latitude as sea 1 Cited as: Cheung, W.W.L., Lam, V.W.Y., Pauly, D. 2008.

This cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. The framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules.

This pattern has led to suggestions that reinforcement may be the source of the observed selection. Reproductive character displacement, or increased divergence of reproductive characters in areas where closely related species overlap, is often a consequence of reinforcement and has been shown to be present in one Indo-Pacific species of the genus Echinometra. In the Atlantic species of the same genus, positive selection has been shown to act on bindin of Echinometra lucunter. To examine whether the source of this selection is reinforcement, we determined variation on the first exon of bindin in E. lucunter in the Caribbean, where it is sympatric with Echinometra viridis, and in the rest of the Atlantic, where E. viridis is absent. There was no differentiation between bindin sequences from the two geographic regions; similar levels of positive selection were found to be acting in both areas. The similarities were not due to gene flow; mitochondrial DNA from the two regions indicates that E. lucunter populations most likely originated in the Atlantic and have not exchanged genes with Caribbean populations for approximately 200,000 years. The lack of evidence of stronger selection on bindin of E. lucunter in areas of sympatry with its sister species suggests that the source of selection is not reinforcement.

Previous analyses have shown that diversifying selection on bindin amino acid sequence is found when gametically incompatible species are compared, but not when species are compatible. The present study analyzes bindin polymorphism and divergence in the three closely related species of Echinometra in Central America: E. lucunter and E. viridis from the Caribbean, and E. vanbrunti from the eastern Pacific. The eggs of E. lucunter have evolved a strong block to fertilization by sperm of its neotropical congeners, whereas those of the other two species have not. As in the Indo-West Pacific (IWP) Echinometra, the neotropical species show high intraspecific bindin polymorphism in the same gene regions as in the IWP species. Maximum likelihood analysis shows that many of the polymorphic codon sites are under mild positive selection. Of the fixed amino acid replacements, most have accumulated along the bindin lineage of E. lucunter. We analyzed the data with maximum likelihood models of variation in positive selection across lineages and codon sites, and with models that consider sites and lineages simultaneously. Our results show that positive selection is concentrated along the E. lucunter bindin lineage, and that codon sites with amino acid replacements fixed in this species show by far the highest signal of positive selection. Lineage-specific positive selection paralleling egg incompatibility provides support that adaptive evolution of sperm proteins acts to maintain recognition of bindin by changing egg receptors. Because both egg incompatibility and bindin divergence are greater between allopatric species than between sympatric species, the hypothesis of selection against hybridization (reinforcement) cannot explain why adaptive evolution has been confined to a single lineage in the American Echinometra. Instead, processes acting to varying degrees within species (e.g., sperm competition, sexual selection, and sexual conflict) are more promising explanations for lineage-specific positive selection on bindin.", "citingTitle": "Lack of character displacement in the male recognition molecule, bindin, in Altantic sea urchins of the genus Echinometra.", "citedTitle": "Adaptive evolution of sperm bindin tracks egg incompatibility in neotropical sea urchins of the genus Echinometra."}

This effect is due to the S(+)-enantiomer (dexketoprofen), while the R(\u2212)-enantiomer is devoid of such activity.The pharmacokinetic profile of ketoprofen and its enantiomers was assessed in several animal species and in human volunteers. In humans, the relative bioavailability of oral dexketoprofen trometamol (12.5 and 25mg, respectively) is similar to that of oral racemic ketoprofen (25 and 50mg, respectively), as measured in all cases by the area under the concentration-time curve values for S(+)-ketoprofen. Dexketoprofen trometamol, given as a tablet, is rapidly absorbed, with a time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of between 0.25 and 0.75 hours, whereas the tmax for the S-enantiomer after the racemic drug, administered as tablets or capsules prepared with the free acid, is between 0.5 and 3 hours. Peak plasma concentrations of 1.4 and 3.1 mg/L are reached after administration of dexketoprofen trometamol 12.5 and 25mg, respectively.From 70 to 80% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine during the first 12 hours, mainly as the acyl-glucuronoconjugated parent drug. No R(\u2212)-ketoprofen is found in the urine after administration of dexketoprofen [S(+)-ketoprofen], confirming the absence of bioinversion of the S(+)-enantiomer in humans.In animal studies, the anti-inflammatory potency of dexketoprofen was always equivalent to that demonstrated by twice the dose of ketoprofen. Similarly, animal studies showed a high analgesic potency for dexketoprofen trometamol. The R(\u2212)-enantiomer demonstrated a much lower potency, its analgesic action being apparent only in conditions where the metabolic bioinversion to the S(+)-enantiomer was significant.The gastric ulcerogenic effects of dexketoprofen at various oral doses (1.5 to 6 mg/kg) in the rat do not differ from those of the corresponding double doses (3 to 12 mg/kg) of racemic ketoprofen. Repeated (5-day) oral administration of dexketoprofen as the trometamol salt causes less gastric ulceration than was observed after the acid form of both dexketoprofen and the racemate. In addition, single dose dexketoprofen as the free acid at 10 or 20 mg/kg does not show a significant intestinal ulcerogenic effect in rats, while racemic ketoprofen 20 or 40 mg/kg is clearly ulcerogenic to the small intestine.The analgesic efficacy of oral dexketoprofen trometamol 10 and 20mg is superior to that of placebo and similar to that of ibuprofen 400mg in patients with moderate to severe pain after third molar extraction. The time to onset of pain relief appeared to be shorter in patients treated with dexketoprofen trometamol than in those treated with ibuprofen 400mg. Dexketoprofen trometamol was well tolerated, with a reported incidence of adverse events similar to that of placebo.", "citingTitle": "Synergism between dexketoprofen and meloxicam in an orofacial formalin test was not modified by opioid antagonists.", "citedTitle": "Preclinical and Clinical Development of Dexketoprofen"}

To begin characterization of the compensating mechanisms, we analyzed total transamidating activity and expression patterns of all catalytically active TGs in seven different tissues/organs from wild-type and TG2 knockout mice. Inhibitory analysis with TG2-specific inhibitor KCC-009 suggests that relative contribution of TG2 in total transamidating activity differs in various tissues. Accordingly, our data indicate tissue-specific mechanisms of compensation for the loss of TG2, including transcriptional compensation in heart and liver versus functional compensation in aorta, kidney and skeletal/cartiagenous tissues.

We now have isolated a full-length cDNA for this molecule, and confirmed that it is avian factor XIIIA. Northern and enzymatic analyses confirm that the molecule is upregulated in hypertrophic chondrocytes (as much as eightfold). The enzymatic analyses also show that appreciable transglutaminase activity in the hypertrophic zone becomes externalized into the extracellular matrix. This externalization most likely is effected by cell death and subsequent lysis\u2014effected by the transglutaminase itself. When hypertrophic chondrocytes are transfected with a cDNA construct encoding the zymogen of factor XIIIA, the cells convert the translated protein to a lower molecular weight form, and they initiate cell death, become permeable to macromolecules and eventually undergo lysis. Non-hypertrophic cells transfected with the same construct do not show these degenerative changes. These results suggest that hypertrophic chondrocytes have a novel, tissue-specific cascade of mechanisms that upregulate the synthesis of plasma transglutaminase and activate its zymogen. This produces autocatalytic cell death, externalization of the enzyme, and presumably cross-linking of components within the hypertrophic matrix. These changes may in turn regulate the removal and/or calcification of this hypertrophic matrix, which are its ultimate fates.", "citingTitle": "Tissue-specific responses to loss of transglutaminase 2", "citedTitle": "Plasma Transglutaminase in Hypertrophic Chondrocytes: Expression and Cell-specific Intracellular Activation Produce Cell Death and Externalization"}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a historical cohort, 725 children born in 2013 were selected using multi-stage random sampling from health centers licensed by Isfahan Medical University and followed up to 1-year and their related specifications were extracted from ages and stages questionnaire and their families\u2019 files.

RESULTS: The minimum and maximum scores of development were observed in the personal-social domain (52.38 \u00b1 9.1) and fine motor (56.06 \u00b1 5.9), respectively. The results showed that the child spacing has direct relation with development in fine motor domain (r = 0.2, P < 0.001), personal-social development (r = 0.197, P = 0.001), and problem solving domain (r = 0.18, P = 0.002).

Subjects were a representative sample of 4621 US-born singleton children, aged 2-47 months, examined in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-94).

However, we know little about how gene regulation evolves in birds, and how divergent genomes interact in their hybrids. Because of the unique features of birds \u2013 female heterogamety, a highly conserved karyotype, and the slow evolution of reproductive incompatibilities \u2013 an understanding of regulatory evolution in birds is critical to a comprehensive understanding of regulatory evolution and its implications for speciation. Using a novel complement of analyses of replicated RNA-seq libraries, we demonstrate abundant divergence in brain gene expression between zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) subspecies. By comparing parental populations and their F1 hybrids, we also show that gene misexpression is relatively rare among brain-expressed transcripts in male birds. If this pattern is consistent across tissues and sexes, it may partially explain the slow buildup of postzygotic reproductive isolation observed in birds relative to other taxa. Although we expected that the action of genetic drift on the island-dwelling zebra finch subspecies would be manifested in a higher rate of trans regulatory divergence, we found that most divergence was in cis regulation, following a pattern commonly observed in other taxa. Thus, our study highlights both unique and shared features of avian regulatory evolution.", "citedAbstract": "Genetic changes affecting gene expression contribute to phenotypic divergence; thus, understanding how regulatory networks controlling gene expression change over time is critical for understanding evolution. Prior studies of expression differences within and between species have identified properties of regulatory divergence, but technical and biological differences among these studies make it difficult to assess the generality of these properties or to understand how regulatory changes accumulate with divergence time. Here, we address these issues by comparing gene expression among strains and species of Drosophila with a range of divergence times and use F1 hybrids to examine inheritance patterns and disentangle cis- and trans-regulatory changes. We find that the fixation of compensatory changes has caused the regulation of gene expression to diverge more rapidly than gene expression itself. Specifically, we observed that the proportion of genes with evidence of cis-regulatory divergence has increased more rapidly with divergence time than the proportion of genes with evidence of expression differences. Surprisingly, the amount of expression divergence explained by cis-regulatory changes did not increase steadily with divergence time, as was previously proposed. Rather, one species (Drosophila sechellia) showed an excess of cis-regulatory divergence that we argue most likely resulted from positive selection in this lineage. Taken together, this work reveals not only the rate at which gene expression evolves, but also the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for this evolution.", "citingTitle": "Gene Regulatory Evolution During Speciation in a Songbird", "citedTitle": "Tempo and mode of regulatory evolution in Drosophila."}

Here we analyzed positionally conserved determinants in VP1-2 homologues from each of the alpha, beta, and gamma classes of human herpesviruses. The overall architectures of the VP1-2s were similar, with a conserved N-terminal ubiquitin-specific protease domain separated from an internal region by a linker that was quite poorly conserved in length and sequence. Within this linker region all herpesviruses contained a conserved, highly basic motif which nevertheless exhibited distinct class-specific features. The motif in HSV functioned as a monopartite NLS, while in varicella-zoster virus (VZV) activity required an adjacent basic section defining the motif as a bipartite NLS. Neither the beta- nor gammaherpesvirus VP1-2 motifs were identified by prediction algorithms, but they nevertheless functioned as efficient NLS motifs both in heterologous transfer assays and in HSV VP1-2. Furthermore, though with different efficiencies and with the exception of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), these chimeric variants rescued the replication defect of an HSV mutant lacking its NLS motif. We demonstrate that the lysine at position 428 of HSV is critical for replication, with a single alanine substitution being sufficient to abrogate NLS function and virus growth. We conclude that the basic motifs of each of the VP1-2 proteins are likely to confer a similar function in capsid entry in the homologous setting and that while there is flexibility in the exact type of motif employed, specific individual residues are critical for function. IMPORTANCE To successfully infect cells, all herpesviruses, along with many other viruses, e.g., HIV, hepatitis B virus, and influenza virus, must navigate through the cytoplasmic environment and dock with nuclear pores for transport of their genomes into the nucleus. However, we still have a limited understanding of the detailed mechanisms involved. Insight into these events is needed and could offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention. This work investigated the role of a specific determinant in the structural protein VP1-2 in herpesvirus entry. We examined this determinant in representative VP1-2s from all herpesvirus subfamilies, demonstrated NLS function, dissected key residues, and showed functional relevance in rescuing replication of the mutant blocked in capsid navigation to the pore. The results are important and strongly support our conclusions of the generality that these motifs are crucial for entry of all herpesviruses. They also facilitate future analysis on selective host interactions and possible routes to disrupt function.", "citedAbstract": "ABSTRACT The herpes simplex virus (HSV) tegument protein VP1-2 is essential for virus entry and assembly. VP1-2 also contains a highly conserved ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) domain within its N-terminal region. Despite conservation of the USP and the demonstration that it can act on artificial substrates such as polyubiquitin chains, identification of the relevance of the USP in vivo to levels or function of any substrate remains limited. Here we show that HSV VP1-2 USP can act on itself and is important for stability. VP1-2 N-terminal variants encompassing the core USP domain itself were not affected by mutation of the catalytic cysteine residue (C65). However, extending the N-terminal region resulted in protein species requiring USP activity for accumulation. In this context, C65A mutation resulted in a drastic reduction in protein levels which could be stabilized by proteosomal inhibition or by the presence of normal C65. The functional USP domain could increase abundance of unstable variants, indicating action at least in part, in trans. Interestingly, full-length variants containing the inactive USP, although unstable when expressed in isolation, were stabilized by virus infection. The catalytically inactive VP1-2 retained complementation activity of a VP1-2-negative virus. Furthermore, a recombinant virus expressing a C65A mutant VP1-2 exhibited little difference in single-step growth curves and the kinetics and abundance of VP1-2 or a number of test proteins.

We observe that CyaY participates in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly as an iron-dependent inhibitor of cluster formation, through binding to the desulfurase IscS.

The functional consequences of these accumulated molecules are unknown. HS critically influences tissue morphogenesis by binding to and modulating the activity of several cytokines (eg, fibroblast growth factors [FGFs]) involved in developmental patterning. We recently isolated a multipotent progenitor cell from postnatal human bone marrow, which differentiates into cells of all 3 embryonic lineages. The availability of multipotent progenitor cells from healthy volunteers and patients with MPS-I (Hurler syndrome) provides a unique opportunity to directly examine the functional effects of abnormal HS on cytokine-mediated stem-cell proliferation and survival. We demonstrate here that abnormally sulfated HS in Hurler multipotent progenitor cells perturb critical FGF-2-FGFR1-HS interactions, resulting in defective FGF-2-induced proliferation and survival of Hurler multipotent progenitor cells. Both the mitogenic and survival-promoting activities of FGF-2 were restored by substitution of Hurler HS by normal HS. This perturbation of critical HS-cytokine receptor interactions may represent a mechanism by which accumulated HS contributes to the developmental pathophysiology of Hurler syndrome. Similar mechanisms may operate in the pathogenesis of other diseases where structurally abnormal GAGs accumulate.", "citedAbstract": "Stem cell localization, conservation, and differentiation is believed to occur in niches in the marrow stromal microenvironment. Our recent observation that long-term in vitro human hematopoiesis requires a stromal heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) led us to hypothesize that such HSPG may orchestrate the formation of the stem cell niche. We compared the structure and function of HS from M2-10B4, a hematopoiesis-supportive cell line, with HS from a nonsupportive cell line, FHS-173-We. Long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) maintenance was enhanced by PG from supportive cells but not by PG from nonsupportive cells (P <.005). The supportive HS were significantly larger and more highly sulfated than the nonsupportive HS. Specifically, supportive HS contained higher 6-O-sulfation on the glucosamine residues. In agreement with these observations, purified 6-O-sulfated heparin and highly 6-O-sulfated bovine kidney HS similarly maintained LTC-IC. In contrast, completely desulfated heparin, N-sulfated heparin, and unmodified heparin did not support LTC-IC maintenance. Moreover, the supportive HS promoted LTC-IC maintenance but not differentiation of CD34(+)/HLA-DR- cells into colony-forming cells (CFCs) and mature blood cells. The supportive HS but not the nonsupportive HS bound both cytokines and matrix components critical for hematopoiesis, including interleukin-3 (IL-3), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1), and thrombospondin (TSP). Significantly more CD34(+) cells adhered directly to immobilized O-sulfated heparin than to N-sulfated or desulfated heparin. Thus, hematopoiesis-supportive stromal HSPG possessing large, highly 6-O-sulfated HS mediate the juxtaposition of hematopoietic progenitors with stromal cells, specific growth-promoting (IL-3) and growth-inhibitory (MIP-1 and platelet factor 4 [PF4]) cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as TSP. We conclude that the structural specificity of stromal HSPG that determines the selective colocalization of cytokines and ECM components leads to the formation of discrete niches, thereby orchestrating the controlled growth and differentiation of stem cells. These findings may have important implications for ex vivo expansion of and gene transfer into primitive hematopoietic progenitors.", "citingTitle": "Functional abnormalities of heparan sulfate in mucopolysaccharidosis-I are associated with defective biologic activity of FGF-2 on human multipotent progenitor cells.", "citedTitle": "Structurally specific heparan sulfates support primitive human hematopoiesis by formation of a multimolecular stem cell niche."}

The enzymatic activity of TRAF6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is thought to have a pivotal role in triggering these processes. In this paper, we reexamined this assumption by generating mice expressing a catalytically inactive mutant of TRAF6. The bone structure of the mice was normal and a major intracellular signaling pathway of the immune system could still be switched on. We found that other E3 ligases, Pellino1 and Pellino2, could generate the ubiquitin chains needed to switch on immune signaling in human cells expressing catalytically inactive TRAF6. Our findings identify essential roles of TRAF6 that are independent of its enzymatic activity. It is widely accepted that the essential role of TRAF6 in vivo is to generate the Lys63-linked ubiquitin (K63-Ub) chains needed to activate the \u201cmaster\u201d protein kinase TAK1. Here, we report that TRAF6 E3 ligase activity contributes to but is not essential for the IL-1\u2013dependent formation of K63-Ub chains, TAK1 activation, or IL-8 production in human cells, because Pellino1 and Pellino2 generate the K63-Ub chains required for signaling in cells expressing E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6 mutants.

The reexpression of E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6 mutants partially restored IL-1 signaling in TRAF6 KO cells, but not in TRAF6/Pellino1/Pellino2 triple-KO cells. Pellino1-generated K63-Ub chains activated the TAK1 complex in vitro with similar efficiently to TRAF6-generated K63-Ub chains. The early phase of TLR signaling and the TLR-dependent secretion of IL-10 (controlled by IRAKs 1 and 2) was only reduced modestly in primary macrophages from knockin mice expressing the E3 ligase-inactive TRAF6[L74H] mutant, but the late-phase production of IL-6, IL-12, and TNF\u03b1 (controlled only by the pseudokinase IRAK2) was abolished. RANKL-induced signaling in macrophages and the differentiation of bone marrow to osteoclasts was similar in TRAF6[L74H] and wild-type cells, explaining why the bone structure and teeth of the TRAF6[L74H] mice was normal, unlike TRAF6 KO mice.

Unexpectedly, this region of TRAF6 is dimeric both in the crystal and in solution, different from the trimeric C-terminal TRAF domain. Structure-based mutagenesis reveals that TRAF6 dimerization is crucial for polyubiquitin synthesis and autoubiquitination.

This was first evidenced for HPV5 and 8 in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV), a genetic skin disease. So far, it has been unknown how these viruses overcome cutaneous immune control allowing their persistence in lesional epidermis of these patients. Here we demonstrate that Langerhans cells, essential for skin immunosurveillance, are strongly reduced in HPV8-positive lesional epidermis from EV patients. Interestingly, the same lesions were largely devoid of the important Langerhans cells chemoattractant protein CCL20. Applying bioinformatic tools, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and functional studies we identified the differentiation-associated transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2) as a critical regulator of CCL20 gene expression in normal human keratinocytes. The physiological relevance of this finding is supported by our in vivo studies showing that the expression patterns of CCL20 and nuclear C/EBP\u03b2 converge spatially in the most differentiated layers of human epidermis. Our analyses further identified C/EBP\u03b2 as a novel target of the HPV8 E7 oncoprotein, which co-localizes with C/EBP\u03b2 in the nucleus, co-precipitates with it and interferes with its binding to the CCL20 promoter in vivo. As a consequence, the HPV8 E7 but not E6 oncoprotein suppressed C/EBP\u03b2-inducible and constitutive CCL20 gene expression as well as Langerhans cell migration.

The hit-and-run model of transcriptional control maintains that transcription complexes are assembled in a stochastic fashion from freely diffusible proteins; this contrasts to models involving stepwise assembly of stable holo complexes. However, the chances of forming a productive complex improve if the binding of one factor promotes the binding of its interactors. We prove here that in living cells, the glucocorticoid receptor and HMGB1 interact only within chromatin and not in the nucleoplasm and decrease each other's mobility.

A highly conserved 5\u2032 noncoding exon, exon 1c, is present in vertebrates from fish to mammals and appears to define the ancestral promoter region. The distance from exon 1c to the first coding exon increased tenfold during vertebrate evolution, largely by insertion of repetitive elements. The mammalian gene acquired three novel, mutually exclusive noncoding exons that are not represented in the lower vertebrates. Within the shared exon 1c, we identified four short sequence elements of 10-20 bp with an unusually high level of evolutionary conservation. The conserved elements are most similar to consensus sites for the transcription factors Pou6f1/Brn5, YY1, and REST/NRSF. Introduction of mutations into the predicted Pou6f1 and REST sites reduced promoter activity in transfected neuronal cells.

Discrete optimal transport provides a natural and successful approach to such tasks whenever the two sets of objects can be represented in the same space, or at least distances between them can be directly evaluated. Unfortunately neither requirement is likely to hold when object representations are learned from data. Indeed, automatically derived representations such as word embeddings are typically fixed only up to some global transformations, for example, reflection or rotation. As a result, pairwise distances across two such instances are ill-defined without specifying their relative transformation. In this work, we propose a general framework for optimal transport in the presence of latent global transformations.

Without using any character information, our model even outperforms existing supervised methods on cross-lingual tasks for some language pairs.

HE occurs in older individuals and more frequently in those with known hypertension. More patients with HE had dyslipidemia than those with HU (58% vs. 38%). The diastolic BP and heart rate were higher in the HE group (120 mmHg and 87 bpm) compared to ContrHT (71 mmHg and 71 bpm; p < 0.0001) and NT groups (75 mmHg and 68 bpm; p < 0.0001). Glycemia was higher in HE vs. NT and ContrHT (p < 0.05). HDL cholesterol was lower in HE than NT (p = 0.0088). Potassium was lower in HE vs. NT, ContrHT and HU groups (p < 0.05). Creatinine was higher in the HC group vs. NT and ContrHT (p < 0.05). The GFR was significantly lower in HE group vs. HU, ContrHT and NT (p < 0.001).

This study aimed to evaluate whether CT screening in urban areas of China could reduce lung cancer mortality and to investigate the factors that associate with the screening effect.MethodsA decision tree model with three scenarios (low-dose CT screening, chest X-ray screening, and no screening) was developed to compare screening results in a simulated Chinese urban cohort (100,000 smokers aged 45\u201380\u00a0years). Data of participant characteristics were obtained from national registries and epidemiological surveys for estimating lung cancer prevalence. The selection of other tree variables such as sensitivities and specificities of low-dose CT and chest X-ray screening were based on literature research. Differences in lung cancer mortality (primary outcome), false diagnoses, and deaths due to false diagnosis were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the factors that associate with the screening results and to ascertain worst and optimal screening effects considering possible ranges of the variables.ResultsAmong the 100,000 subjects, there were 448, 541, and 591 lung cancer deaths in the low-dose CT, chest X-ray, and no screening scenarios, respectively (17.2% reduction in low-dose CT screening over chest X-ray screening and 24.2% over no screening). The costs of the two screening scenarios were 9387 and 2497 false diagnoses and 7 and 2 deaths due to false diagnosis among the 100,000 persons, respectively. The factors that most influenced death reduction with low-dose CT screening over no screening were lung cancer prevalence in the screened cohort, low-dose CT sensitivity, and proportion of early-stage cancers among low-dose CT detected lung cancers. Considering all possibilities, reduction in deaths (relative numbers) with low-dose CT screening in the worst and optimal cases were 16 (5.4%) and 288 (40.2%) over no screening, respectively.ConclusionsIn terms of mortality outcomes, our findings favor conducting low-dose CT screening in urban China.

The advent of low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) altered the landscape of lung-cancer screening, with studies indicating that low-dose CT detects many tumors at early stages. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) was conducted to determine whether screening with low-dose CT could reduce mortality from lung cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom August 2002 through April 2004, we enrolled 53,454 persons at high risk for lung cancer at 33 U.S. medical centers. Participants were randomly assigned to undergo three annual screenings with either low-dose CT (26,722 participants) or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography (26,732). Data were collected on cases of lung cancer and deaths from lung cancer that occurred through December 31, 2009.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe rate of adherence to screening was more than 90%. The rate of positive screening tests was 24.2% with low-dose CT and 6.9% with radiography over all three rounds. A total of 96.4% of the positive screening results in the low-dose CT group and 94.5% in the radiography group were false positive results. The incidence of lung cancer was 645 cases per 100,000 person-years (1060 cancers) in the low-dose CT group, as compared with 572 cases per 100,000 person-years (941 cancers) in the radiography group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.23). There were 247 deaths from lung cancer per 100,000 person-years in the low-dose CT group and 309 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the radiography group, representing a relative reduction in mortality from lung cancer with low-dose CT screening of 20.0% (95% CI, 6.8 to 26.7; P=0.004). The rate of death from any cause was reduced in the low-dose CT group, as compared with the radiography group, by 6.7% (95% CI, 1.2 to 13.6; P=0.02).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nScreening with the use of low-dose CT reduces mortality from lung cancer.

Some novices may see this as presenting the opportunity for a glorious free-for-all, releasing them from the constraints of the quantitative research game. In the midst of their new-found freedom, they may then find themselves accosted by experienced players who seem to have, after all, a definite set of rules. On being challenged, experienced players may then explain that, while there are only general principles, these are interpreted in a quite specific way depending on the particular context within which the game is being played. 'Context' becomes the bugbear for the novice. The novice may even have to learn that, before booting the ball through the goal posts, the player has to take account of where the ball is coming from, where it wants to go and what meaning it, the ball, attaches to the experience of being kicked! Freedom readily gives way to frustration and incomprehension. Happily, there are some brave researchers who set about the task of making the rules of qualitative research explicit to novices and to experienced players. The three books reviewed here fall into that category. They all take on a different task. The collection of articles brought together in one edition by Janice Morse is not about the rules but about some exciting games that have been played. Together the articles demonstrate not only the pleasures of the qualitative research game, but also its contribution to a fine, detailed understanding of important health prob-", "citingTitle": "STANDARDIZATION AND KM : EVALUATING KNOWLEDGE QUALITY", "citedTitle": "Qualitative Research Methods"}

For the support vector machine, an efficient and general multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithm, based on semi-infinite linear progamming, has been recently proposed. This approach has opened new perspectives since it makes the MKL approach tractable for large-scale problems, by iteratively using existing support vector machine code. However, it turns out that this iterative algorithm needs numerous iterations for converging towards a reasonable solution. In this paper, we address the MKL problem through an adaptive 2-norm regularization formulation that encourages sparse kernel combinations. Apart from learning the combination, we solve a standard SVM optimization problem, where the kernel is defined as a linear combination of multiple kernels. We propose an algorithm, named SimpleMKL, for solving this MKL problem and provide a new insight on MKL algorithms based on mixed-norm regularization by showing that the two approaches are equivalent. Furthermore, we show how SimpleMKL can be applied beyond binary classification, for problems like regression, clustering (one-class classification) or multiclass classification. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm converges rapidly and that its efficiency compares favorably to other MKL algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of MKL for some regressors based on wavelet kernels and on some model selection problems related to multiclass classification problems.

To quantify many important diagnostic parameters, such as ventricular volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output, an automatic algorithm to delineate the left ventricle (LV) from RT3D echocardiographic images is essential. While a number of efforts have been made towards segmentation of the LV endocardial (ENDO) boundaries, the segmentation of epicardial (EPI) boundaries remains problematic. In this paper, we present a coupled deformable model that addresses this problem. The idea behind our method is that the volume of the myocardium is close to being constant during a cardiac cycle and our model uses this coupling as an important constraint. We employ two surfaces, each driven by the image-derived information that takes into account ultrasound physics by modeling the speckle statistics using the Nakagami distribution while maintaining the coupling. By simultaneously evolving two surfaces, the final segmentation of the myocardium is thus achieved. Results from 80 sets of synthetic data and 286 sets of real canine data were evaluated against the ground truth and against outlines from three independent observers, respectively. We show that results obtained with our incompressibility constraint were more accurate than those obtained without constraint or with a wall thickness constraint, and were comparable to those from manual segmentation.", "citedAbstract": "This study investigated the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) for image segmentation and spatial temporal contour linking for the detection of endocardial contours on echocardiographic images.

The ANN system was then applied to parasternal short axis images of 38 patients. Spatial temporal contour linking was performed on the segmented images to extract endocardial boarders. Left ventricular areas (end-systolic and end-diastolic) determined with the automated system were calculated and compared to results obtained by manual contour tracing performed by two independent investigators. In addition, ejection fractions (EF) were derived using the area-length method and compared with radionuclide ventriculography. Image quality was classified as good in 12 (32%), moderate in 13 (34%) and poor in 13 (34%) patients. The ANN system provided estimates of end-diastolic and end-systolic areas in 36 (89%) of echocardiograms, which correlated well with those obtained by manual tracing (R = 0.99, SEE = 1.44). A good agreement was also found for the comparison of EF between the ANN system and Tc-radionuclide ventriculography (RNV, R = 0.93, SEE = 6.36). The ANN system also performed well in the subset of patients with poor image quality.

The similarity to prokaryotic PRAC and the absence in Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma congolense have raised many questions about the origin, evolution, and functions of trypanosome PRAC (TryPRAC) enzymes.FindingsWe identified TryPRAC homologs as single copy genes per haploid genome in 12 of 15 Trypanosoma species, including T. cruzi and T. cruzi marinkellei, T. dionisii, T. erneyi, T. rangeli, T. conorhini and T. lewisi, all parasites of mammals. Polymorphisms in TcPRAC genes matched T. cruzi genotypes: TcI-TcIV and Tcbat have unique genes, while the hybrids TcV and TcVI contain TcPRACA and TcPRACB from parental TcII and TcIII, respectively. PRAC homologs were identified in trypanosomes from anurans, snakes, crocodiles, lizards, and birds. Most trypanosomes have intact PRAC genes. T. rangeli possesses only pseudogenes, maybe in the process of being lost.

This finding, together with the synteny of PRAC loci, the relationships with prokaryotic PRAC inferred by taxon-rich phylogenetic analysis, and the absence in trypanosomatids of any other genera or in bodonids or euglenids suggest that a common ancestor of Trypanosoma gained PRAC gene by a single and ancient horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from a Firmicutes bacterium more closely related to Gemella and other species of Bacilli than to Clostridium as previously suggested. Our broad phylogenetic study allowed investigation of TryPRAC evolution over long and short timescales.

The composting of TPOMW followed the common pattern reported previously for this kind of material with a reduction of 40-50% of organic matter, a gradual increase in pH, disappearance of phytotoxicity and formation of humic-like C.

Late Precambrian crustal evolution in the Northeastern Desert of Egypt culminated in a major episode of strong extension, accompanied by bimodal igneous activity and deposition of clastic sediments in restricted terrigenous basins. These sediments, known as the Hammamat Series, record the uncovering of the evolving crust of the region.

To evaluate contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and compare it to ultrasound (US) and 64-slice-CT (64-CT) for diagnosing, staging and evaluation of resectability of pancreatic cancer. Material and methods. US, CEUS and 64-CT were performed in 49 consecutive patients with pancreatic head tumors and with suspected cancer. After evaluation 44 patients had pancreatic head adenocarcinoma and 5 had chronic pancreatitis, all confirmed by histology. Results. The sensitivity of US, CEUS and 64-CT for diagnosing malignant pancreatic head tumors was 89%, 86% and 93%, respectively, and the overall accuracy was 82%, 86% and 88% respectively. There was no significant difference in the malignant tumor size measurement between US and CEUS (p = 0.3619) or between US and 64-CT (p = 0.2129), but a significant difference was seen in the size measured by CEUS and 64-CT (p = 0.0197).

Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. Applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. Recent activity in this field concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. Designing dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a pre-specified set of linear transforms, or by adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. Both these techniques have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations. Given a set of training signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints.

Gamma interferon (IFN-\u03b3) is a key mediator of host antiviral immunity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism by which these antiviral cytokines suppress HBV replication remains elusive. Using an immortalized murine hepatocyte (AML12)-derived cell line supporting tetracycline-inducible HBV replication, we show in this report that both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 efficiently reduce the amount of intracellular HBV nucleocapsids. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that the IFN-induced cellular antiviral response is able to distinguish and selectively accelerate the decay of HBV replication-competent nucleocapsids but not empty capsids in a proteasome-dependent manner. Our findings thus reveal a novel antiviral mechanism of IFNs and provide a basis for a better understanding of HBV pathobiology.", "citedAbstract": "Hepatocytes are extensively used in studies of gene regulation but cannot be maintained in long-term culture as replicating, differentiated cells while remaining nontumorigenic. We have derived two hepatocyte lines from livers of transgenic mice overexpressing transforming growth factor alpha, a potent hepatocyte mitogen, which overcome these limitations. The transgenic hepatocytes were maintained for > or = 2 months in serum-supplemented primary culture and gave rise to cell lines, of which two (AML12 and AML14) have been cultured for > 1.5 years (> 80 passages). Both lines have typical hepatocyte features such as peroxisomes and bile canalicular-like structures, do not grow in soft agar, and are nontumorigenic in nude mice. Like normal hepatocytes, AML cells express high levels of mRNA for serum (albumin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and transferrin) and gap junction (connexins 26 and 32) proteins, secrete albumin, and contain solely isozyme 5 of lactate dehydrogenase. After extensive passaging, AML12 cells continue to strongly coexpress hepatocyte connexin mRNAs but do not display nonparenchymal cell markers. Although mRNA levels for some serum proteins progressively fall, high expression in late AML12 cultures may be regained by passage in serum-free medium. The AML14 line loses expression of both differentiated markers and transgene mRNA with extended passaging, and hepatocytic traits are only partially restored by passage in serum-free medium.

It has already been shown that old drugs like sulfasalazine (SAS) and valproic acid (VPA) present antitumoral activities in glioma cell lines. SAS has also been associated with a decrease of intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels through a potent inhibition of xc- glutamate/cystine exchanger leading to an antioxidant deprotection. In the same way, VPA was recently identified as a histone deacetylase (HDAT) inhibitor capable of activating tumor suppression genes. As both drugs are widely used in clinical practice and their profile of adverse effects is well known, the aim of our study was to investigate the effects of the combined treatment with SAS and VPA in GBM cell lines. We observed that both drugs were able to reduce cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and the combined treatment potentiated these effects. Combined treatment also increased cell death and inhibited proliferation of GBM cells, while having no effect on human and rat cultured astrocytes. Also, we observed high protein expression of the catalytic subunit of xc- in all the examined GBM cell lines, and treatment with SAS blocked its activity and decreased intracellular GSH levels. Noteworthy, SAS but not VPA was also able to reduce the [14C]-ascorbate uptake.

In this study, we evaluated the potential synergistic effect of TMZ and VPA in human glioma cell lines. Compared with the use of TMZ or VPA alone, concurrent treatment with both drugs synergistically induced apoptosis in U87MG cells as evidenced by p53 and Bax expression, mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss, reactive oxygen species production, and glutathione depletion. This synergistic effect correlated with a decrease in nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor and corresponded with reduced heme oxygenase-1 and \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase expression. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine partially recovered the apoptotic effect of the TMZ/VPA combination treatment. The same degree of synergism is also seen in p53-mutant Hs683 cells, which indicates that p53 may not play a major role in the increased proapoptotic effect of the TMZ/VPA combination. In conclusion, VPA enhanced the apoptotic effect of TMZ, possibly through a redox regulation mechanism.

The family of SOCS proteins is divided into two groups: ancestral and vertebrate-specific SOCS proteins. Vertebrate-specific SOCS proteins have been heavily studied as a result of their strong mutant phenotypes. However, the ancestral clade remains less studied, a potential result of genetic redundancies in mammals. Use of the genetically tractable organism Drosophila melanogaster enables in vivo assessment of signaling components and mechanisms with less concern about the functional redundancy observed in mammals. In this study, we investigated how the SOCS family member Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling at 36E (Socs36E) attenuates Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (Jak/STAT) activation during specification of motile border cells in Drosophila oogenesis. We found that Socs36E genetically interacts with the Cullin2 (Cul2) scaffolding protein. Like Socs36E, Cul2 is required to limit the number of motile cells in egg chambers. We demonstrated that loss of Cul2 in the follicle cells significantly increased nuclear STAT protein levels, which resulted in additional cells acquiring invasive properties. Further, reduction of Cul2 suppressed border cell migration defects that occur in a Stat92E-sensitized genetic background. Our data incorporated Cul2 into a previously described Jak/STAT-directed genetic regulatory network that is required to generate a discrete boundary between cell fates. We also found that Socs36E is able to attenuate STAT activity in the egg chamber when it does not have a functional SOCS box. Collectively, this work contributes mechanistic insight to a Jak/STAT regulatory genetic circuit, and suggests that Socs36E regulates Jak/STAT signaling via a Cul2-dependent mechanism, as well as by a Cullin-independent manner, in vivo.", "citedAbstract": "Patterns of cell fates generated by morphogens are critically important for normal development; however, the mechanisms by which graded morphogen signals are converted into all-or-none cell fate responses are incompletely understood.

A lower or transient level of STAT activity specifies a non-migratory population of follicle cells. Here we identify miR-279 as a component of a feedback pathway that further dampens the response in cells with low levels of JAK/STAT activity. miR-279 directly repressed STAT, and loss of miR-279 mimicked STAT gain-of-function or loss of Apontic (Apt), a known feedback inhibitor of STAT. Apt was essential for miR-279 expression in non-migratory follicle cells, whereas another STAT target, Ken and Barbie (Ken), downregulated miR-279 in border cells.

The MID task was configured to temporally disentangle potential reward or potential loss anticipation-related brain signal from reward or loss notification-related signal. Subjects saw cues signaling opportunities to win or avoid losing $0, $.50, or $5 for responding quickly to a subsequent target. Subjects then viewed feedback of their trial success after a variable interval from cue presentation of between 6 to17 s. Adolescents showed reduced NAcc recruitment by reward-predictive cues compared to adult controls in a linear contrast with non-incentive cues, and in a volume-of-interest analysis of signal change in the NAcc. In contrast, adolescents showed little difference in striatal and frontocortical responsiveness to reward deliveries compared to adults. Conclusions/Significance In light of divergent developmental difference findings between neuroimaging incentive paradigms (as well as at different stages within the same task), these data suggest that maturational differences in incentive-motivational neurocircuitry: 1) may be sensitive to nuances of incentive tasks or stimuli, such as behavioral or learning contingencies, and 2) may be specific to the component of the instrumental behavior (such as anticipation versus notification).", "citedAbstract": "Adolescence is a developmental period that entails substantial changes in affective and incentive-seeking behavior relative to both childhood and adulthood, including a heightened propensity to engage in risky behaviors and experience persistent negative and labile mood states.

Methods: A total of 60 consecutive DTC patients (51 papillary thyroid Ca., and 9 Follicular thyroid Ca.), underwent total thyroidectomy, followed by WBS (using I-131 in 28 patients and I-123 in 32 patients), neck ultrasound (US), thyroglobulin (Tg) and Tg anti-bodies (TgAb) assay after 40 days and subsequent I-131 ablation.

One of the readers was unblinded and had access to clinical, imaging, histologic, and biochemical information.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPlanar scans depicted 130 neck foci and 17 distant foci. At SPECT/CT these foci were further characterized as thyroglossal duct and thyroid bed remnant (n = 98), cervical nodal metastasis or local residual disease (n = 26), physiologic activity (n = 11), and distant metastasis (n = 12).

The SSRI fluvoxamine maleate (100 mol/l) was applied locally at the anastomotic site to compare with the 5-HT4 agonist mosapride citrate (100 mol/l) (applied for patent) applied locally and orally. Unlike mosapride, fluvoxamine failed to promote the regeneration of the nerve fiber tract across the anastomosis. Furthermore, fluvoxamine did not generate antidistal-less homeobox 2 (DLX2)and anti-SR4-positive cells (neural stem cells) and/or anti-neurofilament (NF)-positive cells (neural cells) in newly formed granulation tissue at the anastomosis, whereas these cell types were observed in mosapride-treated preparations. In contrast to its effects in guinea pigs, mosapride generated 5-bromo-2=-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive neural cells in ganglia sites 3 mm oral and anal from the anastomosis 2 wk after nerve fiber injury. All actions of mosapride were observed after local and or oral applications. These findings indicate that local SSRI treatment does not induce in vivo nerve fiber tract growth across the anastomosis in the rat distal gut. Mosapride induces nerve fiber tract growth across the anastomosis, mediated through enteric neural stem cells possibly from neural crest-derived stem cells or mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow.", "citedAbstract": "Moderate rectal distension elicits recto-rectal reflex contractions and simultaneous recto-internal anal sphincter reflex relaxations that together comprise the defecation reflex.

The siring of offspring by an extrapair male, or extrapair paternity (EPP), is a widespread and varied phenomenon in all vertebrate classes. However, we do not understand all of the factors associated with variation in EPP rates. The breeding synchrony hypothesis suggests that EPP rates should increase with latitude and elevation, whereas the paternal care hypothesis predicts that EPP rates should decrease with elevation. To address these hypotheses, we investigated how population EPP rates vary over elevation and latitude in emberizid sparrows. In comparative analyses including the effects of phylogeny, the relationship between EPP rates and elevation depended on latitude. EPP rates were greater in higher-latitude populations. But within higher-latitude populations, EPP rates decreased with increasing elevation. These findings provide support for both the breeding synchrony and paternal care hypotheses, suggesting that in lower-latitude, higher-elevation populations, the need for male parental care does not outweigh the benefits of seeking extrapair fertilizations in populations with relatively synchronous breeding. In contrast, at higher-latitude, higher-elevation sites, the need for male parental care is greater and might drive lower rates of extrapair mating despite highly synchronous breeding.", "citedAbstract": "Comprehensive, accurate paternity assignment is critical to answering numerous questions in evolutionary ecology. Yet, most studies of species with extra\u2010pair paternity (EPP) fail to assign sires to all offspring. Common limitations include incomplete and biased sampling of offspring and males, particularly with respect to male location and social status, potentially biasing estimated patterns of paternity.

Accordingly, we genotyped virtually all males and >99% of 6\u2010day\u2010old offspring over 16\u2003years in a song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) population and used three complementary statistical methodologies to attempt complete paternity assignment for all 2207 offspring.

Sires were assigned to >99% of all genotyped offspring with \u226595% confidence, revealing an EPP rate of c. 28%. Extra\u2010pair sires primarily occupied territories neighbouring their extra\u2010pair offspring; spatial location was therefore highly informative for paternity assignment. EPP was biased towards paired territorial males, although unpaired territorial and floater males sired c. 13% of extra\u2010pair offspring. Failing to sample and include unpaired males as candidate sires would therefore substantially reduce assignment rates. These analyses demonstrate the integration of genetic and ecological information to achieve comprehensive paternity assignment and direct biological insight, illustrate the potential biases that common forms of incomplete sampling could have on estimated patterns of EPP, and provide an essential basis for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of EPP.", "citingTitle": "Extrapair Paternity Rates Vary with Latitude and Elevation in Emberizid Sparrows", "citedTitle": "Comprehensive paternity assignment: genotype, spatial location and social status in song sparrows, Melospiza Melodia"}

We aimed to characterize the expression and function of S100A8/A9 in patients with typhoid fever and in a murine invasive Salmonella model. Methods and principal findings S100A8/A9 protein levels were determined in acute phase plasma or feces from 28 Bangladeshi patients, and convalescent phase plasma from 60 Indonesian patients with blood culture or PCR-confirmed typhoid fever, and compared to 98 healthy control subjects. To functionally characterize the role of S100A8/A9, we challenged wildtype (WT) and S100A9-/- mice with S. Typhimurium and determined bacterial loads and inflammation 2- and 5- days post infection. We further assessed the antimicrobial function of recombinant S100A8/A9 on S. Typhimurium and S. Typhi replication in vitro. Typhoid fever patients demonstrated a marked increase of S100A8/A9 in acute phase plasma and feces and this increases correlated with duration of fever prior to admission. S100A8/A9 directly inhibited the growth of S. Typhimurium and S. Typhi in vitro in a dose and time dependent fashion. WT mice inoculated with S.

The importance of protein aggregation in viral pathogenesis has been recognized; however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain ill-defined. Transactive response DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) is an RNA-binding protein that has an essential role in regulating RNA metabolism at multiple levels. Cleavage and cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 serves as a major molecular marker for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration and contributes significantly to disease progression. In this study, we reported that TDP-43 is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during CVB3 infection through the activity of viral protease 2A, followed by the cleavage mediated by viral protease 3C. Cytoplasmic translocation of TDP-43 is accompanied by reduced solubility and increased formation of protein aggregates. The cleavage takes place at amino-acid 327 between glutamine and alanine, resulting in the generation of an N- and C-terminal cleavage fragment of ~35 and ~8\u2009kDa, respectively. The C-terminal product of TDP-43 is unstable and quickly degraded through the proteasome degradation pathway, whereas the N-terminal truncation of TDP-43 acts as a dominant-negative mutant that inhibits the function of native TDP-43 in alternative RNA splicing. Lastly, we demonstrated that knockdown of TDP-43 results in an increase in viral titers, suggesting a protective role for TDP-43 in CVB3 infection.

It has been suggested that some molecules present in the oviductal fluid and cells as well as proteins present in the cumulus oophorus could be involved in the modulation of sperm function and their acquisition of fertilizing capacity. Fibronectin is a glycoprotein that is present in the fluid and the oviduct epithelium, and its receptor (alpha 5 beta 1 integrin) is present in human sperm. When alpha 5 beta 1 (\u03b15\u03b21) integrin binds to fibronectin, intracellular signals similar to the process of sperm capacitation are activated.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION\nHuman sperm were selected via a percoll gradient and were then incubated in non-capacitated medium (NCM) or reconstituted capacitated medium (RCM), in the presence or absence of fibronectin for different time periods. A total of 39 donors were used during the study, which lasted 3 years.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS\nFreshly ejaculated sperm from healthy volunteers were obtained by masturbation. All semen samples were normal according to the World Health Organization parameters. Six approaches were used to determine the effects of fibronectin on sperm capacitation: chlortetracycline (CTC) assay, heterologous co-culture of human sperm with bovine oviductal epithelial cells (BOEC), measurement of cyclic (c) AMP levels, activity of protein kinase A (PKA), phosphorylation of proteins in tyrosine (Tyr) residues, and induction of acrosome reaction with progesterone.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE\nWhen sperm were incubated in RCM in the presence of Fn, we observed differences with respect to sperm incubated in RCM without Fn (control): (i) a 10% increase in the percentage of sperm with the B pattern (capacitated sperm) of CTC fluorescence from the beginning of capacitation (P < 0.001); (ii) an effect on both the concentration of cAMP (P < 0.05) and PKA activity (P < 0.05) during early capacitation; (iii) an increase in the degree of phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues after 60 min of capacitation (P < 0.01); (iv) an increase in the percentage of acrosome-reacted sperm in response to progesterone (P < 0.05); and (v) a decrease in the percentage of sperm attached to BOEC (P < 0.05). Moreover, we noted that the effect of Fn was specific and mediated by alpha 5 beta 1 integrin (P < 0.001). Fn by itself had no effect on sperm capacitation.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION\nThis study was carried out with sperm from young adult men. Men with abnormal semen samples were excluded. The results cannot be directly extrapolated to other mammalian species.\n\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS\nCurrently, male subfertility has become a huge public health problem, which makes it imperative to develop new treatments. This is a novel discovery that extends our current knowledge concerning normal and pathological sperm physiology as well as events that regulate the process of fertilization.\n\n\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS\nThis study was supported by grants from FONDECYT (1130341, E.S.D. and 1120056, P.M.) and FONCYT (PIP 2011-0496, S.P.-M).

When human sperm were incubated in a medium supporting capacitation, proteins became tyrosine-phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner. This phosphorylation was inhibited by genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Phosphorylation was also reduced when sperm were incubated either in the presence of increasing concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ or in a medium containing the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. This Ca2+-induced dephosphorylation was calmodulin-dependent, suggesting that calcineurin was involved. In this regard, the calcineurin inhibitor deltamethrin inhibited the Ca2+ ionophore-induced dephosphorylation. A limited number of Mr 80,000-105,000 polypeptides were the most prominent phosphotyrosine-containing proteins present in human sperm. Unlike mouse sperm, which contains a tyrosine-phosphorylated isoform of hexokinase, a phosphotyrosine-containing hexokinase in human sperm was not detected. Most of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were Triton X-100-insoluble and were localized to the principal piece of the flagellum, the region where the cytoskeletal fibrous sheath is found. Prominent phosphotyrosine-containing proteins of Mr 82,000 and 97,000 were identified as the human homologues of mouse sperm AKAP82, the major fibrous sheath protein, and pro-AKAP82, its precursor polypeptide, respectively. These proteins are A Kinase Anchor Proteins, polypeptides that sequester protein kinase A to subcellular locations.

In particular, we examine the model that modulations in CPA factor concentration may affect APA during development. For this, we first analyse the expression of the Drosophila orthologues of all mammalian CPA factors and note that their expression decreases during embryogenesis. In contrast to this global developmental decrease in CPA factor expression, we see that cleavage factor I (CFI) expression is actually elevated in the late embryonic central nervous system, suggesting that CFI might play a special role in neural tissues. To test this, we use the UAS/Gal4 system to deplete CFI proteins from neural tissue and observe that in this condition, multiple genes switch their APA patterns, demonstrating a role of CFI in APA control during Drosophila neural development. Furthermore, analysis of genes with 3\u2032UTR extensions of different length leads us to suggest a novel relation between 3\u2032UTR length and sensitivity to CPA factor expression.

The extirpation of ground squirrels from the boreal forest (Gillis et al. 2005; Donker and Krebs 2011), poor active-season survival, low recruitment rates, immigration from nearby low elevation-meadow habitat and population growth rates <1.0 provide convincing evidence that the boreal forest functions as a sink habitat for arctic ground squirrels.

Variable demographic rates can manifest themselves between habitat types in the form of source\u2013sink dynamics where populations in sink habitats would not exist without the addition of migrants from source habitats. Aims. Arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii pleisus (Osgood, 1900)) occupy a large geographic area in northern Canada and live in a variety of habitat types, including boreal forest, low-elevation meadows and alpine meadows, providing an opportunity to investigate the possible existence of source\u2013sink dynamics. Methods. We hypothesised that arctic ground squirrels in the south-western Yukon exhibit demographic characteristics indicative of source\u2013sink dynamics. Boreal forest habitat could be a sink in spite of previous high squirrel densities, whereas meadows could be a source. We investigated this by mark\u2013recapture live-trapping and radio-telemetry. Key Results. In the boreal forest in the Kluane region, we found reduced recruitment, reduced population growth rates (\u03bb), and reduced survivorship for radio-collared individuals that moved from low-elevation meadows into the boreal forest. There was no evidence from radio-collared juveniles of dispersal from high-density ground squirrel populations in alpine meadows down into boreal forest. Conclusions. Boreal forest is a sink habitat for arctic ground squirrels. Source\u2013sink dynamics observed between low-elevation meadow and boreal forest habitats appear to result from increased predation pressure in the boreal forest. The result has been a near extirpation of boreal forest arctic ground squirrels in the Kluane region since 1998. Implications. Because the source areas of low-elevation meadows occupy only 7\u20139% of the lowland habitat, recolonisation of boreal forest sites has been very slow. Whereas alpine populations remain high in 2011, boreal forest populations remain near zero. Alpine populations do not appear to be a source for the boreal forest.", "citedAbstract": "Nous avons etudie les sousliks arctiques (Urocitellus parryii plesius (Osgood, 1900); anterieurement Spermophilus parryii plesius Osgood, 1900) dans trois types d'habitat distincts (la foret boreale, les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines) dans la region de Kluane dans le sud-ouest du territoire du Yukon, Canada, de 2008 a 2010, afin de determiner si les populations de ces differents habitats presentaient des repartitions et des abondances specifiques aux habitats.

MT1-MMP is critical for pericellular degradation of the extracellular matrix, thereby promoting tumor cell invasion and dissemination. To grow efficiently in vivo, tumor cells induce angiogenesis in both primary solid tumors and metastatic foci. The present study describes a functional link between the expression of MT1-MMP and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in human glioma U251 xenografts in athymic mice. To investigate the effects of MT1-MMP on VEGF expression, U251 cells were stably transfected with MT1-MMP to generate the U-MT cell line overexpressing the enzyme. In vitro, the U-MT cells had an increased rate of proliferation and migration as well as the ability to activate the MMP-2 proenzyme and directionally remodel a three-dimensional collagen matrix. These findings suggested higher tumorigenicity of U-MT cells relative to the vector-control U-neo cells. In agreement with the in vitro data, U-MT xenografts in BALB/c nu/nu mice displayed markedly increased growth rates and elevated levels of angiogenesis. In contrast, U-neo cells formed small, minimally vascularized tumors. The elevated angiogenesis in U-MT xenografts was associated with an up-regulation of VEGF expression in tumor cells. In addition, U-MT cells in vitro secreted twice as much VEGF as the control cells. GM6001, a hydroxamate inhibitor of MMP activity, down-regulated the production of VEGF in U-MT cells to the levels observed in the U-neo control. Our results demonstrate that the enhanced tumorigenicity of glioma cells overexpressing MT1-MMP involves stimulation of angiogenesis through the up-regulation of VEGF production.", "citedAbstract": "Angiogenesis is the process in which new vessels emerge from existing endothelial lined vessels. This is distinct from the process of vasculogenesis in that the endothelial cells arise by proliferation from existing vessels rather than differentiating from stem cells. Angiogenesis is an invasive process that requires proteolysis of the extracellular matrix and, proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, as well as synthesis of new matrix components. During embryonic development, both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis contribute to formation of the circulatory system. In the adult, with the single exception of the reproductive cycle in women, angiogenesis is initiated only in response to a pathologic condition, such as inflammation or hypoxia. The angiogenic response is critical for progression of wound healing and rheumatoid arthritis. Angiogenesis is also a prerequisite for tumor growth and metastasis formation. Therefore, understanding the cellular events involved in angiogenesis and the molecular regulation of these events has enormous clinical implications.

The objective was to systematically combine the published data. Design and setting: Cases were identified by MEDLINE search and review of bibliographies. Patients: We included subjects reported with HIT, collecting patient demographics, clinical and laboratory characteristics, therapeutic regimens and outcomes. Measurements and results: Reports on 70 patients were retrieved. In a majority of children, HIT occurred during hospitalisation in a paediatric ICU. In most patients, the typical onset pattern was reported, although rapid-onset-pattern HIT occurred in some. The median platelet-count nadir was 54\u00d7109/l; 11% of reported patients had nadirs in the normal range. Clinical symptoms included isolated thrombocytopenia and solitary or combined venous, arterial and intracardiac thromboembolism, sometimes catheter-related. Pulmonary embolism and major bleeding were rarely described. Confirmatory functional or antigenic testing of HIT antibodies showed a similar cumulative sensitivity of about 88%. An unfavourable outcome (death/limb amputation) was reported in 42.1% of patients without therapy and in 18% of patients treated with danaparoid, lepirudin, or argatroban. Conclusions: HIT in children mainly occurs in paediatric intensive care with diagnostic features and outcomes similar to those seen in adults. HIT cannot be ruled out based on normal platelet counts or occurrence after fewer than 5 days of heparin exposure.

We found that hemodynamic activity can be expressed as the sum of two components, one local and one global. The local component reflected presumed neural signals driven by visual stimuli in the appropriate retinotopic region. The global component constituted large fluctuations shared by larger cortical regions, which extend beyond visual cortex.

Clinical use of these biomarkers in critically ill patients being treated in intensive care is not well established. Methods: This is a narrative review of evidence identified searching MEDLINE with the strategy [(BNP OR NT-proBNP) AND (critical illness AND intensive care)]. Seven primary reports and two narrative reviews were retrieved. For completeness, literature from each of the following searches was reviewed: [(BNP OR NT-proBNP) AND (critical illness)] and [(BNP OR NT-proBNP) AND (intensive care)]. Results: Primary literature used BNP and NT-proBNP for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring. For diagnosis of acute lung injury in unselected intensive care patients and for diagnosis of heart failure in trauma patients, the biomarkers had low sensitivity and are of modest use. BNP and NT-proBNP were found to have a significant ability to prognosticate adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. A single paper examined the use of BNP as a non-invasive replacement for pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, finding little value.

We postulated that a low BNP level would exclude cardiac dysfunction as the principal cause of pulmonary edema and therefore help in the diagnosis of acute lung injury. Design:A retrospective derivation cohort was followed by a prospective validation cohort of consecutive patients with acute pulmonary edema admitted to three intensive care units. BNP was measured within 24 hrs from onset. Critical care experts blinded to BNP results integrated clinical data with the course of disease and response to therapy and served as the reference standard. Setting:Three intensive care units at the tertiary center. Patients:Consecutive critically ill patients with acute pulmonary edema. Interventions:None. Measurements and Main Results:In a derivation cohort of 84 patients, a BNP threshold of \u2264250 pg/mL had a specificity of 87% and sensitivity of 48% for the diagnosis of acute lung injury. High specificity of BNP (90%, likelihood ratio of 3.9) was confirmed in a validation cohort of 120 consecutive patients, 52 (43%) of whom had acute lung injury. Notably, 32% of patients with acute lung injury had concomitant cardiac dysfunction. The median time from the onset of pulmonary edema to BNP testing was 3 hrs. The accuracy of BNP (area under receiver operator curve, 0.71) was comparable with pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (area under receiver operator curve, 0.66) and superior to ejection fraction (area under receiver operator curve, 0.60) in subgroups of patients in whom these tests were performed. The accuracy of BNP improved when patients with renal insufficiency were excluded (area under receiver operator curve, 0.82). Conclusion:When measured early after the onset of acute pulmonary edema, a BNP level of <250 pg/mL supports the diagnosis of acute lung injury. The high rate of cardiac and renal dysfunction in critically ill patients limits the discriminative role of BNP.

The different mechanisms by which reciprocal neuronal activity is generated remain to be established. A common motif in neuronal circuits is the presence of afferents that provide excitation to one set of principal neurons and, via interneurons, inhibition to a second set of principal neurons. This circuitry can be the substrate for generation of reciprocal signals. Here we demonstrate that this equivalent circuit in the cerebellar cortex enables the reciprocal firing rates of Purkinje cells to be efficiently generated from a common set of mossy fiber inputs. The activity of a mossy fiber is relayed to Purkinje cells positioned immediately above it by excitatory granule cells. The firing rates of these Purkinje cells increase as a linear function of mossy fiber, and thus granule cell, activity. In addition to exciting Purkinje cells positioned immediately above it, the activity of a mossy fiber is relayed to laterally positioned Purkinje cells by a disynaptic granule cell \u2192 molecular layer interneuron pathway. Here we show in acutely prepared cerebellar slices that the input-output relationship of these laterally positioned Purkinje cells is linear and reciprocal to the first set. A similar linear input-output relationship between decreases in Purkinje cell firing and strength of stimulation of laterally positioned granule cells was also observed in vivo. Use of interneurons to generate reciprocal firing rates may be a common mechanism by which the brain generates reciprocal signals.", "citedAbstract": "1. Extracellular recordings were obtained from 124 Purkinje cells (P-cells) in the flocculus of alert monkeys. P-cell simple spike-firing rate was analyzed quantitatively during various combinations of smooth-pursuit eye movement and passive head rotation. 2. During sinusoidal smooth eye movements, 80% of the P-cells displayed increased firing rate during ipsilateral and 20% during contralateral eye movement. Over the frequency range 0.3--1.4 Hz, firing-rate modulation was proportional to and in phase with maximum eye velocity. During the steady state of triangle-wave tracking, firing rate increased monotonically as a function of eye velocity. Since firing rate was uncorrelated with retinal-error velocity, one component of P-cell firing rate was related to eye velocity. 3. During the transient phase of triangle-wave tracking, when an instantaneous change in the direction of target movement caused a large retinal-error velocity, 40% of the P-cells were related only to eye velocity. Sixty percent of the P-cells displayed an overshoot or undershoot in firing rate, indicating a relationship to either retinal-error velocity or eye acceleration as well as to eye velocity. 4. During the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR), evoked by head rotation in the dark, P-cell firing rate was only weakly modulated. In contrast, when the monkey suppressed the VOR by fixating a target that rotated with him, P-cell rate was deeply modulated. Since the modulation was proportional to and in phase with maximum head velocity, another component of P-cell firing rate was related to head velocity. 5. Of 36 P-cells tested, 35 displayed firing-rate modulation during both suppression of the VOR and smooth-pursuit eye movement. P-cells that reached peak firing rate during ipsilateral head rotation also reached peak firing rate during ipsilateral smooth eye rotation. Average population sensitivitites to head velocity and eye velocity were equal. In three conditions in which eye and head velocity were elicited simultaneously, P-cell firing rate could be predicted by the linear, vector addition of the separate eye and head velocity components of firing rate. Therefore, the relatively weak modulation of P-cell firing rate during the VOR in the dark can be accounted for by the cancellation of equal but opposite head and eye velocity components. 6. The connections of flocculus P-cells to interneurons in the brain stem VOR pathways have been established in other mammals. In the context of those connections, P-cell firing patterns were appropriate to facilitate the eye movements the monkey was required to make. We conclude that the flocculus is important for sustaining any smooth eye movements that are different from those evoked by head rotation in the dark.

This article aims to study the prevalence of ESBL colonization among paediatric cardiac surgery patients, and to compare occurrence of post-operative infections with and without ESBL colonization. We also aim to study the correlation between the onset of postoperative infection and other parameters such as age, length of stay and preoperative antibiotic therapy.MethodsA retrospective cohort study included paediatric cardiac surgery patients in Cheikh Zaid hospital in Rabat, Morocco, between the 1st of January 2011 and 31 December 2014. A screening for ESBL colonization was requested for children who had a risk factor (previous hospitalization and/or taking antibiotics) at admission. Swabs were collected from three sites (throat, nose and anus). Two groups were compared \u2013 patients colonized and not colonized with ESBLs. Statistical analysis was performed using R software.ResultsESBL colonization screening was performed in 111 patients. Positive colonization was detected in 17 cases (15%). Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP): 9 (53%) was the most frequently isolated species. Among the 17 patients, 23.5% (4/17) developed a postoperative infection due to ESBLs versus only one patient without colonization (1%).There was a statically significant difference in terms of occurrence of postoperative infection between the two groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Relative risk of developing a postoperative infection with positive colonization was 22 (95% CI, 8.37\u201358.5).ConclusionsThe analysis of colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria and the prevention of nosocomial infections appear to be important challenges for paediatric cardiac surgery.

The aim of the study was to present institutional experience with the multidrug resistant microorganism colonization patterns observed in children with congenital heart diseases hospitalized in a hybrid pediatric cardiac surgery center. Material and methods Microbiological samples were routinely collected in all children admitted to our department. All microbiological samples were analyzed with regard to multidrug resistant microorganisms: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Gram-negative rods producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), multidrug resistant Gram-negative rods (MDR-GNRs), carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA). Results In 30 (9%) swabs \u2018alert\u2019 pathogens from the above group of listed microorganisms were found. All positive swabs were isolated in 19 (16.1%) children. Multidrug resistant pathogen colonization was statistically significantly more often observed in children admitted from other medical facilities than in children admitted from home (38% vs. 10%, p = 0.0089). In the group of children younger than 6 months \u2018alert\u2019 pathogen were more often observed than in older children (34.1% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001). Conclusions Preoperative multidrug resistant pathogen screening in children admitted and referred for congenital heart disease procedures may be of great importance since many of these patients are colonized with resistant bacteria.

Especially, a causally ordered delivery consistency is more useful for these applications in which a large number of processes request collaboratively and interactively. In P/S systems of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), data fusion, the process of correlating individual sensor readings into high-level sensing results, depends on a causally ordered delivery. And gossip protocols based on P/S systems are becoming one of the promising solutions for addressing P/S scalability problems and very useful for the applications with a mixture of diverse message order consistencies. In this paper, we present two versions of causally ordered delivery protocols based on P/S systems using gossip protocols. The one is that only the predecessors immediately before the multicast message are disseminated from brokers to subscribers. And the other, specifically for P/S systems of WSNs, is that the timestamps that represent the gossip round in which the immediate predecessors are generated are disseminated from brokers to subscribers.

Modern DRAMs have multiple banks to serve multiple memory requests in parallel. However, when two requests go to the same bank, they have to be served serially, exacerbating the high latency of on-chip memory. Adding more banks to the system to mitigate this problem incurs high system cost. Our goal in this work is to achieve the benefits of increasing the number of banks with a low-cost approach. To this end, we propose three new mechanisms, SALP-1, SALP-2, and MASA (Multitude of Activated Subarrays), to reduce the serialization of different requests that go to the same bank. The key observation exploited by our mechanisms is that a modern DRAM bank is implemented as a collection of subarrays that operate largely independently while sharing few global peripheral structures. \nOur three proposed mechanisms mitigate the negative impact of bank serialization by overlapping different components of the bank access latencies of multiple requests that go to different subarrays within the same bank. SALP-1 requires no changes to the existing DRAM structure, and needs to only reinterpret some of the existing DRAM timing parameters. SALP-2 and MASA require only modest changes (< 0.15% area overhead) to the DRAM peripheral structures, which are much less design constrained than the DRAM core. Our evaluations show that SALP-1, SALP-2 and MASA significantly improve performance for both single-core systems (7%/13%/17%) and multi-core systems (15%/16%/20%), averaged across a wide range of workloads.

Our proposed mechanisms (SALP-1, SALP-2, and MASA) mitigate the negative impact of bank serialization by overlapping different components of the bank access latencies of multiple requests that go to different subarrays within the same bank. SALP-1 requires no changes to the existing DRAM structure and only needs reinterpretation of some DRAM timing parameters. SALP-2 and MASA require only modest changes (<;0.15% area overhead) to the DRAM peripheral structures, which are much less design constrained than the DRAM core. Evaluations show that all our schemes significantly improve performance for both single-core systems and multi-core systems. Our schemes also interact positively with application-aware memory request scheduling in multi-core systems.", "citingTitle": "Exploiting the DRAM Microarchitecture to Increase Memory-Level Parallelism", "citedTitle": "A case for exploiting subarray-level parallelism (SALP) in DRAM"}

Cytoplasmic K+ concentration is mainly regulated by K+ uptake via Na+-K+-ATPase and K+ efflux through K+ channels in the plasma membrane. Carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), a protonophore that dissipates the H+ gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria, induces apoptosis in many cell types. In rat and human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC), FCCP opened the large-conductance, voltage- and Ca2+-sensitive KK+ (maxi-K) channels, increased K+ currents through maxi-K channels [I(K(Ca))], and induced apoptosis. Tetraethylammonia (1 mM) and iberiotoxin (100 nM) decreased I(K(Ca)) by blocking the sarcolemmal maxi-K channels and inhibited the FCCP-induced apoptosis in PASMC cultured in media containing serum and growth factors. Furthermore, inhibition of K+ efflux by raising extracellular K+ concentration from 5 to 40 mM also attenuated PASMC apoptosis induced by FCCP and the K+ ionophore valinomycin. These results suggest that FCCP-mediated apoptosis in PASMC is partially due to an increase of maxi-K channel activity.

Morphological, functional, and evolutionary aspects of the female phenotype are discussed. The flightlessness of female N. lefuarius is linked not only with complex modifications of the skeletomuscular structure, especially elements of the flight apparatus, but also with greatly enlarged ovaries and a reduced gut. Compared with other flightless female lepidopterans, females of N. lefuarius display a specific thoracic skeletomuscular configuration, which strongly suggests independent evolution, in agreement with the phylogenetic pattern. The evolutionary scenario of flight ability enhancement in Lepidoptera is demonstrated using a combined phylogeny from recent studies based on molecular data. Thoracic skeletomuscular characters are compiled and mapped, mainly using extensive information from the literature, but also including the new morphological data obtained from the male N. lefuarius. Important changes in the thoracic character system are linked with the rise of Coelolepida, Heteroneura, and Ditrysia. Only minor changes take place in the character system in more advanced groups of Lepidoptera. A highly unusual feature is the secondarily stiff wing type in some groups of Ditrysia without the neopteran basal folding mechanism. The morphological background of the secondarily evolved \u201cpalaeopteran\u201d condition is a complex of different character changes.

We used seven nuclear gene fragments, elongation factor 1alpha (EF-1alpha), wingless (wgl), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ribosomal protein S5 (RpS5) and segments D1 and D2 of the 28S rRNA gene, and one mitochondrial gene fragment, cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI). Sampling included 55 species of Ennominae covering all tribes with flightless females of the Holarctic boreal zone, and some other geometrids used as outgroups. Our results clearly confirmed that Ennominae (including Alsophila of the traditional subfamily Alsophilinae) is a monophyletic group, as well as supported the previously established morphology-based division of Ennominae into \"ennomine\" and \"boarmiine\" groups of genera. A number of taxonomic ambiguities were resolved but the monophyly of the traditionally recognised tribe Bistonini, comprising a number of flightless species, remained ambiguous. Bistonini is thus suggested to be subsumed to the tribe Boarmiini in the broad sense. Indeed, an analysis of timing of divergence suggested that Boarmiini s. lat. rapidly diversified in the late Oligocene/early Miocene. Within the Ennominae, seven independent origins of female flightlessness were revealed facilitating phylogenetic comparative analyses to be performed in search of causes and consequences of this phenomenon. The present phylogenetic hypothesis supports the conclusions of the \"adaptive story\", a hypothesis of the sequence of evolutionary events leading to flightlessness, we have presented earlier (Sn\u00e4ll et al., 2007). In particular, in the \"boarmiine\" group, the tribe Boarmiini s. lat. clearly represents a group of geometrids in which female flightlessness has evolved more frequently than in any other tribes, suggesting that this clade has likely been predisposed to evolutionary events leading to the manifestation of female flightlessness.

The Drosophila embryo undergoes several cycles of rapid furrow ingression during early development that culminate in the formation of an epithelial sheet. Previous studies have demonstrated the requirement for intracellular trafficking pathways in furrow ingression; however, the pathways that link compartmental behaviors with cortical furrow ingression events are unclear. Here, we show that Rab8 has striking dynamic behaviors in vivo. As furrows ingress, cytoplasmic Rab8 puncta are depleted and Rab8 accumulates at the plasma membrane in a location that coincides with known regions of directed membrane addition. We additionally use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to N-terminally tag Rab8, which is then used to address endogenous localization and function. Endogenous Rab8 displays partial coincidence with Rab11 and the Golgi, and this colocalization is enriched during the fast phase of cellularization. When Rab8 function is disrupted, furrow formation in the early embryo is completely abolished. We also demonstrate that Rab8 behaviors require the function of the exocyst complex subunit Sec5 as well as the recycling endosome protein Rab11. Active, GTP-locked Rab8 is primarily associated with dynamic membrane compartments and the plasma membrane, whereas GDP-locked Rab8 forms large cytoplasmic aggregates. These studies suggest a model in which active Rab8 populations direct furrow ingression by guiding the targeted delivery of cytoplasmic membrane stores to the cell surface through interactions with the exocyst tethering complex. Summary: During Drosophila cellularization, the GTPase Rab8 guides the targeting of cytoplasmic membrane stores to the cell surface through interactions with the exocyst complex.", "citedAbstract": "Cellularization of the Drosophila embryo is a specialized form of cytokinesis that results in the formation of a polarized epithelium. The mechanisms of membrane growth during cytokinesis are largely unknown. It is also unclear whether membrane growth and polarization represent distinct processes that occur simultaneously or whether growth of the membrane is involved in the emergence of polarity. Using a combination of surface labeling and particles tracking techniques, we monitored the dynamics of marked membrane regions during cellularization. We find that the major source of membrane is intracellular, rather than in the form of a plasma membrane reservoir. Depolymerization of microtubules inhibits the export of a newly synthesized transmembrane protein from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane and simultaneously blocks membrane growth. Membrane insertion occurs in a defined sequence at specific sites, first apical, then apical\u2013lateral. Diffusion of the membrane appears insufficient to compete with the massive local insertion of new membrane. We thus identify a tightly regulated scheme of polarized membrane insertion during cellularization. We propose that such a mechanism could participate in the progressive emergence of apical\u2013basal polarity.", "citingTitle": "Rab8 directs furrow ingression and membrane addition during epithelial formation in Drosophila melanogaster", "citedTitle": "Polarized Insertion of New Membrane from a Cytoplasmic Reservoir during Cleavage of the Drosophila Embryo"}

Methods: This is a narrative review of evidence identified searching MEDLINE with the strategy [(BNP OR NT-proBNP) AND (critical illness AND intensive care)]. Seven primary reports and two narrative reviews were retrieved. For completeness, literature from each of the following searches was reviewed: [(BNP OR NT-proBNP) AND (critical illness)] and [(BNP OR NT-proBNP) AND (intensive care)]. Results: Primary literature used BNP and NT-proBNP for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring. For diagnosis of acute lung injury in unselected intensive care patients and for diagnosis of heart failure in trauma patients, the biomarkers had low sensitivity and are of modest use. BNP and NT-proBNP were found to have a significant ability to prognosticate adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. A single paper examined the use of BNP as a non-invasive replacement for pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, finding little value. The impact of renal insufficiency on the markers was noted as a confounder in most studies. In the secondary searches, some preliminary data suggested a possible role for the natriuretic peptides in exclusion of a cardiac cause for certain conditions among intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, the general findings were that the performance of BNP and NT-proBNP is unimpressive among ICU patients.

We postulated that a low BNP level would exclude cardiac dysfunction as the principal cause of pulmonary edema and therefore help in the diagnosis of acute lung injury. Design:A retrospective derivation cohort was followed by a prospective validation cohort of consecutive patients with acute pulmonary edema admitted to three intensive care units. BNP was measured within 24 hrs from onset. Critical care experts blinded to BNP results integrated clinical data with the course of disease and response to therapy and served as the reference standard. Setting:Three intensive care units at the tertiary center. Patients:Consecutive critically ill patients with acute pulmonary edema. Interventions:None. Measurements and Main Results:In a derivation cohort of 84 patients, a BNP threshold of \u2264250 pg/mL had a specificity of 87% and sensitivity of 48% for the diagnosis of acute lung injury. High specificity of BNP (90%, likelihood ratio of 3.9) was confirmed in a validation cohort of 120 consecutive patients, 52 (43%) of whom had acute lung injury. Notably, 32% of patients with acute lung injury had concomitant cardiac dysfunction. The median time from the onset of pulmonary edema to BNP testing was 3 hrs. The accuracy of BNP (area under receiver operator curve, 0.71) was comparable with pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (area under receiver operator curve, 0.66) and superior to ejection fraction (area under receiver operator curve, 0.60) in subgroups of patients in whom these tests were performed. The accuracy of BNP improved when patients with renal insufficiency were excluded (area under receiver operator curve, 0.82). Conclusion:When measured early after the onset of acute pulmonary edema, a BNP level of <250 pg/mL supports the diagnosis of acute lung injury. The high rate of cardiac and renal dysfunction in critically ill patients limits the discriminative role of BNP.

Parasite infection was detected by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction. Antibodies to the sporozoite CSP repeats of Plasmodium vivax, P. falciparum, and P. malariae (PvCS, PfCS, and PmCS) were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 and DQB1 genes were typed using Luminex\u00ae xMAP\u00ae technology.ResultsThe prevalence of immunoglobulin G against P. vivax CSP peptide (62%) was higher than P. falciparum (49%) and P. malariae (46%) CSP peptide. Most of the studied individuals had antibodies to at least one of the three peptides (72%), 34% had antibodies to all three peptides and 28% were non-responders. Although the majority of the population was not infected at the time of the survey, 74.3% of parasite-negative individuals had antibodies to at least one of the CSPs. Importantly, among individuals carrying the haplotypes DRB1*04~DQB1*03, there was a significantly higher frequency of PfCS responders, and DRB1*16~DQB1*03 haplotype for PvCS and PfCS responders. In contrast, HLA-DRB1*01 and HLA-DQB1*05 allelic groups were associated with a lack of antibodies to P. vivax and P. falciparum CSP repeats, and the haplotype DRB1*01~DQB1*05 was also associated with non-responders, including non-responders to P. malariae.ConclusionsOur results show that in low transmission settings, naturally acquired antibody responses against the CSP repeats of P. vivax, P. falciparum, and P. malariae in a single cross-sectional study may not represent a valuable marker for monitoring recent malaria exposure, especially in an area with a high prevalence of P. vivax.

Intestinal UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) have been proposed to provide intrinsic resistance against MMF-induced gastrointestinal toxicity by converting MPA to the inactive MPA 7-O-glucuronide. Using an optimized intestinal microsome preparation method that stabilized the intestinal MPA UGT activity, the MPA UGT activity of male Sprague-Dawley rat intestinal microsomes was characterized. A longitudinal gradient similar to that described for other phenolic compounds was observed, with the activity decreasing from the duodenum to the distal small intestine and colon. The catalytic efficiency of MPA glucuronidation decreased from the proximal to distal intestine as a result of decreasing Vmax and increasing Km. The finding that homozygous Gunn rats lack detectable intestinal MPA UGT activity indicates exclusive roles of UGT1A1, UGT1A6, and/or UGT1A7. Quantitative immunoblotting revealed a parallel between the MPA UGT activity and the content of UGT1A7-like immunoreactivity (18.7 and 7.3 \u03bcg/mg for duodenum and colon, respectively).

The response rate near a memorized duration has a Gaussian shape centered on the to-be-timed interval (criterion time). The width of the Gaussian-like distribution of responses increases linearly with the criterion time, i.e., interval timing obeys the scalar property.ResultsWe presented analytical and numerical results based on the striatal beat frequency (SBF) model showing that parameter variability (noise) mimics behavioral data. A key functional block of the SBF model is the set of oscillators that provide the time base for the entire timing network. The implementation of the oscillators block as simplified phase (cosine) oscillators has the additional advantage that is analytically tractable. We also checked numerically that the scalar property emerges in the presence of memory variability by using biophysically realistic Morris-Lecar oscillators. First, we predicted analytically and tested numerically that in a noise-free SBF model the output function could be approximated by a Gaussian. However, in a noise-free SBF model the width of the Gaussian envelope is independent of the criterion time, which violates the scalar property. We showed analytically and verified numerically that small fluctuations of the memorized criterion time leads to scalar property of interval timing.ConclusionsNoise is ubiquitous in the form of small fluctuations of intrinsic frequencies of the neural oscillators, the errors in recording/retrieving stored information related to criterion time, fluctuation in neurotransmitters\u2019 concentration, etc. Our model suggests that the biological noise plays an essential functional role in the SBF interval timing.", "citedAbstract": "Humans and other animals demonstrate the ability to perceive and respond to temporally relevant information with characteristic behavioral properties. For example, the response time distributions in peak-interval timing tasks are well described by Gaussian functions, and superimpose when scaled by the criterion duration. This superimposition has been referred to as the scalar property and results from the fact that the standard deviation of a temporal estimate is proportional to the duration being timed. Various psychological models have been proposed to account for such responding. These models vary in their success in predicting the temporal control of behavior as well as in the neurobiological feasibility of the mechanisms they postulate. A review of the major interval timing models reveals that no current model is successful on both counts. The neurobiological properties of the basal ganglia, an area known to be necessary for interval timing and motor control, suggests that this set of structures act as a coincidence detector of cortical and thalamic input. The hypothesized functioning of the basal ganglia is similar to the mechanisms proposed in the beat frequency timing model [R.C. Miall, Neural Computation 1 (1989) 359-371], leading to a reevaluation of its capabilities in terms of behavioral prediction. By implementing a probabilistic firing rule, a dynamic response threshold, and adding variance to a number of its components, simulations of the striatal beat frequency model were able to produce output that is functionally equivalent to the expected behavioral response form of peak-interval timing procedures.", "citingTitle": "Why noise is useful in functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing?", "citedTitle": "Cortico-striatal circuits and interval timing: coincidence detection of oscillatory processes."}

Women who reported vigorous exercise both in high school (<= 5 hr per week) and adulthood (<= 2 hr per week) had the lowest odds of depressive symptoms (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.71\u22120.82) relative to never active women; the OR was 0.90 for women who were active in high school but not adulthood (95% CI = 0.85-0.96) and 0.83 for women who were inactive in high school but became active in adulthood (95% CI = 0.77-0.91). Although walking for exercise was not associated with risk of depressive symptoms overall, there was evidence of a weak inverse relation among obese women (Body Mass Index <= 30).Conclusions: Leisure time vigorous physical activity was associated with a reduced odds of depressive symptoms in U.S. Black women.", "citingTitle": "Relation between clinical depression risk and physical activity and time spent watching television in older women: a 10-year prospective follow-up study.", "citedTitle": "Leisure time physical activity in relation to depressive symptoms in the black women\u2019s health study"}

Recent experimental studies suggest that this neuroanatomical system is also critically involved in motor learning. In the present study, motor learning/transfer capabilities were compared between patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease and a group of normal elderly people. Subjects practiced a bimanual coordination task that required continuous flexion-extension movements in the transverse plane with a 90\u00b0 phase offset between the forearms. During acquisition, augmented visual feedback of the relative motions was provided in real time. The findings revealed improvements in the bimanual coordination pattern across practice in both groups when the augmented concurrent feedback was present. However, when transferred to performance conditions in which the augmented information was withheld, performance deteriorated (relative to the augmented condition) and this effect was more prevalent in the Parkinson patients. More specifically, no improvement in interlimb coordination was observed under nonaugmented feedback conditions across practice. Instead, a drift toward the preferred in-phase and anti-phase coordination patterns was evident. The present findings suggest that Parkinson patients can improve their performance on a new motor task, but they remain strongly dependent on augmented visual information to guide these newly acquired movements. The apparent adoption of a closed-loop control mode is accompanied with decreases in movement speed in order to use the feedback to ensure accuracy. When the augmented feedback is withheld and the movement pattern is to be controlled by means of intrinsic information feedback sources, performance is severely hampered. The findings are hypothesized to indicate that learning/transfer is affected in Parkinson patients who apparently prefer some constancy in the environmental contingencies under which practice takes place. The present findings are consistent with the notion that the basal ganglia form a critical neuroanatomical substrate for motor learning.", "citedAbstract": "Normal voluntary movements are considered to be of two kinds, or to involve two components, (i) a ballistic or \"open-loop\" type, which are preprogrammed and executed without reference to current sensory information and (ii) a corrective or \"closed-loop\" type, whose course or termination are regulated by such information. In a previous paper it was suggested that Parkinsonism disrupted the first kind of movement, but intention tremor did not. In the present paper three experiments designed to test this hypothesis are described. Subjects were tested on an acquisition-tracking task using an oscilloscope display and joystick control, and measurements were made of the duration, velocity and error of their initial movements to acquire the target. Parkinsonian movements were found to be considerably different from normal in that (a) most movements by this group lasted longer than the reaction time for their initiation, as if including some secondary correction in their execution, (b) the rate of movement was not varied for different amplitudes (so keeping the duration fairly constant) as in normal subjects, but rather movements of all amplitudes were made at a constant slow rate, so that duration increased markedly with the larger steps, (c) error increased disproportionately as the velocity of movement increased; in particular any movements completed in one reaction time or less tended to be wildly inaccurate, (d) removing either the target or the response marker from the screen at the beginning of a movement had a significant effect, making it shorter in duration and smaller in amplitude than those usually produced with both markers visible all the time. Parkinsonian subjects showed no improvement in performance with repeated attempts at one movement over a whole sequence, so their deficit appears to be stable even after practice on a known fixed task. These results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that Parkinsonism interferes with the generation of accurate ballistic action which are characteristic of normal skilled movement. Tremor subjects in general resembled normal control subjects in their initial acquistion movements, but their accuracy was less with the larger steps.", "citingTitle": "Interlimb coordination in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease: motor learning deficits and the importance of augmented information feedback", "citedTitle": "Visual \"closed-loop\" and \"open-loop\" characteristics of voluntary movement in patients with Parkinsonism and intention tremor."}

We further show that these enhanced T cell responses result in increased protection to malaria in immunized mice challenged with live P. yoelii sporozoites, revealing an adjuvant activity for DC-CK1.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were independently applied, and matching was performed in a blinded fashion. The primary outcome measure was the relative change between preoperative and 2-year postoperative SF-36 questionnaires. Data were analyzed with the t test and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe three groups (FLSS/H-OA/K-OA) were equally matched with respect to mean age (64/63/65 years), sex (female/male, 51/39 for all groups), body mass index (BMI) (27/24/27), and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status (2/2/2). Comparison of preoperative SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) scores and mental component summary (MCS) scores between groups showed no statistical difference (PCS: FLSS=32.0, H-OA=30.2, K-OA=31.3 [p=.32, ANOVA]/MCS: FLSS=43.5, H-OA=45.0, K-OA=46.2 [p=.25, ANOVA]). Postoperatively, PCS improved significantly for all groups (1 year-PCS: FLSS=39.6, H-OA=44.5, K-OA=38.5 [p<.0001 for all groups]; 2 years-PCS: FLSS=38.6, H-OA=43.2, K-OA=37.1 [p<.0001 for all groups]). At both 1- and 2-year follow-ups, the PCS improvement between groups was greater for the H-OA group compared with the FLSS (p=.0037, p=.0073) and K-OA (p=.00016, p=.00053) groups. At the 1-year follow-up, MCS did not significantly increase for any group; however, 2 years postoperatively, MCS improved significantly for the FLSS and H-OA groups (2 years-MCS: FLSS=50.3, H-OA=50.9, K-OA=44.8 [p=.00021, p=.00079, p=.35]).

Methods and Findings NSCs were isolated from normal pregnancy and streptozotocin induced-diabetic pregnancy and cultured in physiological glucose. In order to examine hyperglycemia induced epigenetic changes in NSCs, chromatin reorganization, global histone status at lysine 9 residue of histone H3 (acetylation and trimethylation) and global DNA methylation were examined and found to be altered by hyperglycemia. In NSCs, hyperglycemia increased the expression of Dcx (Doublecortin) and Pafah1b1 (Platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase, isoform 1b, subunit 1) proteins concomitant with decreased expression of four microRNAs (mmu-miR-200a, mmu-miR-200b, mmu-miR-466a-3p and mmu-miR-466 d-3p) predicted to target these genes. Knockdown of specific microRNAs in NSCs resulted in increased expression of Dcx and Pafah1b1 proteins confirming target prediction and altered NSC fate by increasing the expression of neuronal and glial lineage markers.

Dilatation of cerebral arterioles in response to nitroglycerin and vasoconstriction in response to the thromboxane analogue (U-46619) were similar in non-ethanol-fed and ethanol-fed rats. Thus these findings suggest that chronic ethanol exposure impairs responses of cerebral arterioles to agonists, which produce dilatation via the release of an endothelium-derived relaxing factor. We speculate that impaired vasodilatation coupled with preservation of vasoconstriction in ethanol-fed rats may have important implications for the pathogenesis of stroke during chronic alcohol ingestion.", "citingTitle": "Temporal effect of alcohol consumption on reactivity of pial arterioles: role of oxygen radicals.", "citedTitle": "Responses of cerebral arterioles during chronic ethanol exposure."}

Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a method to capture knee-straining postures for entire work shifts by combining measurement techniques with the information obtained from diaries, and thus avoiding measuring entire work shifts. This approach was applied to various occupational tasks to obtain an overview of typical exposure values in current specific occupations.MethodsThe analyses were carried out in the field using an ambulatory measuring system (CUELA) to assess posture combined with one-day self-reported occupational diaries describing the durations of various work tasks. In total, 242 work shifts were measured, representing 81 typical tasks from 16 professions. Knee-straining postures were analysed as daily time intervals for five different postures. The accuracy of the method was examined by comparing the results to measurements of entire work shifts.ResultsUnsupported kneeling was the most widely used knee posture in our sample (median 11.4\u00a0% per work shift), followed by supported kneeling (3.0\u00a0%), sitting on heels (1.1\u00a0%), squatting (0.7\u00a0%), and crawling (0.0\u00a0%). The daily time spent in knee-straining postures varied considerably, both between the individual occupations, within an occupation (e.g. parquet layers: 0.0\u201388.9\u00a0%), and to some extent even within a single task (e.g. preparation work of floor layers (22.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.0\u00a0%). The applied measuring method for obtaining daily exposure to the knee has been proven valid and efficient randomly compared with whole-shift measurements (p\u00a0=\u00a00.27).ConclusionsThe daily degree of postural exposure to the knee showed a huge variation within the analysed job categories and seemed to be dependent on the particular tasks performed.

The men had considerably higher exposure to lifting at work, and also to jumps and vibration, than the women. Among the men there was an association between lifting at work [odds ratio (OR) 3.0, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.6-5.5], squatting or knee bending (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.7-4.9), kneeling (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.3), and jumping (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7-4.1) with knee OA.

In this study, we investigated the effect of verapamil, an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blocker, on oxidative stress response in this fungus. The addition of verapamil resulted in increased sensitivity to the oxidative agent H2O2, which is associated with a decrease of calcium fluctuation under the stress. Moreover, this agent caused enhanced oxidative stress, with increased levels of ROS and enhanced dysfunction of the mitochondria under the oxidative stress. Further investigations in SOD activity, GSH contents and expression of oxidative stress response-related genes indicated that the effect of verapamil is related to the repression of oxidative stress response.

Here, we show that thioredoxin (Trx1), in addition to its antioxidant activity, plays a central role in coordinating the response of C. albicans to ROS by regulating multiple pathways. In particular, Trx1 function is important for H2O2-induced phosphorylation of the Hog1 stress-activated protein kinase and to reverse H2O2-induced oxidation and activation of the AP-1 like transcription factor Cap1. Furthermore, Trx1 regulates H2O2-induced hyperpolarized bud growth in a mechanism that involves activation of the Rad53 checkpoint kinase. Consistent with its key roles in responses to ROS, cells lacking Trx1 displayed significantly attenuated virulence in a murine model of C. albicans systemic infection.

From tandem duplication of a single globin locus, the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin clusters expanded, and then were separated onto different chromosomes. The previous finding of a fossil \u03b2-globin gene (\u03c9) in the marsupial \u03b1-cluster, however, suggested that duplication of the \u03b1-\u03b2 cluster onto two chromosomes, followed by lineage-specific gene loss and duplication, produced paralogous \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin clusters in birds and mammals. Here we analyse genomic data from an egg-laying monotreme mammal, the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), to explore haemoglobin evolution at the stem of the mammalian radiation.ResultsThe platypus \u03b1-globin cluster (chromosome 21) contains embryonic and adult \u03b1- globin genes, a \u03b2-like \u03c9-globin gene, and the GBY globin gene with homology to cytoglobin, arranged as 5'-\u03b6-\u03b6'-\u03b1D-\u03b13-\u03b12-\u03b11-\u03c9-GBY-3'. The platypus \u03b2-globin cluster (chromosome 2) contains single embryonic and adult globin genes arranged as 5'-\u03b5-\u03b2-3'. Surprisingly, all of these globin genes were expressed in some adult tissues. Comparison of flanking sequences revealed that all jawed vertebrate \u03b1-globin clusters are flanked by MPG-C16orf35 and LUC7L, whereas all bird and mammal \u03b2-globin clusters are embedded in olfactory genes. Thus, the mammalian \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin clusters are orthologous to the bird \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin clusters respectively.ConclusionWe propose that \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin clusters evolved from an ancient MPG-C16orf35-\u03b1-\u03b2-GBY-LUC7L arrangement 410 million years ago. A copy of the original \u03b2 (represented by \u03c9 in marsupials and monotremes) was inserted into an array of olfactory genes before the amniote radiation (>315 million years ago), then duplicated and diverged to form orthologous clusters of \u03b2-globin genes with different expression profiles in different lineages.", "citedAbstract": "We have explored the evolution of the alpha-globin gene family by comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses of mammalian alpha-globin genes.

Evolutionary analyses suggest that the gene has generally evolved under purifying selection, indicative of a functional gene.

Between 1975 and 1991, a consecutive series of 129 patients 9\u201318 years of age (average age, 16.2 years) underwent surgery for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. Low back pain associated with leg pain was the main clinical symptom in 106 subjects (82%), back pain in 17 (13%), and leg pain in 6 (5%). Results. Short-term results were excellent or good for 123 cases (95%), with complete pain relief in 97 (75%) and moderate but incomplete relief in 26 (20%). A total of 98 (76%) long-term responses obtained at a mean follow-up of 12.4 years revealed excellent outcomes in 40% of the cases, good in 47%, and poor in 13%. Ten patients (10%) underwent reintervention after 9 years on average (2 fusions and 8 re-explorations for herniated disc). Conclusions. Results have confirmed a tendency for outcomes to deteriorate between the short-term and long-term follow-up in young patients treated by discectomy: this tendency and the rate of reintervention (10%) confirmed the need for long-term follow-up of children and adolescents treated for disc herniation.", "citingTitle": "Intervertebral disc herniation in adolescents.", "citedTitle": "Lumbar Disc Excision in Children and Adolescents"}

Ang II modulated the activity of the Na+/K+ATPase in a dose- and time-dependent manner and was mitogenic, with a dose-dependent (1-1000 nM) proliferative effect and a maximal response at 100 nM. Both Na+/K+ATPase activation and stimulation of proliferation were mediated by binding of Ang II to AT1, as the effects were completely blocked by DuP 753, a specific AT1 antagonist. CGP 42112, an AT2 antagonist, did not affect Ang II actions.

The present study was designed to investigate the regulation by a D2-like dopamine receptor of Ang II-mediated stimulation of Na,K-ATPase activity in the renal proximal tubules. Ang II (10(-13) to 10(-9) mol/L) stimulated Na,K-ATPase activity in the proximal tubules that was completely abolished when the tubules were pretreated with the D2-like receptor agonist bromocriptine (1 micromol/L) for 30 minutes. The effect of bromocriptine on Ang II response was prevented by domperidone (1 micromol/L), a D2-like dopamine receptor antagonist. Similarly, the inhibition of forskolin (1 micromol/L)-induced cAMP accumulation caused by Ang II (10 pmol/L) was also abolished in bromocriptine-pretreated tubules. Basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP was not significantly different in bromocriptine-treated tubules compared with the control. [3H]-Ang II binding sites (angiotensin type 1 [AT1] receptors) were reduced by approximately 65% in bromocriptine-treated proximal tubules, a result that was further substantiated by Western blot analysis revealing a 50% decrease in AT1 receptors in bromocriptine-treated tubules compared with the control. Western blot analysis of G proteins revealed a 2-fold increase in Gsalpha and a 20% decrease in Gialpha1 and Gialpha2 in the bromocriptine-treated proximal tubules. Bromocriptine (1 micromol/L) alone stimulated Na,K-ATPase activity during the first 30 minutes of incubation, and thereafter the stimulation fell to the basal level. Similarly, bromocriptine-mediated inhibition of cAMP lasted only up to 20 minutes. The data suggest that preactivation of D2-like dopamine receptors abolishes Ang II-mediated stimulation of Na,K-ATPase activity and inhibition of cAMP accumulation. This phenomenon may be a consequence of a decrease in AT1 receptors and alterations in G protein levels in the proximal tubules. We propose that such a regulation of Ang II response by bromocriptine is the result of heterologous desensitization of the D2-like receptor system.", "citingTitle": "Angiotensin II stimulation of Na+/K+ATPase activity and cell growth by calcium-independent pathway in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.", "citedTitle": "Bromocriptine regulates angiotensin II response on sodium pump in proximal tubules."}

These findings broaden our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying perspective taking, and suggest that impairments in perspective taking in AD occur during utterance planning, and at a relatively early processing stage which involves rapid visual scanning and problem solving, rather than during retrieval of lexical items needed to speak.

We focus on Least Squares Support Vector Machines which are reformulations to standard SVMs that lead to solving linear KKT systems. Least squares support vector machines are closely related to regularization networks and Gaussian processes but additionally emphasize and exploit primaldual interpretations from optimization theory. In view of interior point algorithms such LS-SVM KKT systems can be considered as a core problem. Where needed the obtained solutions can be robustified and/or sparsified. As an alternative to a top-down choice of the cost function, methods from robust statistics are employed in a bottom-up fashion for further improving the estimates. We explain the natural links between LS-SVM classifiers and kernel Fisher discriminant analysis. The framework is further extended towards unsupervised learning by considering PCA analysis and its kernel version as a one-class modelling problem. This leads to new primal-dual support vector machine formulations for kernel PCA and kernel canonical correlation analysis. Furthermore, LS-SVM formulations are mentioned towards recurrent networks and control, thereby extending the methods from static to dynamic problems. In general, support vector machines may pose heavy computational challenges for large data sets. For this purpose, we propose a method of Fixed Size LS-SVM where the estimation is done in the primal space in relation to a Nystr\u00f6m sampling with active selection of support vectors and we discuss extensions to committee networks.

However, typical P300 measurements require relatively lengthy recording sessions. It would therefore be desirable to minimize the required time and to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio by finding the optimal balance between parameters such as stimulus probability and the number of target trials or the recording time. This is different from previous studies, which assessed the amplitude only. We recorded event-related potentials to visual stimuli using standard oddball paradigms with various target frequencies ranging from 2:1 (target majority) to 1:16 (massive non-target majority). We compared the signal-to-noise ratios for a fixed number of target trials as well as for a fixed total recording time and assessed effects of the immediate stimulus history. As expected, P300 amplitudes depend strongly on target infrequency. This did not reach saturation within the range tested. For a given number of target trials, the signal-to-noise ratio also increases with target infrequency. For a given recording duration, the signal-to-noise ratio is optimal around 1:8.

The valve tends to block the bypass passage under steady state conditions. When a surge in hydraulic pressure occurs, as would occur in response to operator input or at startup, the hydraulic fluid overcomes the bias of the spring and urges the valve tip away from the otherwise blocked orifice which links the bypass passage to the chamber. Opening the orifice tends to diminish the magnitude of the pressure peak and helps eliminate jerky starts of the mower. The spring eventually overcomes the reduced hydraulic fluid pressure and returns the head of the valve tip into a sealed relationship with the bypass passage orifice. A shoulder nut permits the valve to be secured at a fixed position within the chamber. Varying the position of the valve within the chamber permits adjustment of the absolute value of the peak pressure which will be reached within the bypass passage.

The model is able to reproduce the most dominant changes in the EEG and suggests that they are caused by the amplification of resonances within the thalamo-cortical system. Specifically, while observed increases in delta and alpha power are reflections of amplified resonances in the respective frequency bands, increases in theta power are caused indirectly by spectral power leakage from delta and alpha bands. The model suggests that these changes are brought about through increased inhibition within local cortical interneuron circuits. These results are encouraging and motivate more extensive use of neural meanfield models in elucidating the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of pharmacological agents on macroscopic brain dynamics.", "citedAbstract": "The neuronal mechanisms of general anesthesia are still poorly understood. Besides several characteristic features of anesthesia observed in experiments, a prominent effect is the bi-phasic change of power in the observed electroencephalogram (EEG), i.e. the initial increase and subsequent decrease of the EEG-power in several frequency bands while increasing the concentration of the anaesthetic agent. The present work aims to derive analytical conditions for this bi-phasic spectral behavior by the study of a neural population model. This model describes mathematically the effective membrane potential and involves excitatory and inhibitory synapses, excitatory and inhibitory cells, nonlocal spatial interactions and a finite axonal conduction speed. The work derives conditions for synaptic time constants based on experimental results and gives conditions on the resting state stability. Further the power spectrum of Local Field Potentials and EEG generated by the neural activity is derived analytically and allow for the detailed study of bi-spectral power changes.

Patients with cardiovascular disease have been identified as the largest group which need to be protected from effects of urban air pollution. Methods We sought to estimate associations between indicators of urban air pollution and daily mortality using time series of daily TSP, PM 10 , PM 2.5 , NO 2 , SO 2 , O 3 and nontrauma deaths in Vienna (Austria) 2000\u20132004. We used polynomial distributed lag analysis adjusted for seasonality, daily temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and incidence of influenza as registered by sentinels. Results All three particulate measures and NO 2 were associated with mortality from all causes and from ischemic heart disease and COPD at all ages and in the elderly. The magnitude of the effect was largest for PM 2.5 and NO 2 . Best predictor of mortality increase lagged 0\u20137 days was PM 2.5 (for ischemic heart disease and COPD) and NO 2 (for other heart disease and all causes). Total mortality increase, lagged 0\u201314 days, per 10\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0m \u22123 was 2.6% for PM 2.5 and 2.9% for NO 2 , mainly due to cardiopulmonary and cerebrovascular causes. Conclusion Acute and subacute lethal effects of urban air pollution are predicted by PM 2.5 and NO 2 increase even at relatively low levels of these pollutants. This is consistent with results on hospital admissions and the lack of a threshold. While harvesting (reduction of mortality after short increase due to premature deaths of most sensitive persons) seems to be of minor importance, deaths accumulate during 14 days after an increase of air pollutants. The limit values for PM 2.5 and NO 2 proposed for 2010 in the European Union are unable to prevent serious health effects.", "citedAbstract": "Air pollution consists of both gaseous and particulate-matter pollutants.

The latter consist of particulate matter of varying aerodynamic diameter, as defined by cutoff points\u2014for example, particles with diameters of ,10 mm (PM10) or ,2.5 mm (PM2.5). Because of their small size, these particles can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and deposited in the alveoli. Why should cardiologists care about ambient air? It has long been known that air pollution can adversely affect human health. Extreme levels of pollution may cause markedly increased mortality rates; in this regard one often refers to the Meuse valley fog of 1930 or the London smog of 1952. These episodes initiated successful efforts and legislation to reduce air pollution. Nevertheless, even at current ambient pollution levels, the relation between pollution and excess morbidity and mortality still exists. However, the nature of the pollutants and the type of health effects have shifted, with a special emphasis now being placed on the heart rather than the lungs.

Specifically, we utilized wavelet transform and stage segmentation algorithms using VTC time series data set as an input. The VTC time series was time-locked with multichannel (n\u00a0=\u00a064) EEG signals to examine its underlying neural substrates. To identify the focal sources of neural substrates of VTC, a two-step approach was designed combining the independent component analysis (ICA) and low-resolution tomography (LORETA) of multichannel EEG. There were two major findings: (1) a significant increase of VTC minimal values (along with enhanced variability of VTC) was observed during the transition-to-instability stage with progression to ultimate loss of balance and falling; and (2) this VTC dynamics was associated with pronounced modulation of EEG predominantly within theta, alpha and gamma frequency bands. The sources of this EEG modulation were identified at the cingulate cortex (ACC) and the junction of precuneus and parietal lobe, as well as at the occipital cortex.

Only those athletes playing in competitive sports at regional or national levels were included in the study. Fifty-seven athletes (95%) were available for a follow-up. There were 28 athletes in the OAT group and 29 athletes in the MF group. The mean duration of symptoms was 21.32 +/- 5.57 months and the mean follow-up was 37.1 months (range, 36 to 38 months), and none of the athletes had prior surgical interventions to the affected knee. Patients were evaluated using modified Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) and International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scores, radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and clinical assessment. An independent observer performed a follow-up examination after 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. At 12.4 months postoperatively, arthroscopy with biopsy for histologic evaluation was carried out. A radiologist and a pathologist, both of whom were blinded to each patient's treatment, did the radiologic and histologic evaluations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter 37.1 months, both groups had significant clinical improvement (P < .05). According to the modified HSS and ICRS scores, functional and objective assessment showed that 96% had excellent or good results after OAT compared with 52% for the MF procedure (P < .001). At 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery, the HSS and ICRS showed statistically significantly better results in the OAT group (P = .03; P = .006; P = .006). Younger athletes did better in both groups. No serious complications were reported. There was 1 failure in the OAT group and 9 in the MF group. The ICRS Cartilage Repair Assessment for macroscopic evaluation during arthroscopy at 12.4 months showed excellent or good repairs in 84% after OAT and in 57% after MF. Biopsy specimens were obtained from 58% of the patients and histologic evaluation of repair showed better scores (according to ICRS) for the OAT group (P < .05). MRI evaluation showed excellent or good repairs in 94% after OAT compared with 49% after MF. Twenty-six (93%) OAT patients and 15 (52%) MF patients returned to sports activities at the preinjury level at an average of 6.5 months (range, 4 to 8 months). Others showed a decline in sports activity level.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAt an average of 37.1 months (range, 36 to 38 months) follow-up, our prospective, randomized, clinical study in young active athletes under the age of 40 has shown significant superiority of OAT over MF for the repair of articular cartilage defects in the knee. We found that only 52% of MF athletes could return to sports at the preinjury level. Limitations of our study included a small number of athletes and a relatively short (3-year) follow-up.

Our second purpose was to assess biases in joint position sense at various joint angles in a sagittal workspace. We hypothesized that akin to previous single-joint investigations, the shoulder and elbow would demonstrate better joint position sense as joint angles approached 90\u00b0 during our multi-joint task. Sixteen healthy and right-hand-dominant subjects participated in the present investigation.

We did not find evidence of a substantial difference in joint position sense between instructions to memorize the hand position or joint angle. This finding, when considered in conjunction with other evidence, suggests that studies employing either a joint angle protocol or a hand estimation protocol likely produce results that are similar enough to be compared.

Older sedentary adults showed greater errors and performed movements less smoothly than older active adults.

We quantified consumption of insect resources and behavioural interactions in dyads and triads composed of different combinations of sexes and species. Geckos consumed fewer insects when in pairs than when they were alone, indicating general evidence of resource competition. However, resource consumption of parthenogenetic H. garnotii was not negatively affected by the presence of invasive H. frenatus, suggesting that resource competition is not the primary mechanism of displacement. Males were aggressive towards conspecific males, but showed little aggression towards conspecific females and parthenogenetic females; females and parthenogens displayed little aggression. Male H. frenatus courted and copulated with both conspecific and heterospecific females in dyads and in triads and, by some measures, showed a preference for larger H. garnotii females. When paired with females or parthenogens, males consumed fewer resources because they turned their attention to courtship. Evidence of interspecific courtship suggests that sexual interference may be a more likely mechanism of displacement. Our results exclude the possibility that courtship decreases resource consumption in H. garnotii, but further study is required to determine whether interspecific mating disrupts parthenogenetic reproduction.

The agonist-induced phosphorylation of MOPr at Ser375, considered a key step in MOPr regulation, and agonist-induced internalization of MOPr were each found to correlate well with arrestin-3 recruitment.

Rodent models offer important insight into how metabolic abnormalities associated with excess body weight can impair immunity. However, more research is necessary to understand the specific aspects of immunity that are impaired and what factors are contributing to reduced immunocompetence in the obese.

Each patient had multiple other failed treatment modalities, including partial pancreatic resection (n=6). They were offered ITNP after a successful intraspinal opioid trial. Etiologies of CP included idiopathy (n=3), cystic fibrosis (n=2), alcohol (n=2), and pancreas divisum (n=6).RESULTS:The median duration of severe, intractable pain prior to ITNP was 6 years (2\u201322 years). The median follow-up time after ITNP was 29 months (range, 7\u201394 months). The ITNP was in situ for a mean duration of 29 months (range, 0.5\u201394 months). Seven patients had pump exchange or removal for various reasons; improvement of pain at month 53 (n=1), meningitis (n=1), meningitis with subsequent replacement (n=1), pump failure at month 31, 68, 79, and 84 (n=4). There were no deaths. The mean pain score prior to implantation (score=8.3, s.d.=0.9) was significantly higher than 1 year after (score=2.7, s.d.=1.9) (P<0.01) and last follow-up (score=0.75, s.d.=2.1) (P<0.01). The median oral narcotic dose before and 1 year after ITNP were morphine sulfate equivalents 337.5\u2009mg per day (range, 67.5\u20131,320) and 40\u2009mg per day (range, 0\u20131,680), respectively (P<0.01). Two patients were considered failures, as they still require a high dosage of both oral and intrathecal medications to control their pain, despite significant pain-score improvement. One patient who was excluded due to meningitis was also considered a failure. Therefore, the overall success rate of ITNP based on an intention-to-treat analysis was 76.9% (10/13). The major complications of ITNP were central nervous system infection requiring pump removal (n=1), cerebrospinal fluid leak requiring laminectomy (n=1), and perispinal abscess with bacterial meningitis requiring pump removal (n=1).CONCLUSIONS:This study shows the many risks and benefits of ITNP.

We show that the basal forebrain (BF) contains at least two distinct neural-coding strategies to support this capacity. The dorsal-lateral BF, including the ventral pallidum (VP), contains reward-sensitive neurons, some of which are selectively suppressed by uncertain-reward predictions (U\u2212). In contrast, the medial BF (mBF) contains reward-sensitive neurons, some of which are selectively enhanced (U+) by uncertain-reward predictions. In a two-alternative choice-task, U\u2212 neurons were selectively suppressed while monkeys chose uncertain options over certain options. During the same choice-epoch, U+ neurons signaled the subjective reward value of the choice options. Additionally, after the choice was reported, U+ neurons signaled reward uncertainty until the choice outcome. We suggest that uncertainty-related suppression of VP may participate in the mediation of uncertainty-seeking actions, whereas uncertainty-related enhancement of the mBF may direct cognitive resources to monitor and learn from uncertain-outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT To survive in an uncertain world, we must approach uncertainty and learn from it. Here we provide evidence for two mostly distinct mechanisms for processing uncertainty about rewards within different subregions of the primate basal forebrain (BF). We found that uncertainty suppressed the representation of certain (or safe) reward values by some neurons in the dorsal-lateral BF, in regions occupied by the ventral pallidum. This uncertainty-related suppression was evident as monkeys made risky choices. We also found that uncertainty-enhanced the activity of many medial BF neurons, most prominently after the monkeys' choices were completed (as they awaited uncertain outcomes). Based on these findings, we propose that different subregions of the BF could support action and learning under uncertainty in distinct but complimentary manners.", "citedAbstract": "It has been suggested that the basal forebrain (BF) exerts strong influences on the formation of memory and behavior. However, what information is used for the memory-behavior formation is unclear. We found that a population of neurons in the medial BF (medial septum and diagonal band of Broca) of macaque monkeys encodes a unique combination of information: reward uncertainty, expected reward value, anticipation of punishment, and unexpected reward and punishment. The results were obtained while the monkeys were expecting (often with uncertainty) a rewarding or punishing outcome during a Pavlovian procedure, or unexpectedly received an outcome outside the procedure. In vivo anterograde tracing using manganese-enhanced MRI suggested that the major recipient of these signals is the intermediate hippocampal formation. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the medial BF identifies various contexts and outcomes that are critical for memory processing in the hippocampal formation.", "citingTitle": "Multiple Mechanisms for Processing Reward Uncertainty in the Primate Basal Forebrain", "citedTitle": "Neurons in the Primate Medial Basal Forebrain Signal Combined Information about Reward Uncertainty, Value, and Punishment Anticipation"}

Although many of the adverse effects of castration therapy are manageable, they can have a detrimental effect on quality of life. Here we evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the non-castration-based therapy bicalutamide (\u2018Casodex\u2019) 150\u00a0mg adjuvant to radiotherapy in patients with T1-4, M0, any n prostate cancer.Methods:The subset of patients within the early prostate cancer (EPC) program who received radiotherapy with curative intent (n\u00a0=\u00a01,370) were included in the analysis. These patients were randomized to receive oral bicalutamide 150\u00a0mg once daily (n\u00a0=\u00a0699) or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a0671).Results:The median follow-up for patients included in this analysis was 7.2\u00a0years. In patients with locally advanced disease (n\u00a0=\u00a0305), bicalutamide adjuvant to radiotherapy significantly improved: progression-free survival (PFS), reducing the risk of objective progression by 44% compared with radiotherapy alone [hazard ratio (HR) 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40, 0.78; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Overall survival, reducing the risk of death by 35% compared with radiotherapy alone (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.44, 0.95; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). This significant overall survival benefit for bicalutamide was driven by a lower risk of prostate cancer-related deaths (16.1 vs 24.3%, respectively). There was no significant difference in PFS or overall survival in patients with localized disease (n\u00a0=\u00a01,065).Conclusions:In patients with locally advanced disease, bicalutamide 150\u00a0mg adjuvant to radiotherapy demonstrates significant clinical benefits in terms of overall survival, PFS and PSA\u2013PFS compared with radiotherapy alone. The overall survival benefit in these patients is consistent with prior studies evaluating castration-based therapies adjuvant to radiotherapy (Bolla et al. in Lancet 360:103\u2013108, 2002; Pilepich et al. in Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 61:1285\u20131290, 2005).

Young males rearing enlarged broods showed a stronger increase in plumage darkness from the current to the next breeding season than those rearing reduced or control broods.

Of these, almost one-quarter are Brassicaceae family members, including numerous Thlaspi species that hyperaccumulate Ni up to 3% of there shoot dry weight. We observed that concentrations of glutathione, Cys, and O-acetyl-l-serine (OAS), in shoot tissue, are strongly correlated with the ability to hyperaccumulate Ni in various Thlaspi hyperaccumulators collected from serpentine soils, including Thlaspi goesingense, T. oxyceras, and T. rosulare, and nonaccumulator relatives, including T. perfoliatum, T. arvense, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Further analysis of the Austrian Ni hyperaccumulator T. goesingense revealed that the high concentrations of OAS, Cys, and GSH observed in this hyperaccumulator coincide with constitutively high activity of both serine acetyltransferase (SAT) and glutathione reductase. SAT catalyzes the acetylation of l-Ser to produce OAS, which acts as both a key positive regulator of sulfur assimilation and forms the carbon skeleton for Cys biosynthesis. These changes in Cys and GSH metabolism also coincide with the ability of T. goesingense to both hyperaccumulate Ni and resist its damaging oxidative effects. Overproduction of T. goesingense SAT in the nonaccumulator Brassicaceae family member Arabidopsis was found to cause accumulation of OAS, Cys, and glutathione, mimicking the biochemical changes observed in the Ni hyperaccumulators. In these transgenic Arabidopsis, glutathione concentrations strongly correlate with increased resistance to both the growth inhibitory and oxidative stress induced effects of Ni. Taken together, such evidence supports our conclusion that elevated GSH concentrations, driven by constitutively elevated SAT activity, are involved in conferring tolerance to Ni-induced oxidative stress in Thlaspi Ni hyperaccumulators.", "citedAbstract": "Copper tolerance among Arabidopsis ecotypes is inversely correlated with long-term K(+) leakage and positively correlated with short-term K(+) leakage (A. Murphy, L. Taiz [1997] New Phytol 136: 211-222). To probe the mechanism of the early phase of K(+) efflux, we tested various channel blockers on copper and peroxide-induced K(+) efflux from seedling roots. The K(+) channel blockers tetraethyl ammonium chloride and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) both inhibited short-term copper-induced K(+) efflux. In contrast, peroxide-induced K(+) efflux was insensitive to both tetraethyl ammonium chloride and 4-AP. Copper-induced lipid peroxidation exhibited a lag time of 4 h, while peroxide-induced lipid peroxidation began immediately. These results suggest that short-term copper-induced K(+) efflux is mediated by channels, while peroxide-induced K(+) efflux represents leakage through nonspecific lesions in the lipid bilayer. Tracer studies with (86)Rb(+) confirmed that copper promotes K(+) efflux rather than inhibiting K(+) uptake. Short-term K(+) release is electroneutral, since electrophysiological measurements indicated that copper does not cause membrane depolarization. Short-term K(+) efflux was accompanied by citrate release, and copper increased total citrate levels. Since citrate efflux was blocked by 4-AP, K(+) appears to serve as a counterion during copper-induced citrate efflux. As copper but not aluminum selectively induces citrate production and release, it is proposed that copper may inhibit a cytosolic form of aconitase.", "citingTitle": "Increased Glutathione Biosynthesis Plays a Role in Nickel Tolerance in Thlaspi Nickel Hyperaccumulators", "citedTitle": "Early copper-induced leakage of K(+) from Arabidopsis seedlings is mediated by ion channels and coupled to citrate efflux."}

It builds predictive models from labeled data. Such learning approaches are useful for many interesting real-world applications, but are particularly useful for tasks involving the automatic categorization, retrieval and extraction of knowledge from large collections of data such as text, images and videos. In traditional supervised learning, one uses \u201dlabeled\u201d data to build a model. However, labeling the training data for real-world applications is difficult, expensive, or time consuming, as it requires the effort of human annotators sometimes with specific domain experience and training. There are implicit costs associated with obtaining these labels from domain experts, such as limited time and financial resources. This is especially true for applications that involve learning with large number of class labels and sometimes with similarities among them. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) addresses this inherent bottleneck by allowing the model to integrate part or all of the available unlabeled data in its supervised learning. The goal is to maximize the learning performance of the model through such newly-labeled examples while minimizing the work required of human annotators. Exploiting unlabeled data to help improve the learning performance has become a hot topic during the last decade and it is divided into four main directions: SSL with graphs, SSL with generative models, semi-supervised support vector machines and SSL by disagreement (SSL with committees). It is interesting to see that semi-supervised learning and ensemble learning are two important paradigms that were developed almost in parallel and with different philosophies. Semi-supervised learning tries to improve generalization performance by exploiting unlabeled data, while ensemble learning tries to achieve the same objective by using multiple predictors. In this thesis, I concentrate on SSL by disagreement and especially on CoTraining style algorithms. Co-Training is a popular SSL algorithm introduced by", "citedAbstract": "This paper shows that the accuracy of learned text classifiers can be improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training documents with a large pool of unlabeled documents. This is important because in many text classification problems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available.We introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. It then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. This basic EM procedure works well when the data conform to the generative assumptions of the model. However these assumptions are often violated in practice, and poor performance can result. We present two extensions to the algorithm that improve classification accuracy under these conditions: (1) a weighting factor to modulate the contribution of the unlabeled data, and (2) the use of multiple mixture components per class. Experimental results, obtained using text from three different real-world tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification error by up to 30%.", "citingTitle": "Semi-supervised learning with committees: exploiting unlabeled data using ensemble learning algorithms", "citedTitle": "Text Classification from Labeled and Unlabeled Documents using EM"}

Our results indicate that individual fitness benefits resulted from associations of philopatric female kin, and support the hypothesis that increased tolerance of proximity of kin is a proximate mechanism for these benefits. The major life-history influence of kin on individual fitness was through improved reproductive success, and this benefit may have been owing to philopatric settlement of kin that were recognized through familiarization in the natal burrow.

Consequently, there has been great interest in determining whether such molecules show biological activity toward protein targets of pharmacological relevance. One target of particular interest is hIKK-2, a serine-threonine protein kinase belonging to the IKK complex that is the primary component responsible for activating NF-\u03baB in response to various inflammatory stimuli. Indeed, this has led to the development of synthetic ATP-competitive inhibitors for hIKK-2. Therefore, the main goals of this study were (a) to use virtual screening to identify potential hIKK-2 inhibitors of natural origin that compete with ATP and (b) to evaluate the reliability of our virtual-screening protocol by experimentally testing the in vitro activity of selected natural-product hits.

The subretinal space of eyes of albino mice raised from birth in complete darkness contained few 5D4+ cells, but exposure to light caused the rapid accumulation of 5D4+ cells at this site. 5D4+ cell density in the subretinal space correlated directly with intensity of ambient light.

Methods A literature review and analysis of published e-health readiness assessment frameworks or models was performed to determine if any are appropriate for broad assessment of e-health readiness in the developing world. A total of 13 papers described e-health readiness in different settings. Results and Discussion Eight types of e-health readiness were identified and no paper directly addressed all of these. The frameworks were based upon varying assumptions and perspectives. There was no underlying unifying theory underpinning the frameworks. Few assessed government and societal readiness, and none cultural readiness; all are important in the developing world. While the shortcomings of existing frameworks have been highlighted, most contain aspects that are relevant and can be drawn on when developing a framework and assessment tools for the developing world.

E-health readiness refers to the readiness of communities and healthcare institutions for the expected changes brought by programs related to Information and Communications Technology (lCT). The present research is conducted aiming at designing E-health Readiness Assessment Framework (EHRAF) in Iran. Methods: The e-health readiness assessment framework was designed based on reviewing literature on e-readiness assessment models and opinions of ICT and health experts. In the next step, Delphi method was used to develop and test the designed framework. Three questionnaires developed to test and modify the model while determining weights of the indices; afterward they were either sent to experts through email or delivered to them in face. Results: The designed framework approved with 4 dimensions, 11 constituents and 58 indices. Technical readiness had the highest importance coefficient (0.256099), and the other dimensions were of the next levels of coefficient importance: core readiness (0.25520), social communication readiness (0.244658), and engagement readiness (0.244039). Conclusion: The framework presents the movement route and investment priorities in e-health in Iran. The proposed framework is a good instrument for measuring the e-readiness in health centers in Iran, and for identifying strengths and weaknesses of these centers to access ICT and its implementation for more effectiveness and for analyzing digital divide between them, as well.", "citingTitle": "Critical analysis of e-health readiness assessment frameworks: suitability for application in developing countries", "citedTitle": "E-Health Readiness Assessment Framework in Iran"}

In most brain regions, levels of primary transcript expression of GAP\u201043 were highly correlated with levels of its mRNA. However, there were notable dissociations: in hippocampal granule cells, high levels of primary transcript were evident yet no GAP\u201043 mRNA was detected. In locus coeruleus the reverse was true; there were high levels of GAP\u201043 mRNA but no detectable primary transcript. A primary transcript antitermination mechanism is proposed to explain the first dissociation, and a post\u2010transcriptional mRNA stabilization mechanism to explain the second. Transcriptional activation during nerve regeneration was monitored by assessing primary transcript induction of GAP\u201043 in mouse facial motor neurons. This induction, as well as its mRNA, was restricted to the side of the facial nerve crush. Increases were first observed at 24\u2003h with a rapid increase in both measures up to 3\u2003days.

This provided new evidence that formaldehyde was not the main toxicant associated with GST-mediated DCM conversion, and indicated that an intermediate in the transformation of DCM by GST, presumably S-chloromethylglutathione, was responsible for the observed effects.

It is identified by its rapid, invasive progression with a profound resistance to treatments such as chemotherapy. Unfortunately, there is a lack of information on how to effectively inhibit and control the rapid growth of pancreatic tumors, as well as limited information for diagnostics. With current methods, pancreatic cancer will continue to prevail as a leading cause of cancer death. We propose to study the complexity of pancreatic tumors with a systematic and analytical approach. Cancer is an abnormal growth of tissue caused by uncontrolled cell division. Observing the growth of these cells would prove to have a good basis to monitor the growth of a tumor. Here we create a 3-D simulation of tumor growth through mathematical modeling, using data from pancreatic cells grown in vitro. Using 3-D models will help to understand pancreatic tumors at cellular and molecular levels. The project aims to observe realistic growth of the tumor, accomplished from growing tumor cells on a monolayer in order to find parameters for our 3D mathematical model. This method will prove more beneficial than testing only on a monolayer cell line. Although cell death and the toxicity of drug dosage can be tested using a cell monolayer alone, it does not meet the demands of testing drug delivery in a realistic tumor environment that the mathematical model would provide. The monolayer lacks the dimensions that the drug would have to travel if it were delivered to a real in vivo tumor. A possible continuation of this project in the future could be to utilize the mathematical based approach to predict optimal therapy for the pancreatic tumor in order to develop models that can better test patient care for tumors. Computer modeling, another stepping stone through mathematical modeling, will possibly lead to testing the toxic effects of drugs on a 3-D model through computer modeling will aid in understanding the delivery of drugs throughout the tumor in vivo.", "citedAbstract": "Abstract\u2002We study solid tumor (carcinoma) growth in the nonlinear regime using boundary-integral simulations. The tumor core is nonnecrotic and no inhibitor chemical species are present. A new formulation of the classical models [18,24,8,3] is developed and it is demonstrated that tumor evolution is described by a reduced set of two dimensionless parameters and is qualitatively unaffected by the number of spatial dimensions. One parameter describes the relative rate of mitosis to the relaxation mechanisms (cell mobility and cell-to-cell adhesion). The other describes the balance between apoptosis (programmed cell-death) and mitosis. Both parameters also include the effect of vascularization. Our analysis and nonlinear simulations reveal that the two new dimensionless groups uniquely subdivide tumor growth into three regimes associated with increasing degrees of vascularization: low (diffusion dominated, e.g., in vitro), moderate and high vascularization, that correspond to the regimes observed in vivo. We demonstrate that critical conditions exist for which the tumor evolves to nontrivial dormant states or grows self-similarly (i.e., shape invariant) in the first two regimes. This leads to the possibility of shape control and of controlling the release of tumor angiogenic factors by restricting the tumor volume-to-surface-area ratio. Away from these critical conditions, evolution may be unstable leading to invasive fingering into the external tissues and to topological transitions such as tumor breakup and reconnection. Interestingly we find that for highly vascularized tumors, while they grow unbounded, their shape always stays compact and invasive fingering does not occur. This is in agreement with recent experimental observations [30] of in vivo tumor growth, and suggests that the invasive growth of highly-vascularized tumors is associated to vascular and elastic anisotropies, which are not included in the model studied here.\n", "citingTitle": "Biomodeling of pancreatic tumor mass.", "citedTitle": "Nonlinear simulation of tumor growth"}

In the present study, we have examined the interaction of monoamines and peptides on C. elegans aversive behavior mediated by a pair of polymodal, nociceptive, ASH sensory neurons. Food or serotonin sensitize the ASHs and stimulate aversive responses through a pathway requiring the release of nlp-3-encoded neuropeptides from the ASHs. Peptides encoded by nlp-3 appear to stimulate ASH-mediated aversive behavior through the neuropeptide receptor-17 (NPR-17) receptor. nlp-3- and npr-17-null animals exhibit identical phenotypes and animals overexpressing either nlp-3 or npr-17 exhibit elevated aversive responses off food that are absent when nlp-3 or npr-17 are overexpressed in npr-17- or nlp-3-null animals, respectively. ASH-mediated aversive responses are increased by activating either G\u03b1q or G\u03b1s in the ASHs, with G\u03b1s signaling specifically stimulating the release of nlp-3-encoded peptides. In contrast, octopamine appears to inhibit 5-HT stimulation by activating G\u03b1o signaling in the ASHs that, in turn, inhibits both G\u03b1s and G\u03b1q signaling and the release of nlp-3-encoded peptides.

This Review highlights pathological commonality, showing that OSA upregulates A\u03b2, tau hyperphosphorylation, and synaptic dysfunction. Indeed, OSA and hypertension trigger hypoperfusion and hypometabolism of brain regions, including cortex and hippocampus. Several studies show that hypertension\u2010driven brain damage and pathogenic mechanisms lead to an A\u03b2 increase. The pathophysiological mechanism by which OSA enhances hypertension may be linked to sympathoexcitation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. Strong pathophysiological similarities that exist between OSA and AD are underscored here. For example, the hippocampus is negatively impacted in both OSA and AD. OSA promotes hippocampal atrophy, which is associated with memory impairment. Cognitive impairment, even in the absence of manifest dementia, is an important independent predictor of mortality. However, several pathophysiological mechanisms in OSA are reversible with appropriate therapy. OSA, therefore, is a modifiable risk factor of cognitive dysfunction, and treating OSA prior to mild cognitive impairment may be an effective prevention strategy to reduce risk for cognitive decline and AD in middle\u2010aged persons and the elderly. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "citedAbstract": "AbstractThe purpose of the present study was to compare exercise status during the follicular (FP) and luteal (LP) phases of the menstrual cycle of a single group of young, sedentary women, where the marked differential in the blood concentrations of 17\u03b2-oestradiol ([E2]) and progesterone ([P4]) has the potential to alter the metabolic response to exercise.

With the incremental exercise test, time to exhaustion, maximal power output and total work done were not different between the two phases, nor were the absolute values for\nV\u0307O2peak or the corresponding values for ventilation (V\u0307E), respiratory frequency (fR) and heart rate (HR). Resting, end-exercise and peak (post-exercise) plasma lactate concentrations and the lactate threshold were not different between the two phases either. However, as the workloads increased during the incremental protocol, plasma lactate concentration, carbon dioxide output (V\u0307CO2) and the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) all were lower during LP, while oxygen uptake (V\u0307O2) was higher. With steady-state submaximal exercise, at workloads corresponding to 25% and 75% of menstrual cycle phase-specific\nV\u0307O2peak, V\u0307O2 and the oxygen pulse (V\u0307O2/HR) were higher and RER and plasma lactate concentration lower during LP. Regardless of phase, [E2] increased with both incremental and steady-state submaximal exercise, while [P4] was unchanged. It is concluded that while exercise capacity, as defined by\nV\u0307O2peak and the lactate threshold, is unaffected by cycle phase in young, sedentary women, the metabolic responses in the LP during both incremental and steady-state submaximal exercise suggest a greater dependence on fat as an energy source.", "citingTitle": "Evidence of neurodegeneration in obstructive sleep apnea: Relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly", "citedTitle": "Impact of menstrual cycle phase on the exercise status of young, sedentary women"}

To investigate how tumor angiogenesis correlates with metastases in breast carcinoma, we counted microvessels (capillaries and venules) and graded the density of microvessels within the initial invasive carcinomas of 49 patients (30 with metastases and 19 without).\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing light microscopy, we highlighted the vessels by staining their endothelial cells immunocytochemically for factor VIII. The microvessels were carefully counted (per 200x field), and their density was graded (1 to 4+), in the most active areas of neovascularization, without knowledge of the outcome in the patient, the presence or absence of metastases, or any other pertinent variable.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth microvessel counts and density grades correlated with metastatic disease. The mean (+/- SD) count and grade in the patients with metastases were 101 +/- 49.3 and 2.95 +/- 1.00 vessels, respectively. The corresponding values in the patients without metastases were significantly lower--45 +/- 21.1 and 1.38 +/- 0.82 (P = 0.003 and P less than or equal to 0.001, respectively). For each 10-microvessel increase in the count per 200x field, there was a 1.59-fold increase in the risk of metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 2.12; P = 0.003). The microvessel count and density grade also correlated with distant metastases. For each 10-microvessel increase in the vessel count per 200x field, there was a 1.17-fold increase in the risk of distant metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34; P = 0.029).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe number of microvessels per 200x field in the areas of most intensive neovascularization in an invasive breast carcinoma may be an independent predictor of metastatic disease either in axillary lymph nodes or at distant sites (or both).

Methodology/Principal Findings Using GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that Rtt106 physically interacts with both the SWI/SNF and RSC complexes in vitro and in vivo. We then investigated the function of this interaction with respect to the recruitment of these complexes to HIR-dependent histone genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP), we found that Rtt106 is important for the recruitment of both SWI/SNF and RSC complexes to the HIR-dependent histone genes. Furthermore, using synchronized cell cultures, we showed by ChIP assays that the Rtt106-dependent SWI/SNF recruitment to these histone gene loci is cell cycle regulated and restricted to late G1 phase just before the peak of histone gene expression in S phase. Conclusions/Significance Overall, these data strongly suggest that the interaction between the histone chaperone Rtt106 and both the SWI/SNF and RSC chromatin remodeling complexes is important for the cell cycle regulated recruitment of these two complexes to the HIR-dependent histone genes.", "citedAbstract": "Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the evolutionarily conserved Swi/Snf complex acts at a subset of genes to help transcriptional activators function on chromatin templates.

Because of its role in both depressive and addictive behaviors, the galanin system is a strong candidate for such a mechanism. In this study, we tested if galanin and its receptors are involved in stress-associated behaviors and drug addiction. Mice were exposed to 21 days of chronic restraint stress (CRS); subsequently, mRNA levels of galanin, galanin receptors (GalRs), the rate-limiting enzymes for the synthesis of monoamines, and monoamine autoreceptors were measured in the nucleus accumbens by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, we tested the effects of this stress on morphine-induced addictive behaviors. We found that CRS induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors, impaired the formation and facilitated the extinction process in morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), and also blocked morphine-induced behavioral sensitization. These behavioral results were accompanied by a CRS-dependent increase in the mRNA expression of galanin, GalR1, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), tryptophan hydroxylase 2, and 5-HT1B receptor. Interestingly, treatment with a commonly used antidepressant, fluoxetine, normalized the CRS-induced behavioral changes based on reversing the higher expression of galanin and TH while increasing the expression of GalR2 and \u03b12A-adrenceptor. These results indicate that activating the galanin system, with corresponding changes to noradrenergic systems, following chronic stress may modulate stress-associated behaviors and opiate addiction. Our findings suggest that galanin and GalRs are worthy of further exploration as potential therapeutic targets to treat stress-related disorders and drug addiction.", "citedAbstract": "Stressors can exert a wide variety of responses, ranging from adaptive responses to pathological changes; moreover, recent studies suggest that mild stressors can attenuate the response of a system to major stressful events. We have previously shown that 2\u2010week exposure to cold, a comparatively mild inescapable stressor, induced a pronounced reduction in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neuron activity, whereas restraint stress increases DA neuron activity. However, it is not known if these stressors differentially impact the VTA in a region\u2010specific manner, if they differentially impact behavioral responses, or whether the effects of such different stressors are additive or antagonistic with regard to their impact on DA neuron firing. To address these questions, single\u2010unit extracellular recordings were performed in anesthetized control rats and rats exposed to chronic cold, and tested after delivery of a 2\u2010h restraint session. Chronic cold stress strongly attenuated the number of DA neurons firing in the VTA, and this effect occurred primarily in the medial and central VTA regions that preferentially project to reward\u2010related ventral striatal regions. Chronic cold exposure also prevented the pronounced increase in DA neuron population activity without affecting the behavioral sensitization to amphetamine produced by restraint stress.

To promote commensalism in animals and disease in humans, Campylobacter jejuni produces a flagellar organelle for motility.

In this study, an unusual phase\u2010variable mechanism controlling production of FlgR, the response regulator of the FlgSR two\u2010component system required for transcription of \u03c354\u2010dependent flagellar genes, is identified. Phase variation of FlgR production is due to loss or gain of a nucleotide in homopolymeric adenine or thymine tracts within flgR.

These findings provide more understanding into the genetic and colonization strategies C.\u2003jejuni employs to achieve commensalism in a natural host. Second, due to the richness of the C.\u2003jejuni genome in adenine or thymine residues and the apparent lack of the normal set of mismatch repair enzymes, the results from this study may suggest that the C.\u2003jejuni genome is more unstable and variable than previously realized.

Objective and Methods The purpose of this study was to follow the evolution of the airway microbiota in CF patients treated with ivacaftor, using quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons, in order to identify quantitative and qualitative changes in bacterial communities. Three G551D children were followed up longitudinally over a mean period of more than one year covering several months before and after initiation of ivacaftor treatment.

Here, we investigated the modulation of DDR signaling during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Phosphorylation of representative DDR-associated proteins, such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and H2AX, was induced as early as 30 min (0.5 h) postinfection and persisted during in vitro KSHV latency. Phosphorylated H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) colocalized at 30 min (0.5 h) with the KSHV genome entering the nuclei. Total H2AX protein levels also increased, and the increase was attributed to a decrease in degradative H2AX Lys48-linked polyubiquitination with a concomitant increase in Lys63-linked polyubiquitination that was shown to increase protein stability. ATM and H2AX phosphorylation and \u03b3H2AX nuclear foci were also induced by UV-inactivated KSHV, which ceased at later times of infection. Inhibition of ATM kinase activity by KU-55933 and H2AX knockdown by small interfering RNA significantly reduced the expression of the KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen 1 (LANA-1; ORF73) and LANA-1 nuclear puncta. Knockdown of H2AX also resulted in a >80% reduction in the nuclear KSHV DNA copy numbers. Similar results were also observed in ATM-negative cells, although comparable levels of viral DNA entered ATM-negative and ATM-positive cell nuclei. In contrast, knockdown of CHK1 and CHK2 did not affect ORF73 expression. Collectively, these results demonstrate that KSHV induces ATM and H2AX, a selective arm of the DDR, for the establishment and maintenance of its latency during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells. IMPORTANCE Eukaryotic cells mount a DNA damage response (DDR) to sense and repair different types of cellular DNA damage. In addition, DDR also recognizes exogenous genetic material, such as the viral DNA genome entering the nucleus during infections. The present study was undertaken to determine whether de novo Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection modulates DDR. Our results demonstrate that early during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells, KSHV induces a selective arm of DDR signaling, such as the ATM kinase and its downstream target, H2AX, which are essential for KSHV's latent gene expression and the establishment of latency. These studies suggest that targeting ATM and H2AX could serve as an attractive strategy to block the establishment of KSHV latent infection and the associated malignancies.", "citedAbstract": "ABSTRACT The DNA damage response (DDR) of host cells is utilized by a number of viruses to establish and propagate their genomes in the infected cells. We examined the expression of the DDR genes during Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The genes were mostly downregulated, except H2AX, which was upregulated during infection. H2AX is important for gammaherpesvirus infectivity, and its phosphorylation at serine 139 is crucial for maintenance of latency during mouse gamma-herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) infection. We now also observed phosphorylation of H2AX at serine 139 during KSHV infection. H2AX is a histone H2A isoform shown to interact with the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) encoded by KSHV. Here, we show that LANA directly interacted with H2AX through domains at both its N and C termini. The phosphorylated form of H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) was shown to colocalize with LANA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that a reduction in H2AX levels resulted in reduced binding of LANA with KSHV terminal repeats (TRs). Binding preferences of H2AX and \u03b3H2AX along the KSHV episome were examined by whole-episome ChIP analysis. We showed that \u03b3H2AX had a higher relative binding activity along the TR regions than that of the long unique region (LUR), which highlighted the importance of H2AX phosphorylation during KSHV infection. Furthermore, knockdown of H2AX resulted in decreased KSHV episome copy number. Notably, the C terminus of LANA contributed to phosphorylation of H2AX. However, phosphorylation was not dependent on the ability of LANA to drive KSHV-infected cells into S-phase. Thus, H2AX contributes to association of LANA with the TRs, and phosphorylation of H2AX is likely important for its increased density at the TRs.", "citingTitle": "Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus Induces the ATM and H2AX DNA Damage Response Early during De Novo Infection of Primary Endothelial Cells, Which Play Roles in Latency Establishment", "citedTitle": "H2AX Phosphorylation Is Important for LANA-Mediated Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus Episome Persistence"}

On average, females with higher numbers of co-breeding kin did not increase energy income but biased energy allocation towards reproduction. Co-breeding female kin ground squirrels maintain close nest burrows, likely providing a social buffer against territorial invasions from non-kin ground squirrels.

We applied an individual fitness approach to a 16-year study of Columbian ground squirrels (Urocitellus columbianus) to investigate potential causal paths by which the presence of kin might act on individual fitness. Our results indicate that individual fitness benefits resulted from associations of philopatric female kin, and support the hypothesis that increased tolerance of proximity of kin is a proximate mechanism for these benefits. The major life-history influence of kin on individual fitness was through improved reproductive success, and this benefit may have been owing to philopatric settlement of kin that were recognized through familiarization in the natal burrow.

Although several correlates of invasion success have been identified, patterns alone cannot identify the mechanisms underlying the invasion process. Here, we test the hypothesis that one predictor of invasion success, behavioral flexibility, is different between invading and established populations of the same species of bird. We predicted that neophobia (fear of novelty), a surrogate of behavioral flexibility, would be weaker in an actively invading population (28 years resident; Colon, Republic of Panama) of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) compared to a population that had been resident for more than 150 years (Princeton, New Jersey, USA). To test this hypothesis, we compared latency to consume novel foods and phobia of novel objects between populations when both were kept under similar environmental conditions in captivity. As predicted, birds from the 150-year-old population took significantly longer to approach and consume novel foods than birds from the 28-year-old population. Responses to novel objects were not different between populations however; both populations fed more readily near some novel objects, which to our knowledge is the first such occurrence in a wild vertebrate species. Overall, a predilection for trying new foods and being attracted to novel objects may in part explain how this species has so successfully invaded new areas. Copyright 2005.", "citedAbstract": "Biotic invaders are species that establish a new range in which they proliferate, spread, and persist to the detriment of the environment. They are the most important ecological outcomes from the unprecedented alterations in the distribution of the earth's biota brought about largely through human transport and commerce. In a world without borders, few if any areas remain sheltered from these im- migrations. The fate of immigrants is decidedly mixed. Few survive the hazards of chronic and stochastic forces, and only a small fraction become naturalized. In turn, some naturalized species do become invasive. There are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites; others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native communities. Ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and uncontrollable. Whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) Animal invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing, competition, and habitat alteration. (2) Plant invaders can completely alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival of native species. (3) In agriculture, the principal pests of temperate crops are nonindigenous, and the combined expenses of pest control and crop losses constitute an onerous \"tax\" on food, fiber, and forage production. (4) The global cost of virulent plant and animal diseases caused by parasites transported to new ranges and presented with susceptible new hosts is currently incalculable. Identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their dispersal and establishment con- stitutes an enormous challenge to both conservation and international commerce. Detection and management when exclusion fails have proved daunting for varied reasons: (1) Efforts to identify general attributes of future invaders have often been inconclusive. (2) Predicting susceptible locales for future invasions seems even more problematic, given the enormous differences in the rates of arrival among potential invaders. (3) Eradication of an established invader is rare, and control efforts vary enormously in their efficacy. Successful control, however, depends more on commitment and continuing diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools themselves. (4) Control of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a long-term, ecosystem- wide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on battling individual invaders. (5) Prevention of invasions is much less costly than post-entry control. Revamping national and international quarantine laws by adopting a \"guilty until proven innocent\" approach would be a productive first step. Failure to address the issue of biotic invasions could effectively result in severe global consequences, including wholesale loss of agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources in some regions, disruption of the ecological processes that supply natural services on which human enterprise depends, and the creation of homogeneous, impoverished ecosystems composed of cosmopolitan species. Given their current scale, biotic invasions have taken their place alongside human-driven atmospheric and oceanic alterations as major agents of global change.

Immunological defense mechanisms act in concert with physiological processes like growth and reproduction, energy intake and metabolism, as well as neuronal development. Not only are psychological and environmental stressors communicated to the immune system, but also, vice versa, the immune response and adaptation to a current pathogen challenge are communicated to the entire body, including the brain, to evoke adaptive responses (e.g., fever, sickness behavior) that ensure allocation of energy to fight the pathogen. This phenomenon is evolutionarily conserved. Hence it is both interesting and important to consider the evolutionary history of this bi-directional neuroendocrine-immune communication to reveal phylogenetically ancient or relatively recently acquired mechanisms. Indeed, such considerations have already disclosed an extensive \"common vocabulary\" of information pathways as well as molecules and their receptors used by both the neuroendocrine and immune systems. This review focuses on the principal mechanisms of bi-directional communication and the evidence for evolutionary conservation of the important physiological pathways involved.", "citedAbstract": "Parent-offspring conflicts lead the offspring to evolve reliable signals of individual quality, including parasite burden, which may allow parents to adaptively modulate investment in the progeny. Sex-related variation in offspring reproductive value, however, may entail differential investment in sons and daughters. Here, we experimentally manipulated offspring condition in the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) by subjecting nestlings to an immune challenge (injection with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, LPS) that simulates a bacterial infection, and assessed the effects on growth, feather quality, expression of morphological (gape coloration) and behavioral (posture) begging displays involved in parent-offspring communication, as well as on food allocation by parents. Compared to sham-injected controls, LPS-treated chicks suffered a depression of body mass and a reduction of palate color saturation. In addition, LPS treatment resulted in lower feather quality, with an increase in the occurrence of fault bars on wing feathers. The color of beak flanges, feather growth and the intensity of postural begging were affected by LPS treatment only in females, suggesting that chicks of either sex are differently susceptible to the immune challenge. However, irrespective of the effects of LPS, parents equally allocated food among control and challenged offspring both under normal food provisioning and after a short period of food deprivation of the chicks. These results indicate that bacterial infection and the associated immune response entail different costs to offspring of either sex, but a decrease in nestling conditions does not affect parental care allocation, possibly because the barn swallow adopts a brood-survival strategy. Finally, we showed that physiological stress induced by pathogens impairs plumage quality, a previously neglected major negative impact of bacterial infection which could severely affect fitness, particularly among long-distance migratory birds.", "citingTitle": "Neuroendocrine-immune interaction: Evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that maintain allostasis in an ever-changing environment.", "citedTitle": "Sex-Related Effects of an Immune Challenge on Growth and Begging Behavior of Barn Swallow Nestlings"}

Exciting voxels with tailored 3D shapes reduces partial volume effects and enhances contrast, particularly in cases where cubic voxels or other simple geometries do not provide an optimal localization. Spatial excitation profiles of arbitrary shapes can be implemented using so-called multidimensional RF pulses, which are often limited in practice to 2D implementations owing to their sensitivity to field inhomogeneities. Recent work has shown the potential of spatio-temporally encoded (SPEN) pulses towards alleviating these constraints. In particular, 2D pulses operating in a so-called hybrid scheme where the \"low-bandwidth\" spatial dimension is sculpted by a SPEN strategy while an orthogonal axis is shaped by regular k-space encoding, have been shown resilient to chemical shift and B0 field inhomogeneities. In this work we explore the use of pairs of 2D pulses, with one of these addressing geometries in the x-y plane and the other in the x-z dimension, to sculpt complex 3D volumes in phantoms and in vivo. To overcome limitations caused by the RF discretization demanded by these 2D pulses, a number of \"unfolding\" techniques yielding images from the centerband RF excitation while deleting sideband contributions - even in cases where center- and side-bands severely overlap - were developed. Thus it was possible to increase the gradient strengths applied along the low bandwidth dimensions, significantly improving the robustness of this kind of 3D sculpting pulses.

The present study extends those imaging developments, by introducing a new class of multidimensional excitation pulses that relies on SPEN concepts. We focus in particular on a family of \"hybrid\" 2D radiofrequency (RF) pulses that operate in both direct and reciprocal excitation space, and which can spatially sculpt the spin magnetization in manners that are beyond the reach of sequential 1D pulse shaping. These SPEN-based 2D pulses are compatible with a majority of single- and multi-scan imaging techniques.

In this paper, the modulated radiation force is analytically derived in the case of attenuating media, by expanding on the theory of ultrasound-stimulated-vibro-acoustography (USVA) for lossless media.

As an extension of previous research, we examined the unique variance accounted for by fear of negative evaluation (FNE) and fear of positive evaluation (FPE) in the relationship between SA and interpretation biases, using a paradigm that collected both reaction time and self-report data. FPE accounted for significant variance in the relationship between SA and negative interpretation bias at a faster level of processing (reaction time measure). However, neither FNE nor FPE accounted for significant variance in the relationship between SA and negative interpretation bias at a slower level of processing (self-report measure).

We argue that the amount of perceptual and other semantic information that can be learned from purely distributional statistics has been underappreciated. We compare the representations of three feature-based and nine distributional models using a semantic clustering task. Several distributional models demonstrated semantic clustering comparable with clustering-based on feature-based representations. Furthermore, when trained on child-directed speech, the same distributional models perform as well as sensorimotor-based feature representations of children's lexical semantic knowledge. These results suggest that, to a large extent, information relevant for extracting semantic categories is redundantly coded in perceptual and linguistic experience. Detailed analyses of the semantic clusters of the feature-based and distributional models also reveal that the models make use of complementary cues to semantic organization from the two data streams.

Despite the fundamental biological importance of this process, the selective forces that operate to shape recombination rate and patterns are unclear.

In domesticates, intense selection for particular traits is imposed on small populations over many generations, resulting in organisms that differ, sometimes dramatically, in morphology and physiology from their wild ancestor. Although earlier studies suggested increased recombination rate in domesticates, a formal comparison of recombination rates between domestic mammals and their wild congeners was missing. In order to determine broad-scale recombination rate, we used immunolabeling detection of MLH1 foci as crossover markers in spermatocytes in three pairs of closely related wild and domestic species (dog and wolf, goat and ibex, and sheep and mouflon). In the three pairs, and contrary to previous suggestions, our data show that contemporary recombination rate is higher in the wild species. Subsequently, we inferred recombination breakpoints in sequence data for 16 genomic regions in dogs and wolves, each containing a locus associated with a dog phenotype potentially under selection during domestication. No difference in the number and distribution of recombination breakpoints was found between dogs and wolves. We conclude that our data indicate that strong directional selection did not result in changes in recombination in domestic mammals, and that both upper and lower bounds for crossover rates may be tightly regulated.", "citedAbstract": "Analysis of diverse eukaryotes has revealed that recombination events cluster in discrete genomic locations known as hotspots. In humans, a zinc-finger protein, PRDM9, is believed to initiate recombination in >40% of hotspots by binding to a specific DNA sequence motif. However, the PRDM9 coding sequence is disrupted in the dog genome assembly, raising questions regarding the nature and control of recombination in dogs. By analyzing the sequences of PRDM9 orthologs in a number of dog breeds and several carnivores, we show here that this gene was inactivated early in canid evolution. We next use patterns of linkage disequilibrium using more than 170,000 SNP markers typed in almost 500 dogs to estimate the recombination rates in the dog genome using a coalescent-based approach. Broad-scale recombination rates show good correspondence with an existing linkage-based map. Significant variation in recombination rate is observed on the fine scale, and we are able to detect over 4000 recombination hotspots with high confidence. In contrast to human hotspots, 40% of canine hotspots are characterized by a distinct peak in GC content. A comparative genomic analysis indicates that these peaks are present also as weaker peaks in the panda, suggesting that the hotspots have been continually reinforced by accelerated and strongly GC biased nucleotide substitutions, consistent with the long-term action of biased gene conversion on the dog lineage. These results are consistent with the loss of PRDM9 in canids, resulting in a greater evolutionary stability of recombination hotspots. The genetic determinants of recombination hotspots in the dog genome may thus reflect a fundamental process of relevance to diverse animal species.", "citingTitle": "Strong artificial selection in domestic mammals did not result in an increased recombination rate.", "citedTitle": "Death of PRDM9 coincides with stabilization of the recombination landscape in the dog genome."}

Generation of this proper spatial regulation requires that individual proteins be targeted to specific substructures within the spindle. For example, the kinesin-related protein CENP-E is targeted specifically to the corona fibers of kinetochores (Yao et al., 1997) where its action is required during alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate (Schaar et al., 1997; Wood et al., 1997). In contrast, the protein NuMA (nuclear mitotic antigen) is concentrated at spindle poles where its activity appears to be required for the focused organization of microtubules (Gaglio et al., 1995). The vertebrate mitotic spindle pole is a microtubuledependent region surrounding the centrioles and centrosome at each of the two ends of the bipolar mitotic spindle. NuMA, \u03b3tubulin and katanin are proteins whose localization define the spindle pole. NuMA associates exclusively with the microtubule-dependent spindle pole during mitosis and does not associate with interphase centrosomes (Price and Pettijohn, 1986; Dionne et al., 1999). In contrast, localization of \u03b3-tubulin to the interphase or mitotic centrosome does not require intact microtubules (Khodjakov and Rieder, 1999; Stearns et al., 1991; Zheng et al., 1991). However, localization of additional \u03b3-tubulin that surrounds the centrosomes only during mitosis does require microtubules (McNally and Thomas, 1998; Khodjakov and Rieder, 1999). Like NuMA, the sea urchin protein, katanin, is concentrated in a microtubule-dependent structure surrounding the \u03b3-tubulin at the poles of embryonic spindles (McNally et al., 1996). Antibodies recognizing mammalian homologs of katanin also recognize large microtubule-dependent structures surrounding \u03b3-tubulin foci at spindle poles in several cell types and, in addition, recognize a smaller microtubule-independent focus at the centrosome in some cell types (McNally and Thomas, 1998). Sea urchin katanin severs microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner in vitro (McNally and Vale, 1993) and is thought to be important in releasing microtubules from their centrosomal attachment points in vivo. Indeed, microinjection of antibodies recognizing a vertebrate katanin homolog into neurons results in the accumulation of microtubules attached to the centrosome (Ahmad et al., 1999), indicating that katanin-mediated microtubule severing is responsible for the release of microtubules from the neuronal centrosome. The concentration of katanin in mitotic spindle poles (McNally and Thomas, 1998) and the specific activation of katanin\u2019s activity in Mphase Xenopus extracts (Vale, 1991; McNally and Thomas, 1998) suggest that katanin may also sever microtubules from their centrosomal attachments during mitosis in non-neuronal cells. Katanin\u2019s localization in spindle poles may increase the efficiency of this centrosomal release reaction and thus allow 1623 Journal of Cell Science 113, 1623-1633 (2000) Printed in Great Britain \u00a9 The Company of Biologists Limited 2000 JCS1028", "citedAbstract": "Microtubules are dynamic structures whose proper rearrangement during the cell cycle is essential for the positioning of membranes during interphase and for chromosome segregation during mitosis. The previous discovery of a cyclin B/cdc2-activated microtubule-severing activity in M-phase Xenopus egg extracts suggested that a microtubule-severing protein might play an important role in cell cycle-dependent changes in microtubule dynamics and organization. However, the isolation of three different microtubule-severing proteins, p56, EF1alpha, and katanin, has only confused the issue because none of these proteins is directly activated by cyclin B/cdc2. Here we use immunodepletion with antibodies specific for a vertebrate katanin homologue to demonstrate that katanin is responsible for the majority of M-phase severing activity in Xenopus eggs. This result suggests that katanin is responsible for changes in microtubules occurring at mitosis. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that katanin is concentrated at a microtubule-dependent structure at mitotic spindle poles in Xenopus A6 cells and in human fibroblasts, suggesting a specific role in microtubule disassembly at spindle poles. Surprisingly, katanin was also found in adult mouse brain, indicating that katanin may have other functions distinct from its mitotic role.", "citingTitle": "Two domains of p 80 katanin regulate microtubule severing and spindle pole targeting by p 60 katanin", "citedTitle": "Katanin is responsible for the M-phase microtubule-severing activity in Xenopus eggs."}

Pre-equilibrium states of the association reaction were captured by reacting the mixture of ribosomal subunits for 60\u00a0ms and 140\u00a0ms.

The RSS contains highly conserved heptamer (consensus: 5'-CACAGTG) and nonamer (consensus: 5'-ACAAAAACC) motifs separated by either 12- or 23-base pairs of poorly conserved sequence. The high mobility group proteins HMGB1 and HMGB2 (HMGB1/2) are highly abundant architectural DNA binding proteins known to promote RAG-mediated synapsis and cleavage of consensus recombination signals in vitro by facilitating RSS binding and bending by the RAG1/2 complex. HMGB1/2 are known to recognize distorted DNA structures such as four-way junctions, and damaged or modified DNA. Whether HMGB1/2 can promote RAG-mediated DNA cleavage at sites lacking a canonical RSS by targeting or stabilizing structural distortions is unclear, but is important for understanding the etiology of chromosomal translocations involving antigen receptor genes and proto-oncogene sequences that do not contain an obvious RSS-like element.ResultsHere we identify a novel DNA breakpoint site in the plasmid V(D)J recombination substrate pGG49 (bps6197) that is cleaved by the RAG proteins via a nick-hairpin mechanism. The bps6197 sequence lacks a recognizable heptamer at the breakpoint (5'-CCTGACG-3') but contains a nonamer-like element (5'-ACATTAACC-3') 30 base pairs from the cleavage site. We find that RAG-mediated bps6197 cleavage is promoted by HMGB1/2, requiring both HMG-box domains to be intact to facilitate RAG-mediated cleavage, and is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-RSS. A dyad-symmetric inverted repeat sequence lying 5' to the breakpoint is implicated as a target for HMGB1/2 activity.ConclusionWe have identified a novel DNA sequence, called bps6197, that supports standard V(D)J-type cleavage despite the absence of an apparent heptamer motif. Efficient RAG-mediated bps6197 cleavage requires the presence of HMGB1/2, is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-RSS partner, and is directed in part by an inverted repeat sequence adjacent to the DNA cleavage site.

To understand the molecular basis for these large differences, we investigated the binding and cleavage of these cRSSs by the RAG1/2 proteins that initiate V(D)J recombination. We find that the RAG proteins comparably bind all cRSSs tested, albeit more poorly than a consensus RSS. We show that four cRSSs that support levels of V(D)J recombination above background levels in cell culture (LMO2, TAL1, Ttg-1, and SIL) are also cleaved by the RAG proteins in vitro with efficiencies ranging from 18 to 70% of a consensus RSS. Cleavage of LMO2 and Ttg-1 by the RAG proteins can also be detected in cell culture using ligation-mediated PCR.

More formally, given is a set of patterns x1, ...,xn grouped into bags X1, ..., Xm, with Xj = {xi : i \u2208 Ij} and Ij \u2286 {1, ..., n}.

Another application is in image retrieval where images can be viewed as bags of local image patches (Maron & Ratan 1998) or image regions. Algorithms for the MIL problem were first presented in (Dietterich, Lathrop, & Lozano-Perez 1997; Auer 1997; Long & Tan 1996). These methods (and analytical results) are based on hypothesis classes consisting of axisaligned rectangles. Similarly, methods developed subsequently (e.g., (Maron & Lozano-Perez 1998; Zhang & Goldman 2002)) have focused on specially tailored machine learning algorithms that do not compare favorably in the limiting case of bags of size 1 (the standard classification setting). A notable exception is (Ramon & Raedt 2000).", "citingTitle": "Systematically Differentiating Functions for Alternatively Spliced Isoforms through Integrating RNA-seq Data", "citedTitle": "Multiple instance learning with generalized support vector machines"}

Femoral strain can be calculated using a reference musculoskeletal model scaled to participant anatomies (referred to as scaled-generic) combined with finite-element models. However, anthropometric errors committed while scaling affect the calculation of femoral strains. We assessed the sensitivity of femoral strain calculations to scaled-generic anthropometric errors. We obtained CT images of the pelves and femora of 10 healthy post-menopausal women and collected gait data from each participant during six weight-bearing tasks. Scaled-generic musculoskeletal models were generated using skin-mounted marker distances. Image-based models were created by modifying the scaled-generic models using muscle and joint parameters obtained from the CT data. Scaled-generic and image-based muscle and hip joint forces were determined by optimisation. A finite-element model of each femur was generated from the CT images, and both image-based and scaled-generic principal strains were computed in 32 regions throughout the femur. The intra-participant regional RMS error increased from 380 \u03bc\u03b5 (R2=0.92, p<0.001) to 4064 \u03bc\u03b5 (R2=0.48, p<0.001), representing 5.2% and 55.6% of the tensile yield strain in bone, respectively.

All hospitals must be prepared to care for patients with SARS. Thus, it is important to understand the transmission of this disease in hospitals and to evaluate methods for its containment in health care institutions. We describe how we cared for the first 2 patients with SARS admitted to our 419-bed community hospital in Richmond Hill, Ont., and the response to a SARS outbreak within our institution.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe collected clinical and epidemiological data about patients and health care workers at our institution who during a 13-day period had a potential unprotected exposure to 2 patients whose signs and symptoms were subsequently identified as meeting the case definition for probable SARS. The index case at our hospital was a patient who was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) from a referral hospital on Mar. 16, 2003, where he had been in close proximity to the son of the individual with the first reported case of SARS in Toronto. After 13 days in the ICU, a diagnosis of probable SARS was reached for our index case. Immediately upon diagnosis of our index case, respiratory isolation and barrier precautions were instituted throughout our hospital and maintained for a period of 10 days, which is the estimated maximum incubation period reported for this disease. Aggressive surveillance measures among hospital staff, patients and visitors were also maintained during this time.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the surveillance period, 15 individuals (10 hospital staff, 3 patients and 2 visitors) were identified as meeting the case definition for probable or suspected SARS, in addition to our index case. All but 1 individual had had direct contact with a symptomatic patient with SARS during the period of unprotected exposure. No additional cases were identified after infection control precautions had been implemented for 8 days. No cases of secondary transmission were identified in the 21 days following the implementation of these precautions at our institution.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nSARS can easily be spread by direct personal contact in the hospital setting. We found that the implementation of aggressive infection control measures is effective in preventing further transmission of this disease.", "citingTitle": "SARS: responding to an unknown virus", "citedTitle": "Identification and containment of an outbreak of SARS in a community hospital."}

Although an inhibitory GlyR tone is widely observed in the brain, it remains unknown whether this specifically reflects gliotransmission because most neurons also express VRACs and other endogenous molecules can activate GlyRs. We found that VRACs are absent in neurons of the rat supraoptic nucleus (SON), suggesting that glial cells are the exclusive source of taurine in this nucleus. Application of strychnine to rat hypothalamic explants caused a depolarization of SON neurons associated with a decrease of chloride conductance and could excite these cells in the absence of fast synaptic transmission. This inhibitory GlyR tone was eliminated by pharmacological blockade of VRACs, by cellular taurine depletion, by metabolic inactivation of glia with fluorocitrate, and after retraction of astrocytic processes that intercalate neuronal somata and dendrites. Finally, GlyR tone varied inversely with extracellular fluid tonicity to mediate the osmotic control of AP firing by SON neurons.

These results suggest differential biological mechanisms of estrogen deficiency in regulation of bone remodeling between OP and OA.IntroductionOP and OA are two common disorders in postmenopausal women. The inverse relationship has been suggested between OP and OA, but their mechanisms that relate to estrogen deficiency are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to compare the differential responsiveness to E2 of MSCs from osteoporotic versus osteoarthritic donors.MethodsTwenty postmenopausal patients, ten with osteoporotic hip fractures and ten with hip osteoarthritis, were included into this study. MSCs were derived from cancellous bones of femoral heads from OA and OP donors and cultured in osteogenic and adipogenic medium with or without E2 added. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium content, calcified nodules, lipid droplets, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of ALP, osteocalcin (OC), collagen 1\u03b1 (COL1\u03b1), peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor \u03b32 (PPAR\u03b32) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were measured and compared between two groups with OP and OA.ResultsIn osteogenic medium, ALP activity, calcium content and mRNA expression of OC and COL1\u03b1 in MSCs from OA were significantly higher than those from OP group. In adipogenic condition, there was no significant difference in lipid droplets formation and mRNA expression of PPAR\u03b32 and LPL between OP and OA groups.

MSCs of the proximal femur from OA and OP donors were cultured under control and different experimental mediums. After verifying the availability of primary cells, their osteogenic potential and responsiveness to leptin were compared between two groups. Similar patterns of cell growth were shown in both OA and OP groups. However, after the sixth passage, the viability of undifferentiated cells decreased more in OP than in OA donors. Under the same osteogenic supplements condition, the mRNA expression of osteogenesis\u2010specific genes, osteocalcin (OC) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were higher in OA group. Comparison of bone matrix mineralization was parallel to that of mRNA expression. The level of bone\u2010specific ALP (BAP) was higher in cells from donors with OA, whereas osteoprotegerin (OPG) was higher in OP group. This difference in BAP expression proved to be insignificant after the administration of leptin. Although leptin upregulated the expression of OPG, a significant difference still existed between OA and OP. In conclusion, differential osteogenic potential and responsiveness to leptin of MSCs were noted between postmenopausal women with OA and OP. Differential biological behavior of MSCs seems to be partly related to the different distribution of bone mass between OA and OP populations. \u00a9 2009 Orthopaedic Research Society.

For patients with chronic renal failure, severe dilated upper urinary tracts with deterioration of the renal function and those who are not able to perform a self-catheterization, the colonic conduit diversion is our therapy of choice. In this part of the study, we investigate the long-term safety of our concept for these patients in regard to protecting the upper urinary tracts. Between 1968 and 2002, colonic conduit urinary diversion was performed in 88 patients, in most of them in the era before continent diversion. Overall, 11 patients with a colonic conduit were converted to bladder substitution or continent cutaneous diversion during the follow-up period. These patients are no longer included in the long-term follow-up of colonic conduit patients. Of the 77 patients with colonic conduit diversion, 21 patients were not available for follow-up: 11 were deceased and 10 were lost to follow-up. Three of the deaths were related to nephrological complications in patients who already had impaired renal function before conduit diversion. An average follow-up of 21.8\u00a0years (2\u201332.7; median 23.8\u00a0years.) is available in 56 patients with 99 RUs (6 solitary kidneys, 7 nephrectomies). Five non-functioning kidneys were removed after recurrent pyelonephritis and two kidneys with pyonephrosis. Ureter stenoses were corrected in 6% of the RUs. As compared to preoperatively, the upper urinary tracts remained stable or improved in 97/99 RUs at the latest follow-up. A revision of the stoma was necessary in 16% (conduit elongation n =2, stenosis n =7) and calculi formations were treated in 8% of the RUs.

Of 144 renal units 76 per cent improved or remained stable and 69.3 per cent of normal kidneys remained normal after more than a decade of urinary diversion. In order to obtain these results close lifetime followup and aggressive loop revisions have been required. Urine cultures were consistently negative in 70.5 per cent of all patients. Good results were obtained in terms of preservation of renal function in all categories. Creatinine clearance remained in the normal range after 10 years if the excretory urogram remained normal. Ileal conduit urinary diversion remains a major surgical undertaking but it also remains the standard of urinary diversion against which all other methods must be judged. The results in terms of renal preservation are impressive but so too are the significant number of long-term complications.

To date, few data are available on longterm outcomes after this operation.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nBetween June 1998 and July 2004, a total of 52 patients underwent left trisectionectomy for primary or secondary hepatobiliary tumors at our institution. Data were analyzed with regard to patient characteristics, intraoperative details, pathologic findings, perioperative morbidity and mortality, and outcomes as determined by survival.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLeft trisectionectomy was combined with caudate lobectomy and hilar lymph node dissection in 29 and 35 patients, respectively. In addition, 43 procedures were performed in 31 patients: resection of hilar bifurcation (n = 15), bile-duct revision (n = 5), wedge resection of segment VI/VII (n = 10), gastrectomy (n = 1), and resection or reconstruction of hepatic vessels or the inferior vena cava (n = 12). Operative morbidity and mortality were 50% and 11.9%, respectively. By multivariate analysis, additional operative procedures constituted the only positive predictor of postoperative morbidity. One-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 65%, 52%, and 33%, respectively. After R0 resection (n = 37), 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 78%, 68%, and 44% compared with 38%, 15%, and 7% after R1 resection (p = 0.0004). Survival corresponding to the four most frequent tumor types (hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocellular carcinoma, hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and colorectal metastases) was comparable with survival data reported in the literature after less-extensive resections.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLeft trisectionectomy provides acceptable survival rates in both locally advanced primary hepatobiliary malignancies and large metastatic liver tumors. Despite major progress in surgical technique and perioperative management, left trisectionectomy is still associated with higher operative mortality and morbidity than less-extensive resections. Because selection criteria for this type of procedure are not clearly defined, particular attention should be focused on the oncologic benefits when considering this operation.", "citingTitle": "Laparoscopic extended liver resection: are postoperative outcomes different?", "citedTitle": "Left hepatic trisectionectomy for hepatobiliary malignancies."}

All downshifts caused a lag period of growth before growth resumed at a rate typical of the post-shift temperature. Lag and generation time increased with the magnitude of the shift or with the final temperature, while relative lag time displayed little variation across the test range. Analysis of time-dependent molecular changes revealed, in keeping with a decreased growth rate at lower temperature, repression of genes and proteins involved in DNA replication, protein synthesis and carbohydrate catabolism. Consistent with cold-induced remodelling of the bacterial cell envelope, alterations occurred in the expression of genes and proteins involved in transport and binding. The RpoS regulon exhibited sustained induction confirming its importance in adaptation and growth at 14\u00b0C. The RpoE regulon was transiently induced, indicating a potential role for this extracytoplasmic stress response system in the early phase of low temperature adaptation during lag phase. Interestingly, genes previously reported to be amongst the most highly up-regulated under oxidative stress were consistently down-regulated.

Gene and protein expression profiles of E. coli were more strongly affected by low water activity (aw 0.967) than by low temperature (14 \u00b0C). Predefined group enrichment analysis revealed that a universal response of E. coli to all test conditions included activation of the master stress response regulator RpoS and the Rcs phosphorelay system involved in the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide colanic acid, as well as down-regulation of elements involved in chemotaxis and motility. However, colanic acid-deficient mutants were shown to achieve comparable growth rates to their wild-type parents under all conditions, indicating that colanic acid is not required for growth.

Assessment of the external validity of stated preference studies, such as discrete-choice experiments (DCEs), remains an under-researched area.ObjectivesThe primary aim was to explore the preferences of All Wales Medicines Strategy Group (AWMSG) appraisal committee and appraisal sub-committee (the New Medicines Group) members (\u2018appraisal committees\u2019) for specific new medicines adoption criteria. Secondary aims were to explore the external validity of respondents\u2019 stated preferences and the impact of question choice options upon preference structures in DCEs.MethodsA DCE was conducted to estimate appraisal committees members\u2019 preferences for incremental cost effectiveness, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, annual number of patients expected to be treated, the impact of the disease on patients before treatment, and the assessment of uncertainty in the economic evidence submitted for new medicines compared with current UK NHS treatment. Respondents evaluated 28 pairs of hypothetical new medicines, making a primary forced choice between each pair and a more flexible secondary choice, which permitted either, neither or both new medicines to be chosen. The performance of the resultant models was compared against previous AWMSG decisions.ResultsForty-one out of a total of 80 past and present members of AWMSG appraisal committees completed the DCE. The incremental cost effectiveness of new medicines, and the QALY gains they provide, significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) influence recommendations. Committee members were willing to accept higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and lower QALY gains for medicines that treat disease impacting primarily upon survival rather than quality of life, and where uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness estimates has been thoroughly explored. The number of patients to be treated by the new medicine did not exert a significant influence upon recommendations. The use of a flexible-choice question format revealed a different preference structure to the forced-choice format, but the performance of the two models was similar. Aggregate decisions of the AWMSG were well predicted by both models, but their sensitivity (64\u00a0%, 68\u00a0%) and specificity (55\u00a0%, 64\u00a0%) were limited.ConclusionsA willingness to trade the cost effectiveness and QALY gains against other factors indicates that economic efficiency and QALY maximisation are not the only considerations of committee members when making recommendations on the use of medicines in Wales. On average, appraisal committee members\u2019 stated preferences appear consistent with their actual decision-making behaviours, providing support for the external validity of our DCEs. However, as health technology assessment involves complex decision-making processes, and each individual recommendation may be influenced to varying degrees by a multitude of different considerations, the ability of our models to predict individual medicine recommendations is more limited.", "citedAbstract": "The decisions made by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) give rise to two questions: how is cost-effectiveness evidence used to make judgements about the 'value for money' of health technologies?

Binary choice analysis is used to reveal the preferences of NICE and to consider the consistency of its decisions. For each decision to accept or reject a technology, explanatory variables include: the cost per life year or per QALY gained; uncertainty regarding cost effectiveness; the net cost to the NHS; the burden of disease; the availability (or not) of alternative treatments; and specific factors indicated by NICE. Results support the broad notion of a threshold, where the probability of rejection increases as the cost per QALY increases. Cost effectiveness, together with uncertainty and the burden of disease, explain NICE decisions better than cost effectiveness alone.

P7 transected cords showed labelling in the DC above the site of original transection indicating that neurites of this sensory tract were able to span the injury.

Among others, vasoactive peptides such as endothelin might play multifaceted roles in the different OM cells. Like their counterparts in the central nervous system, the olfactory sensory neurons are encompassed by different glial\u2010like non\u2010neuronal OM cells; sustentacular cells (SCs) surround their cell bodies, whereas olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) wrap their axons. Whereas SCs maintain both the structural and ionic integrity of the OM, OECs assure protection, local blood flow control and guiding of olfactory sensory neuron axons toward the olfactory bulb. We previously showed that these non\u2010neuronal OM cells are particularly responsive to endothelin in vitro. Here, we confirmed that the endothelin system is strongly expressed in the OM using in situ hybridization. We then further explored the effects of endothelin on SCs and OECs using electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging approaches on both in vitro and ex vivo OM preparations. Endothelin induced both robust calcium signals and gap junction uncoupling in both types of cells. This latter effect was mimicked by carbenoxolone, a known gap junction uncoupling agent.

Using two animal models, Caenorhabditis elegans and zebrafish embryos, we assessed the virulence of three E. coli ST131 strains (2 CTX-M-15- producing urine and 1 non-ESBL-producing faecal isolate), comparing them with five non-ST131 B2 and a group A uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC).

In zebrafish, the CTX-M-15-producing ST131 UPEC isolates were also less virulent than the non-ST131 B2 strains, suggesting that the production of CTX-M-15 is not correlated with enhanced virulence.

The histone chaperone Rtt106 has recently been shown to be present at these histone gene loci throughout the cell cycle in a HIR- and Asf1-dependent manner and involved in their transcriptional repression. The SWI/SNF and RSC chromatin remodeling complexes are both recruited to the HIR-dependent histone genes; SWI/SNF is required for their activation in S phase, whereas RSC is implicated in their repression outside of S phase. Even though their presence at the histone genes is dependent on the HIR complex, their specific recruitment has not been well characterized. In this study we focused on characterizing the role played by the histone chaperone Rtt106 in the cell cycle-dependent recruitment of SWI/SNF and RSC complexes to the histone genes. Methodology/Principal Findings Using GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that Rtt106 physically interacts with both the SWI/SNF and RSC complexes in vitro and in vivo. We then investigated the function of this interaction with respect to the recruitment of these complexes to HIR-dependent histone genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP), we found that Rtt106 is important for the recruitment of both SWI/SNF and RSC complexes to the HIR-dependent histone genes. Furthermore, using synchronized cell cultures, we showed by ChIP assays that the Rtt106-dependent SWI/SNF recruitment to these histone gene loci is cell cycle regulated and restricted to late G1 phase just before the peak of histone gene expression in S phase. Conclusions/Significance Overall, these data strongly suggest that the interaction between the histone chaperone Rtt106 and both the SWI/SNF and RSC chromatin remodeling complexes is important for the cell cycle regulated recruitment of these two complexes to the HIR-dependent histone genes.", "citedAbstract": "Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the evolutionarily conserved Swi/Snf complex acts at a subset of genes to help transcriptional activators function on chromatin templates.

Using antibody-based propionyl peptide enrichment followed by identification with nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that proteins were subject to lysine propionylation in all five bacterial species analyzed. Notably, many propionylations were identified in the Bacillus-related, thermophilic eubacterium G. kaustophilus, but fewer in the mesophilic eubacterium B. subtilis, suggesting that propionylation event abundance is independent of phylogenetic relationship. We further found propionylation sites in the thermophilic eubacterium T. thermophilus, but the thermophilic eubacterium R. marinus showed the fewest number of sites, indicating that growth temperature is not a determinant of propionylation state. In silico analyses demonstrated that lysine propionylation is related to metabolic pathways, particularly those controlled by acyl-CoA synthetases, similar to lysine acetylation.

Functional classification of the propionylproteins revealed that the number of propionylation sites in metabolic enzymes increased in late stationary phase, irrespective of protein abundance. The propionylation sites on proteins expressed in mid-exponential and late stationary phases partially overlapped.

The P-element insertion \u2009l(3)05007 occurs upstream of the transcription start site of the sugarless (sgl) gene and greatly reduces its transcription at various developmental stages. A single abundant sgl transcript shows a ubiquitous distribution and encodes a 53-kDa protein which is 64% identical in sequence to bovine UDP-glucose dehydrogenase. Overexpression of sgl in E. coli resulted in synthesis of a protein with high levels of UDPGDH activity. Expression of three genes that participate in pigment deposition, white, scarlet and brown, was significantly affected in populations segregating for sgl, suggesting that it is the decrease in UDPGDH level that produces the modifying effect observed. In addition, genetic effects on white-apricot were observed in sgl-wingless and sgl-hedgehog double mutants.

Here we describe the identification and characterization of Drosophila mutants in the suppenkasper (ska) gene. The ska gene encodes UDP-glucose dehydrogenase which produces glucuronic acid, an essential component for the synthesis of heparan and chondroitin sulfate. ska mutants fail to put heparan side chains on proteoglycans such as Syndecan. Surprisingly, mutant embryos produced by germ-line clones of this general metabolic gene exhibit embryonic cuticle phenotypes strikingly similar to those that result from loss-of-function mutations in genes of the Wingless (Wg) signaling pathway. Zygotic loss of ska leads to reduced growth of imaginal discs and pattern defects similar to wg mutants. In addition, genetic interactions of ska with wg and dishevelled mutants are observed.

To answer this question we used Cx43Cre\u2212ER(T)/fl mice, in which Cx43 expression is abolished after 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) administration. Isolated hearts from Cx43Cre\u2212ER(T)/fl mice, or from Cx43fl/fl controls, treated with vehicle or 4-OHT, were submitted to global ischemia (40\u00a0min) and reperfusion.

However, the ratio phosphorylated/total protein expression for Akt, ERK-1/2, GSK3\u03b2 and STAT3 was not increased in normoxic samples from animals lacking Cx43.

In contrast to the intensive investigation into the significance of kinase activation in cardioprotection, relatively little is known about the role of the phosphatases in this regard. The aim of this study was to re-evaluate the putative roles of PP1 and PP2A in ischaemia/reperfusion and in triggering ischaemic preconditioning. Isolated perfused working rat hearts were subjected to sustained global (15 or 20\u00a0min) or regional ischaemia (35\u00a0min), followed by reperfusion. Hearts were preconditioned using global ischaemia (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05 or 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0min, alternated with 5\u00a0min reperfusion). To inhibit both PP1 and PP2A cantharidin (5\u00a0\u03bcM) was used. To inhibit PP2A only, okadaic acid (7.5\u00a0nM) was used. The drugs were administered during the preconditioning protocol, before onset of sustained ischaemia (pretreatment) or during reperfusion. Endpoints were mechanical recovery during reperfusion, infarct size and activation of PKB/Akt, p38 MAPK and ERK p42/p44, as determined by Western blot. Pretreatment of hearts with okadaic acid or cantharidin caused a significant reduction in mechanical recovery after 15 or 20\u00a0min global ischaemia. Administration of the drugs during an ischaemic preconditioning protocol abolished functional recovery during reperfusion and significantly increased infarct size. Administration of the drugs during reperfusion had no deleterious effects and increased functional recovery in 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0PC hearts. To find an explanation for the differential effects of the inhibitors depending on the time of administration, hearts were freeze-clamped at different time points during the perfusion protocol. Administration of cantharidin before 5\u00a0min ischaemia activated all kinases. Subsequent reperfusion for 5\u00a0min without the drug maintained activation of the kinases until the onset of sustained ischaemia. Cantharidin given during preconditioning was associated with activation of p38MAPK and PKB/Akt during reperfusion after sustained ischaemia. However, administration of the drug during reperfusion only after sustained ischaemia caused activation of both PKB/Akt and ERK p42/p44. Phosphatase inhibition immediately prior to the onset of sustained ischaemia or during preconditioning abolishes protection during reperfusion, while inhibition of these enzymes during reperfusion either had no effect or enhanced the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. It is proposed that inhibition of phosphatases during reperfusion may prolong the period of RISK activation and hence protect the heart.", "citingTitle": "Activation of RISK and SAFE pathways is not involved in the effects of Cx43 deficiency on tolerance to ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury and preconditioning protection", "citedTitle": "Kinases and phosphatases in ischaemic preconditioning: a re-evaluation"}

Cell envelope proteinases (CEPs) are bacterial enzymes that hydrolyze milk proteins. In the case of L. helveticus, two CEPs with low percentages of amino acid identity have been described, i.e., PrtH and PrtH2. However, the distribution of the genes that encode CEPs still remains unclear, rendering it difficult to further control the formation of particular peptides. This study evaluated the diversity of genes that encode CEPs in a collection of strains of L. helveticus isolated from various biotopes, both in terms of the presence or absence of these genes and in terms of nucleotide sequence, and studied their transcription in dairy matrices. After defining three sets of primers for both the prtH and prtH2 genes, we studied the distribution of the genes by using PCR and Southern blotting experiments. The prtH2 gene was ubiquitous in the 29 strains of L. helveticus studied, whereas only 18 of them also exhibited the prtH gene. Sequencing of a 350-bp internal fragment of these genes revealed the existence of intraspecific diversity. Finally, expression of these two CEP-encoding genes was followed during the growth in dairy matrices of two strains, ITG LH77 and CNRZ32, which possess one and two CEP-encoding genes, respectively.

Amplification produces 100kb gradients of amplified DNA through repeated rounds of origin firing and bidirectional movement of replication forks from these origins. The Drosophila Follicle Cell Amplicon at the cytological location 62D, DAFC-62D, is uniquely regulated, with two separate rounds of amplification in developmental stages 10 and 13 of egg chamber development. We investigated mechanisms that control the unusual timing of DAFC-62D origin activation. We first defined origin sequences in DAFC-62D by analyzing the amount of nascent replicative DNA across this amplicon. Surprisingly, the origin coincides with the coding region of a gene named yellow-g2. ORC2 localizes to the origin, as well as two other sites that do not confer origin activity. Both ORC2 and MCM2-7 display differential association with these sequences, corresponding to the two rounds of amplification. All three elements, dispersed in a 7kb central amplified region, are required for either round of DAFC-62D amplification, because deleting any one completely abolished amplification in transposon experiments. Preceded by transcription yellow-g2 in stage 12, the late round of origin firing was ablated by the RNAPII inhibitor \u03b1-amanitin. This effect was absent from other amplicons and insulated transposons, and was stage-13 specific for amplification at either the endogenous DAFC-62D or heterologous transposons that did not have functional insulators. Therefore amplification at DAFC-62D in late follicle cell differentiation depends on transcription in cis. Molecularly, blocking RNAPII transcription compromises MCM2-7 recruitment. Additional transposon and histone modification analyses confirmed the involvement of RNAPII in amplification control, which may be facilitated by favorable chromatin structure.

It has been demonstrated for a wide variety of animals that males adapt to this situation behaviorally, physiologically and morphologically, e.g. by evolving relatively large testes size to produce more sperm. All pair-living primates investigated so far were found to have relatively small testes, suggesting a monandrous mating system. We investigated the relationship between extra-pair paternity (EPP) rate as a measure of sperm competition intensity and relative testes size in a pair-living primate, the fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer). Paternity exclusion analyses for seven offspring using six polymorphic DNA-microsatellite markers suggested a high EPP rate. Female nocturnal travel distances were longer during the mating season, suggesting that females take an active role in achieving extra-pair copulations (EPCs). Surprisingly, fork-marked lemur testes size was relatively small compared to 23 other lemuroid primates, a result that is in contrast to predictions of sperm competition theory. Neither possible behavioral and morphological adaptations to an alternative paternity guard (i.e. mate guarding), nor sampling biases, phylogenetic constraints, and population density effects explain the absence of large testes in a species with high EPP, a phenomenon also known from birds with moderate to low EPP rates. We conclude that more data are needed on the frequency of EPCs, the timing of in-pair and extra-pair copulations, as well as the role of female choice, to explain why males of some species apparently do not adapt to sperm competition.", "citedAbstract": "Abstract The primates of Madagascar (Lemuriformes) deviate from fundamental predictions of sexual selection theory in that polygynous species lack sexual dimorphism, have even adult sex ratios and often live in female-dominated societies. It has been hypothesized that intrasexual selection in these species is either reduced or primarily focused on traits related to scramble competition. The goal of this study was to examine these hypotheses by studying the mating system of a solitary nocturnal species, Mirzacoquereli. During a 4-year field study in western Madagascar, I captured and followed 88 individually marked animals. I found that adult males were significantly larger than females, providing the first evidence for sexual size dimorphism in lemurs. In addition, the adult sex ratio was biased in favour of females in 3 out of 4 years. There was no significant sex difference in canine size, however. Males showed pronounced seasonal variation in testis size with a 5-fold increase before and during the short annual mating season. During the mating season, males had more injuries than females and more than quadrupled their home ranges, overlapping with those of more than ten females, but also with about the same number of rivals. Only about one social interaction per 10\u2009h of observation was recorded, but none of them were matings. Together, these results indicate that these solitary lemurs are clearly subject to intrasexual selection and that male-male competition is primarily, but not exclusively, of the scramble type. In addition, they suggest that the above-mentioned idiosyncracies may be limited to group-living lemurs, that social systems of solitary primates are more diverse than previously thought, and that the temporal distribution of receptive females is responsible for this particular male mating strategy.", "citingTitle": "Small testes size despite high extra-pair paternity in the pair-living nocturnal primate Phaner furcifer", "citedTitle": "Intrasexual selection in Mirza coquereli : evidence for scramble competition polygyny in a solitary primate"}

Azospirillum is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium living in the rhizosphere of many important crops.

We gained further insight into HyHK structure and architecture, revealing an intriguing complexity of these systems. An unusual proportion of TCS genes were orphaned or in complex clusters, and a high proportion of predicted soluble HKs compared to other plant-associated bacteria are reported.

Recent studies have shown that during development, neural tissues produce mRNAs with particularly long 3\u2032UTRs, suggesting that such extensions might be important for neural development and function. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying neural APA are not well understood. Here, we investigate this problem within the Drosophila nervous system, focusing on the roles played by general cleavage and polyadenylation factors (CPA factors). In particular, we examine the model that modulations in CPA factor concentration may affect APA during development. For this, we first analyse the expression of the Drosophila orthologues of all mammalian CPA factors and note that their expression decreases during embryogenesis. In contrast to this global developmental decrease in CPA factor expression, we see that cleavage factor I (CFI) expression is actually elevated in the late embryonic central nervous system, suggesting that CFI might play a special role in neural tissues. To test this, we use the UAS/Gal4 system to deplete CFI proteins from neural tissue and observe that in this condition, multiple genes switch their APA patterns, demonstrating a role of CFI in APA control during Drosophila neural development. Furthermore, analysis of genes with 3\u2032UTR extensions of different length leads us to suggest a novel relation between 3\u2032UTR length and sensitivity to CPA factor expression.

Comparison to previous low-temperature FTIR spectra of hR intermediates confirms that characteristic hK and hL spectral features are both present before the tau(1) decay, in a state previously defined as hK(L) (Dioumaev, A., and M. Braiman. 1997. Photochem. Photobiol. 66:755-763). However, the relative sizes of these features depend on which halide is present. In Br-, the hL features are clearly more dominant than in Cl-.

Different halides affect the relative amounts of hK(L) and hL(1) present, i.e., Cl- produces a much more significant back-reaction from hL(1) to hK(L) than does Br-.

The time evolution of these difference bands indicate that both the T1 and T2 decay processes involve principally a relaxation of the chromophore and its immediate environment. The decay of the intense HOOP vibrations is nearly equally divided between the T1 and T2 processes, indicating a complex chromophore relaxation from a twisted nonrelaxed conformation in the primary (hKE) bathointermediate, to a less\u2010twisted structure in hKL, and finally to a roughly planar structure in the hypsochromically shifted hL intermediate. This conclusion is also supported by the unexpectedly large positive entropy of activation observed for the T1 process.

It was proposed that block involved an electrostatic interaction between neomycin and putative regions of negative charge in both the cytosolic and luminal mouths of the pore. In this study, we have attempted to screen charge by increasing potassium concentration in single-channel experiments. Neomycin block is apparent at both cytosolic and luminal faces of the channel in all K+ concentrations tested and alterations in K+ concentration have no effect on the amplitudes of the neomycin-induced substates. However, the kinetics of both cytosolic and luminal block are sensitive to changes in K+ concentration. In both cases increasing the K+ concentration leads to an increase in dissociation constant (KD). Underlying these changes are marked increases in rates of dissociation (k(off)), with little change in rates of association (k(on)). The increase in k(off) is more marked at the luminal face of the channel. Changes in K+ concentration also result in alterations in the voltage dependence of block. We have interpreted these data as supporting the proposal that neomycin block of RyR2 involves electrostatic interactions with the polycation forming a poorly fitting \"plug\" in the mouths of the conduction pathway.

CTX blocks K+ conduction by binding to the external side of the channel, with an apparent dissociation constant of approximately 10 nM at physiological ionic strength. The dwell-time distributions of both blocked and unblocked states are single-exponential. The toxin association rate varies linearly with the CTX concentration, and the dissociation rate is independent of it. CTX is competent to block both open and closed channels; the association rate is sevenfold faster for the open channel, while the dissociation rate is the same for both channel conformations. Membrane depolarization enhances the CTX dissociation rate e-fold/28 mV; if the channel's open probability is maintained constant as voltage varies, then the toxin association rate is voltage independent. Increasing the external solution ionic strength from 20 to 300 mM (with K+, Na+, or arginine+) reduces the association rate by two orders of magnitude, with little effect on the dissociation rate. We conclude that CTX binding to the Ca2+-activated K+ channel is a bimolecular process, and that the CTX interaction senses both voltage and the channel's conformational state.

The BAF (SWI/SNF) complex is essential for development, and has been demonstrated to remodel reconstituted chromatin in vitro and to control the accessibility of a few individual regions in vivo. However, it remains unclear where and how BAF controls the open chromatin landscape to regulate developmental processes, such as human epidermal differentiation.ResultsUsing a novel \u201con-plate\u201d ATAC-sequencing approach for profiling open chromatin landscapes with a low number of adherent cells, we demonstrate that the BAF complex is essential for maintaining 11.6\u00a0% of open chromatin regions in epidermal differentiation. These BAF-dependent open chromatin regions are highly cell-type-specific and are strongly enriched for binding sites for p63, a master epidermal transcription factor. The DNA sequences of p63 binding sites intrinsically favor nucleosome formation and are inaccessible in other cell types without p63 to prevent ectopic activation. In epidermal cells, BAF and p63 mutually recruit each other to maintain 14,853 open chromatin regions. We further demonstrate that BAF and p63 cooperatively position nucleosomes away from p63 binding sites and recruit transcriptional machinery to control tissue differentiation.ConclusionsBAF displays high specificity in controlling the open chromatin landscape during epidermal differentiation by cooperating with the master transcription factor p63 to maintain lineage-specific open chromatin regions.", "citedAbstract": "CHROMATIN structure can affect the transcriptional activity of eukaryotic structural genes by blocking access of sequence-specific activator proteins (activators) to their promoter-binding sites1.

The way in which activators bind to nucleosomal DNA is therefore a critical aspect of transcriptional activation. Genetic studies have suggested that the multi-component SWI/SNF complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae facilitates transcription by altering the structure of the chromatin4,5. Here we identify and partially purify a human homologue of the yeast SWI/SNF complex (hSWI/SNF complex).

It was only on the fifth day of regeneration that the mRNA of the neonatal variant of the fast-twitch skeletal SERCA1b isoform began to rise, well before the other SERCA transcripts. At 7 and 10 days, i.e. at a time when the new myofibres normally become reinnervated, the mRNA level of SERCA1a and SERCA2a increased markedly, but the fast-twitch skeletal SERCA1a isoform was still the most prominent. On day 21, in the advanced stage of regeneration, a switch in the relative expression levels of SERCA1a and SERCA2a mRNA was observed and the ratio of both isoforms became similar to that found in the normal soleus muscles. This was followed by a decline in the level of all SERCA mRNA species, so that on day 28 the levels of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmatic-reticulum Ca(2+)-pump RNAs was again lower but their ratio remained similar to that of the untreated control soleus.", "citingTitle": "The neonatal sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase gives a clue to development and pathology in human muscles", "citedTitle": "Changes in mRNA levels of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic-reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase isoforms in the rat soleus muscle regenerating from notexin-induced necrosis."}

This pathogenic organism has been associated with rare form of infant meningitis and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) with high mortality rate (40-80%). Some cases have been linked to the consumption of contaminated powdered infant formula milk (PIF). The objective of this study was to determine the presence of Cronobacter spp. in PIF sold in Malaysia. A selective chromogenic agar, Brilliance Enterobacter sakazakii (DFI, Oxoid), was used for detection of Cronobacter strains. Presumptive Cronobacter isolates were identified using biochemical tests (API 20E and Microgen TM ) and molecular assays (SYBR Green Real-time PCR and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing). All presumptive Cronobacter strains produced typical blue-green colonies and non-Cronobacter strains produced yellow colonies on Brilliance Enterobacter sakazakii agar (DFI formulation). A total of 12 presumptive isolates were selected from DFI agar and identified with biochemical and molecular tests. The results indicated prevalence of 12.5% C. sakazakii contamination from 72 PIF samples.

Recent taxonomic analyses have determined that E. sakazakii comprises a number of genomospecies, and it has been proposed that E. sakazakii be reclassified as a novel genus, \"Cronobacter\". Accurate methods are required for the rapid detection and identification of this group of micro-organisms, since even low cell numbers have been reported to cause disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate various E. sakazakii detection methods in order to ascertain the most suitable method for detection and identification of these pathogenic agents. Samples from IFM and the environment were evaluated for the presence of E. sakazakii using the isolation steps (pre-enrichment, enrichment and selection) described in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) method for E. sakazakii detection. Sixty-four isolates (50 from IFM and 14 from the environment) were selected from tryptone soy agar (TSA), regardless of colony appearance, and these isolates were identified by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing. Thereafter, different culture-dependent and culture-independent methods were evaluated to accurately detect and identify the E. sakazakii isolates. These methods included the assessment of yellow pigment production on TSA, typical colonies on chromogenic Druggan-Forsythe-Iversen (DFI) and Chromocult Enterobacter sakazakii (CES) media and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using six different species-specific primer pairs described in the literature. Identification of E. sakazakii using yellow pigment production was demonstrated to have a low sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (87%, 71% and 74%, respectively), which lowers the suitability of the FDA method. Chromogenic DFI and CES media were sensitive, specific and accurate (100%, 98% and 98%, respectively) for the detection of E. sakazakii. The specificity of the PCR amplifications ranged from 8% to 92%, emphasising the need for rigorous primer testing against closely related species. Of the primer pairs evaluated, Esakf/Esakr were the most suitable for E. sakazakii detection and identification. The detection limit of Esakf/Esakr was found to be 10(4) CFU/ml. This study demonstrated that no single method was capable of unambiguously confirming the presence and identity of E. sakazakii isolates, that each method had inherent advantages and disadvantages, and that in most cases several methods were required for accurate detection and identification. Further, it was demonstrated that the current FDA method for E. sakazakii detection should be revised in the light of the availability of more sensitive, specific and accurate detection methods.", "citingTitle": "Incidence of cronobacter sakazakii in powdered infant formula milk available in Malaysia", "citedTitle": "Evaluation of different methods for the detection and identification of Enterobacter sakazakii isolated from South African infant formula milks and the processing environment."}

In this paper, we look at this fundamental challenge through the lens of design science, which is an approach aimed primarily at discovery and problem-solving as opposed to accumulation of theoretical knowledge. We explore in particular the ways in which problem-solving research and theory-oriented academic research can complement one another. In operations management (OM) research, recognizing and building on this complementarity is especially crucial, because problem-solving-oriented research produces the very artifacts (e.g., technologies) that empirical OM research subsequently evaluates in an attempt to build explanatory theory. It is indeed the practitioner - not the academic scientist - who engages in basic research in OM.

Previous ultrahigh-pressure experiments, however, have been performed on simple systems such as SiO2 or MgSiO3, and experiments in more complex system have been conducted under relatively low-pressure conditions below 60\u00a0GPa. The effect of other metal cations on structural changes that occur in dense silicate glasses under ultrahigh pressures has been poorly understood. Here, we used a Brillouin scattering spectroscopic method up to pressures of 196.9\u00a0GPa to conduct in situ high-pressure acoustic wave velocity measurements of SiO2-Al2O3 glasses in order to understand the effect of Al2O3 on pressure-induced structural changes in the glasses as analogs of aluminosilicate melts. From 10 to 40\u00a0GPa, the transverse acoustic wave velocity (VS) of Al2O3-rich glass (SiO2\u2009+\u200920.5\u00a0mol% Al2O3) was greater than that of Al2O3-poor glass (SiO2\u2009+\u20093.9\u00a0mol% Al2O3). This result suggests that SiO2-Al2O3 glasses with higher proportions of Al ions with large oxygen coordination numbers (5 and 6) become elastically stiffer up to 40\u00a0GPa, depending on the Al2O3 content, but then soften above 40\u00a0GPa. At pressures from 40 to ~100\u00a0GPa, the increase in VS with increasing pressure became less steep than below 40\u00a0GPa. Above ~100\u00a0GPa, there were abrupt increases in the P-VS gradients (dVS/dP) at 130\u00a0GPa in Al2O3-poor glass and at 116\u00a0GPa in Al2O3-rich glass. These changes resemble previous experimental results on SiO2 glass and MgSiO3 glass. Given that changes of dVS/dP have commonly been related to changes in the Si-O coordination states in the glasses, our results, therefore, may indicate a drastic structural transformation in SiO2-Al2O3 glasses above 116\u00a0GPa, possibly associated with an average Si-O coordination number change to higher than 6. Compared to previous acoustic wave velocity data on SiO2 and MgSiO3 glasses, Al2O3 appears to promote a lowering of the pressure at which the abrupt increase of dVS/dP is observed. This suggests that the Al2O3 in silicate melts may help to stabilize those melts gravitationally in the lower mantle.", "citedAbstract": "Acoustic wave velocities of SiO2 glass were measured up to pressures of 207 GPa using newly developed Brillouin scattering spectroscopic techniques to address the nature of pressure-induced structural changes. The acoustic wave velocity data suggests three distinct pressure regimes, two of which correspond to changes in the Si-O coordination number with pressure, and one of which indicates the stability of sixfold-coordinated Si over a broad pressure interval from approximately 40-140 GPa. An anomalous increase in the effect of pressure on velocity at 140 GPa most likely corresponds to the onset of structural densification associated with an increase in coordination number from sixfold to a higher coordination state.", "citingTitle": "Ultrahigh-pressure acoustic wave velocities of SiO2-Al2O3 glasses up to 200\u00a0GPa", "citedTitle": "Spectroscopic evidence for ultrahigh-pressure polymorphism in SiO2 glass."}

It is largely adopted in disciplines outside software engineering, including different areas of computer science. Ethnography can provide an in-depth understanding of the socio-technological realities surrounding everyday software development practice, i.e., it can help to uncover not only what practitioners do, but also why they do it. Despite its potential, ethnography has not been widely adopted by empirical software engineering researchers, and receives little attention in the related literature. The main goal of this paper is to explain how empirical software engineering researchers would benefit from adopting ethnography. This is achieved by explicating four roles that ethnography can play in furthering the goals of empirical software engineering: to strengthen investigations into the social and human aspects of software engineering; to inform the design of software engineering tools; to improve method and process development; and to inform research programmes. This article introduces ethnography, explains its origin, context, strengths and weaknesses, and presents a set of dimensions that position ethnography as a useful and usable approach to empirical software engineering research.

We address a problem often neglected in macro-ecological studies on species distribution: scale-dependency of distribution models. The models are based on empirical field data and on environmental databases for large-scale models. The implementation of several statistical modelling approaches, external validation strategies and the implementation of a recent study on regional climate change in Switzerland ensure robust predictions of future range shifts. Our results demonstrate that, on the territory level, variables depicting vegetation, heterogeneity of local topography and habitat structure have greatest explanatory power. In contrast at the meso-scale and macro-scale (with grain sizes of 1 and 100\u00a0km2, respectively), bioclimatic and land cover-related variables play a prominent role. The models predict that, based on increasing temperatures during the breeding season, potential habitat will decrease by up to two-thirds until the year 2070. At the same time, a shift of potential habitat towards the mountain tops is predicted. The multi-scale approach highlights the true extent of potential habitat for this species with its patchy distribution in steep terrain. The small-scale analysis pinpoints the key habitat areas within the extensive areas of suitable habitat predicted by models on large grain sizes and in this way reveals sub-grid variability.

Ein mehrskaliger Ansatz.\n Fortlaufendes Monitoring hat gezeigt, dass innerhalb des letzten Jahrzehnts die Population des Alpenschneehuhns (Lagopus muta helvetica) in den Schweizer Alpen stark abgenommen hat. Als m\u00f6gliche Ursache kommt der Klimawandel in Betracht. In dieser Studie untersuchen wir die Auswirkungen raschen Klimawandels auf dieses hochalpine Raufu\u00dfhuhn. Dabei setzten wir uns mit einem Aspekt auseinander, der in vielen makro\u00f6kologischen Studien oft vernachl\u00e4ssigt wird: die Skalenabh\u00e4ngigkeit von Habitatmodellen.

Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species\u2019 response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. \u00a9 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

We aimed to target states related to anxiety levels and general well-being, in addition to long-term and working memory processes, using monaural beats within the range of main cortical rhythms. Theta (6 Hz), alpha (10 Hz) and gamma (40 Hz) beat frequencies, as well as a control stimulus were applied to healthy participants for 5 min. After each stimulation period, participants were asked to evaluate their current mood state and to perform cognitive tasks examining long-term and working memory processes, in addition to a vigilance task. Monaural beat stimulation was found to reduce state anxiety.

This study compared the effects of binaural auditory beats in the EEG beta and EEG theta/delta frequency ranges on mood and on performance of a vigilance task to investigate their effects on subjective and objective measures of arousal. Participants (n = 29) performed a 30-min visual vigilance task on three different days while listening to pink noise containing simple tones or binaural beats either in the beta range (16 and 24 Hz) or the theta/delta range (1.5 and 4 Hz). However, participants were kept blind to the presence of binaural beats to control expectation effects. Presentation of beta-frequency binaural beats yielded more correct target detections and fewer false alarms than presentation of theta/delta frequency binaural beats.

The variables important in discrimination from the CONCA thus enabled the recognition of different metabolic patterns encapsulated within the data sets that would not have been revealed by using only one mode of scaling. Application of multivariate and univariate analyses disclosed 11 important metabolites that distinguished untreated IVA from controls. These included well-established diagnostic biomarkers of IVA, endogenous detoxification markers, and 3-hydroxycaproic acid, an indicator of ketosis, but not reported previously for this disease. Nine metabolites were identified that reflected the effect of treatment of IVA. They included detoxification products and indicators related to the high carbohydrate and low protein diet which formed the hallmark of the treatment. This investigation also provides the first comparative metabolite profile for heterozygotes of this inherited metabolic disorder. The detection of informative metabolites in even very low concentrations in all three experimental groups highlights the potential advantage of the holistic mode of analysis of inherited metabolic diseases in a metabolomics investigation.", "citedAbstract": "Isovaleric acidemia (IVA) is one of the most common organic acidemias found in South Africa. Since 1983, a significant number of IVA cases have been identified in approximately 20,000 Caucasian patients screened for metabolic defects. IVA is caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD) resulting in the accumulation of isovaleryl-CoA and its metabolites. In total, 10 IVA patients and three carriers were available for phenotypic and genotypic investigation in this study. All patients were found to be homozygous for a single c.367\u00a0G > A (p.G123R) mutation. The amino acid substitution of a glycine to arginine resulted in a markedly reduced steady-state level of the IVD protein, which explains the nearly complete lack of IVD enzyme activity as assessed in fibroblast homogenates. Despite the genetic homogeneity of this South African IVA group, the clinical presentation varied widely, ranging from severe mental handicap and multiple episodes of metabolic derangement to an asymptomatic state. The variation may be due to poor dietary intervention, delayed diagnosis or even epigenetic and polygenetic factors of unknown origin.", "citingTitle": "Organic acid profile of isovaleric acidemia: a comprehensive metabolomics approach", "citedTitle": "Clinical variability of isovaleric acidemia in a genetically homogeneous population"}

Nitrogen availability is one of the main factors limiting mangrove growth. Diazotrophs have been identified as key organisms that provide nitrogen to these environments. N2-fixation by such organisms was found to be higher in the mangrove roots than in surrounding rhizosphere. Moreover, previous studies showed that mangroves grew better in the presence of N2-fixers indicating a potentially mutualistic relationship. However, the molecular signals and mechanisms that govern these interactions are still poorly understood. Here we present novel insights in the interaction of a diazotroph with a mangrove species to improve our understanding of the molecular and ecophysiological relationship between these two organisms under controlled conditions. Our results showed that Marinobacterium mangrovicola is a versatile organism capable of competing with other organisms to survive for long periods in mangrove soils. N2-fixation by this bacterium was up-regulated in the presence of mangrove roots, indicating a possible beneficial interaction. The increase in N2-fixation was limited to cells of the exponential growth phase suggesting that N2-fixation differs over the bacterial growth cycle. Bacterial transformants harboring a transcriptional nifH::gusA fusion showed that M. mangrovicola successfully colonized mangrove roots and simultaneously conducted N2-fixation. The colonization process was stimulated by the lack of an external carbon source suggesting a possible mutualistic relationship. M. mangrovicola represents an interesting genetically accessible diazotroph, which colonize mangrove roots and exhibit higher N2-fixation in the presence of mangrove roots. Consequently, we propose this microorganism as a tool to study molecular interactions between N2-fixers and mangrove plants and to better understand how changes in the environment could impact these important and relatively unknown interactions.", "citedAbstract": "Trichodesmium spp. have proved to be enigmatic organisms, and their ecology and physiology are unusual among diazotrophs. Recent research shows that they can simultaneously fix N2 and take up combined nitrogen. The co-occurrence of these two processes is thought to be incompatible, but they could be obligatory in Trichodesmium spp. if only a small fraction of cells within a colony or along a filament are capable of N2 fixation. Combined nitrogen is released from cells during periods of active growth and N2 fixation, and concomitantly taken up by Trichodesmium spp. or cells living in association with colonies. Although the nitrogenase of Trichodesmium spp. is affected by high concentrations of combined nitrogen, it might be relatively less sensitive to low concentrations of combined nitrogen typical of the oligotrophic ocean and culture conditions. Nitrogenase activity and synthesis exhibits an endogenous rhythm in Trichodesmium spp. cultures, which is affected by the addition of nitrogen.", "citingTitle": "Bacterial N2-fixation in mangrove ecosystems: insights from a diazotroph\u2013mangrove interaction", "citedTitle": "The nitrogen physiology of the marine N2-fixing cyanobacteria Trichodesmium spp."}

P. boliviensis venom and RP-HPLC fractions showed hemolytic activity and hydrolyzed the synthetic substrate 4-nitro-3-octanoyloxy-benzoic acid, indicating the presence of phospholipases A2 enzymes. The electrophoretic profile showed an important protein content with molecular masses below 14 kDa, and differences between male and female protein content were also revealed. The RP-HPLC venom profile exposes differences between males and female content consistent with the electrophoretic profile. Five fractions collected from the RP-HPLC displayed significant larvicidal activity. Mass analysis indicates the presence of peptides ranging from 1047.71 to 3278.07 Da.

Also, this fraction contains a class of peptides that are able to inhibit glutamate uptake in preparations of mammalian central nervous systems (CNS). In this work a new toxin called PnTx4-3 was isolated from the PhTx4 fraction by reverse phase and anion exchange steps using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Edman sequencing of PnTx4-3 revealed that it was a polypeptide of 48 amino acid residues, containing 10 cysteines cross-linked by five disulfide bridges. The molecular mass measured by ES-Q-TOF mass spectrometry was 5199.49+/-0.64 Da, which is very close to the calculated mass from amino acid sequence (5199.99 Da). This toxin induces immediate excitatory effects when injected intrathoracically in house flies and cockroaches. Intracerebroventricular injections of 30 microg of PnTx4-3 in mice resulted in no apparent signs of intoxication. In order to make an orthologous comparison, pharmacological characterisation were carried out in rat brain synaptosomes by using [3H]-L-glutamate, showed that the whole PhTx4 fraction as well as the pure toxins PnTx4-3, Tx4(6-1) and Tx4(5-5) obtained of this fraction, were able to inhibit the glutamate uptake in the micromolar concentration range. PnTx4-3 inhibits the glutamate uptake in a dose dependent manner, with an IC50 of approximately 1 microM.
