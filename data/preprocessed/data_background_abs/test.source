chapel is a parallel programming language designed to improve the productivity and ease of use of conventional and parallel computers. this language currently delivers sub optimal performance when executing codes that perform global data re-allocation operations on distributed memory architectures. this is mainly due to data communication that is done without aggregation (one message for each remote array element). in this work, we analyze chapel's standard block and cyclic distribution modules and optimize the communication routines for array assignments by performing aggregation. thanks to the expressive power of chapel, the compiler and runtime have enough information to do communication aggregation without user intervention. the runtime relies on the low-level gas net networking layer, whose versions of one-sided bulk put/get routines that support strides are particularly useful for us. experimental results conducted on hector (a cray xe6) and jaguar (cray xk6)reveal that the implemented techniques can lead to significant reductions in communication time. the next generations of supercomputers are projected to have hundreds of thousands of processors. however, as the numbers of processors grow, the scalability of applications will be the dominant challenge. this forces us to reexamine some of our fundamental ways that we approach the design and use of parallel languages and runtime systems. in this paper we show how the globally shared arrays in a popular partitioned global address space (pgas) language, unified parallel c (upc), can be combined with a new collective interface to improve both performance and scalability. this interface allows subsets, or teams, of threads to perform a collective together. as opposed to mpi's communicators, our interface allows set of threads to be placed in teams instantly rather than explicitly constructing communicators, thus allowing for a more dynamic team construction and manipulation. we motivate our ideas with three application kernels: dense matrix multiplication, dense cholesky factorization and multidimensional fourier transforms. we describe how the three aforementioned applications can be succinctly written in upc thereby aiding productivity. we also show how such an interface allows for scalability by running on up to 16,384 processors on the blue-gene/l. in a few lines of upc code, we wrote a dense matrix multiply routine achieves 28.8 tflop/s and a 3d fft that achieves 2.1 tflop/s. we analyze our performance results through models and show that the machine resources rather than the interfaces themselves limit the performance.
abstractbackground total gastrectomy has detrimental effects on postoperative nutritional status and quality of life (qol), but it is often unavoidable in the treatment of gastric cancer. roux-en-y (ry) is the most common reconstruction method following total gastrectomy. trials to explore other means of reconstruction have been conducted but have failed to identify a method that is globally accepted.methodsaboral pouch reconstruction (ap), in which an anisoperistaltic jejunal pouch is created in the y limb of the ry reconstruction, is considered effective and technically feasible. a prospective randomized trial was conducted to compare ap with ry. gastric cancer patients requiring total gastrectomy for r0 resection were randomly assigned during surgery to receive either ry (n = 51) or ap (n = 49). postoperative qol as assessed by the eortc qlq-c30 and sto22, body composition, and morbidity were compared between the two reconstruction methods. the physical functioning score of the qlq-c30 was selected as the primary endpoint.resultsthe incidences of postoperative complications were similar between the two groups (29 % in the ry group and 27 % in the ap group). no significant difference was observed in the physical functioning score, and the superiority of ap was demonstrated only for the nausea and vomiting score at 12 months (p = 0.041) and the reflux score at 1 month (p = 0.036). no significant differences were observed in body composition or serum biochemistry.conclusionsalthough ap was safely implemented, no increased benefits in nutritional or qol-related parameters were observed for this method over ry within 12 months postoperatively. quality of life is an important outcome measure in the care of patients with cancer. we developed a new scoring system specifically for the evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction. this study was undertaken to evaluate the scoring system’s validity in comparing outcomes after gastric resection. patients with gastric cancer, 3 months to 3 years postoperatively, were surveyed using the survey instrument. postoperative dysfunction scores and the status of resuming activities of daily living were compared with the surgical procedure performed by analysis of variance and multiple-comparison techniques. of 211 patients surveyed, 165 (119 men, 46 women; mean age, 65.1 ± 10.5 years) responded. procedures included distal gastrectomy in 100, total gastrectomy in 57, and pylorus-preserving gastrectomy in 8. the overall dysfunction score was 61.8 ± 15.5. the dysfunction score was 58.9 ± 15.0 after distal gastrectomy, 66.8 ± 14.1 after total gastrectomy, and 62.4 ± 21.6 after pylorus-preserving gastrectomy. these values differed significantly among the groups (p = .007). dysfunction scores according to postoperative activity status were 49.1 ± 15.6 in 71 patients who resumed their activities, 56.9 ± 15.7 in 39 patients with reduced activities, 57.3 ± 8.8 in 15 patients with minimal activities, and 63.3 ± 11.8 (p < .05) in 16 patients who did not resume activities because of poor physical condition. this scoring system for postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction provides an objective measure of dysfunction related to specific surgical procedures and correlates with activities of daily living in the postoperative period.
abstract we describe here a cell line-based assay for the evaluation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) neutralization. the assay is based on cem.nkr cells, transfected to express the hiv-1 coreceptor ccr5 to supplement the endogenous expression of cd4 and the cxcr4 coreceptor. the resulting cem.nkr-ccr5 cells efficiently replicate primary hiv-1 isolates of both r5 and x4 phenotypes. a comparison of the cem.nkr-ccr5 cells with mitogen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) in neutralization assays with sera from hiv-1-infected individuals or specific anti-hiv-1 monoclonal antibodies shows that the sensitivity of hiv-1 neutralization is similar in the two cell types. the cem.nkr-ccr5 cell assay, however, is more convenient to perform and eliminates the donor-to-donor variation in hiv-1 replication efficiency, which is one of the principal drawbacks of the pbmc-based neutralization assay. we suggest that this new assay is suitable for the general measurement of hiv-1 neutralization by antibodies. abstract we have investigated whether the identity of the coreceptor (ccr5, cxcr4, or both) used by primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) isolates to enter cd4+ cells influences the sensitivity of these isolates to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and cd4-based agents. coreceptor usage was not an important determinant of neutralization titer for primary isolates in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. we also studied whether dualtropic primary isolates (able to use both ccr5 and cxcr4) were differentially sensitive to neutralization by the same antibodies when entering u87mg-cd4 cells stably expressing either ccr5 or cxcr4. again, we found that the coreceptor used by a virus did not greatly affect its neutralization sensitivity. similar results were obtained for ccr5- or cxcr4-expressing hos cell lines engineered to express green fluorescent protein as a reporter of hiv-1 entry. neutralizing antibodies are therefore unlikely to be the major selection pressure which drives the phenotypic evolution (change in coreceptor usage) of hiv-1 that can occur in vivo. in addition, the increase in neutralization sensitivity found when primary isolates adapt to growth in transformed cell lines in vitro has little to do with alterations in coreceptor usage.
the lis1-encoded protein (lis1) plays a role in brain development because a hemizygous deletion or mutation of the human gene causes neuronal migration disorders, such as miller-dieker syndrome (mds) or isolated lissencephaly sequence (ils). using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have isolated a novel protein that interacts with mouse lis1 (mlis1) which is termed mouse nude-like protein (mnude-l) because of its 49% amino acid conservation with nude, a protein involved in nuclear migration in aspergillus nidulans. gst pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation of fusion proteins expressed in mammalian cells confirmed the interaction of mlis1 and mnude-l. mnude-l gives rise to a approximately 2.3 kb mrna and encodes an orf corresponding to approximately 38 kda protein. the overall amino acid sequence of mnude-l is 49-95% identical to proteins found in a variety of organisms, thus establishing mnude-l as a new member of a protein family. the hallmark of this family is an n-terminal region predicted to form a coiled-coil domain. we show that mnude-l and mlis1 are coexpressed in the postnatal and adult cerebral cortices and in the purkinje neurons of the cerebellum. in contrast to mlis1, mnude-l transcripts are absent in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb and in the inward migrating granular neurons of the developing cerebellum. mutant mlis1 proteins modelling mutations found in human lissencephaly patients fail to interact with mnude-l, raising the possibility that phenotypic changes result, in part, from the inability of mutant lis1 proteins to interact with the human nude-l polypeptide. lis1 is a product of the causative gene for type i lissencephaly characterized by a smooth brain surface due to a defect in neuronal migration during brain development and a regulatory subunit of platelet‐activating factor acetylhydrolase (paf‐ah). it is also a mammalian homologue of the fungal nuclear distribution (nud) gene, nudf, which controls the migration of fungal nuclei. using the two‐hybrid system, we identified a novel lis1‐interacting protein, rat nude (rnude), and found that it is a mammalian homologue of another fungal nud gene product, nude, and xenopus mitotic phosphoprotein 43 which is phosphorylated in a cell cycle‐dependent manner. rnude and the catalytic subunits of paf‐ah interact with the n‐ and c‐termini of lis1, respectively. however, these proteins, instead of simultaneously binding to lis1, appeared to bind to lis1 in a competitive manner. these results suggest that lis1 functions in nuclear migration by interacting with multiple intracellular proteins in mammals.
summarya systematic review was conducted to evaluate evidence concerning the effect of non-drug interventions by healthcare professionals on community-dwelling postmenopausal osteoporotic women. evidence available indicates that such interventions are effective in improving the quality of life, medication compliance, and calcium intake, but effect on other outcomes is less conclusive.introductionthe purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review to evaluate evidence concerning the effect of non-drug interventions by healthcare professionals on community-dwelling postmenopausal osteoporotic women.methodsrandomized controlled trials (rcts) published in english between year 1990 and 2009 were identified. types of patient outcome used as assessment included quality of life (qol), bone mineral density (bmd), medication compliance and persistence, knowledge level, and lifestyle modification.resultstwenty four rcts met the inclusion criteria. seven studies assessed interventions by physiotherapists, six by physicians, seven by nurses, three by multi-disciplinary teams and one by dietitians. variability in the types and intensity of interventions made comparison between each study difficult. collectively, these studies provided some evidence to show that interventions by healthcare professionals improved the qol medication compliance and calcium intake of patients but its effects on bmd, medication persistence, knowledge, and other lifestyle modifications were less conclusive.conclusionsfrom this review, it was found that some outcome measures of such non-drug interventions still required further studies. future studies should use validated instruments to assess the outcomes, with focus on common definitions of interventions and outcome measures, more intensive one-to-one interventions, appropriate control groups, adequate randomization procedures, and also provide information on effect size. background exercise programs improve balance, strength and agility in elderly people and thus may prevent falls. however, specific exercise programs that might be widely used in the community and that might be "prescribed" by physicians, especially for patients with osteoporosis, have not been evaluated. we conducted a randomized controlled trial of such a program designed specifically for women with osteoporosis.   methods we identified women 65 to 75 years of age in whom osteoporosis had been diagnosed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in our hospital between 1996 and 2000 and who were not engaged in regular weekly programs of moderate or hard exercise. women who agreed to participate were randomly assigned to participate in a twice-weekly exercise class or to not participate in the class. we measured baseline data and, 20 weeks later, changes in static balance (by dynamic posturography), dynamic balance (by a timed figure-eight run) and knee extension strength (by dynamometry).   results of 93 women who began the trial, 80 completed it. before adjustment for covariates, the intervention group tended to have greater, although nonsignificant, improvements in static balance (mean difference 4.8%, 95% confidence interval [ci] -1.3% to 11.0%), dynamic balance (mean difference 3.3%, 95% ci -1.7% to 8.4%) and knee extension strength (mean difference 7.8%, 95% ci -5.4% to 21.0%). mean crude changes in the static balance score were -0.85 (95% ci -2.91 to 1.21) for the control group and 1.40 (95% ci -0.66 to 3.46) for the intervention group. mean crude changes in figure-eight velocity (dynamic balance) were 0.08 (95% ci 0.02 to 0.14) m/s for the control group and 0.14 (95% ci 0.08 to 0.20) m/s for the intervention group. for knee extension strength, mean changes were -0.58 (95% ci -3.02 to 1.81) kg/m for the control group and 1.03 (95% ci -1.31 to 3.34) kg/m for the intervention group. after adjustment for age, physical activity and years of estrogen use, the improvement in dynamic balance was 4.9% greater for the intervention group than for the control group (p = 0.044). after adjustment for physical activity, cognitive status and number of fractures ever, the improvement in knee extension strength was 12.8% greater for the intervention group than for the control group (p = 0.047). the intervention group also had a 6.3% greater improvement in static balance after adjustment for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, but this difference was not significant (p = 0.06).   interpretation relative to controls, participants in the exercise program experienced improvements in dynamic balance and strength, both important determinants of risk for falls, particularly in older women with osteoporosis.
background and purposesmall animal irradiation systems were developed for preclinical evaluation of tumor therapy closely resembling the clinical situation. mostly only clinical linacs are available, so protocols for small animal partial body irradiation using a conventional clinical system are essential. this study defines a protocol for conformal brain tumor irradiations in mice.materials and methodsct and mri images were used to demarcate the target volume and organs at risk. three 6 mv photon beams were planned for a total dose of 10 fractions of 1.8 gy. the mouse position in a dedicated applicator was verified by an x‑ray patient positioning system before each irradiation. dosimetric verifications (using ionization chambers and films) were performed. irradiation-induced dna damage was analyzed to verify the treatment effects on the cellular level.resultsthe defined treatment protocol and the applied fractionation scheme were feasible. the in-house developed applicator was suitable for individual positioning at submillimeter accuracy of anesthetized mice during irradiation, altogether performed in less than 10 min. all mice tolerated the treatment well. measured dose values perfectly matched the nominal values from treatment planning. cellular response was restricted to the target volume.conclusionclinical linac-based irradiations of mice offer the potential to treat orthotopic tumors conformably. especially with respect to lateral penumbra, dedicated small animal irradiation systems exceed the clinical linac solution.zusammenfassunghintergrund und zielsetzungkleintierbestrahlungsanlagen wurden entwickelt um präklinische studien in der tumortherapie unter möglichst klinischen bedingungen durchzuführen. da an den meisten instituten nur klinische linacs zur verfügung stehen, werden standardprotokolle zur kleintierbestrahlung benötigt, die konventionelle systeme nutzen. in dieser studie wird ein solches protokoll für tumorkonforme hirnbestrahlung von mäusen definiert.materialien und methodenct- und mrt-bilder wurden aufgenommen, um zielvolumen und risikostrukturen festzulegen. drei 6‑mv-photonenfelder wurden auf eine gesamtdosis von 10 × 1,8 gy optimiert. die lage der maus innerhalb eines selbstentwickelten applikators wurde anhand eines patientenpositionierungssystems vor jeder bestrahlung verifiziert. strahlungseffekte wurden dosimetrisch mittels ionisationskammern und filmen als auch biologisch auf zellulärer ebene überprüft.ergebnissedas definierte bestrahlungsprotokoll und das applizierte fraktionierungsschema konnten erfolgreich angewendet werden. mit hilfe des eigens entwickelten applikators wurde eine individuelle und millimetergenaue positionierung der narkotisierten mäuse für die bestrahlung erreicht. positionierung und bestrahlung dauerten weniger als 10 min und wurden von allen mäusen toleriert. die berechneten werte aus dem planungssystem stimmten mit den gemessenen dosiswerten überein und zeigten auf das zielvolumen begrenzte zelluläre effekte.schlussfolgerungmittels klinischer linacs können orthotopische tumore von mäusen konform bestrahlt werden. im hinblick auf die laterale penumbra sind jedoch kleintierbestrahlungsanlagen überlegen. seventy hamsters were divided equally into experimental groups a and b and control groups c-g. after treating the pouches of groups a and b animals with dmba (thrice a week) for 14 weeks, the heads of the animals received fractionated radiation of a total dose of 21gy and 42gy, respectively. the untreated pouches of groups c and d animals were similarly irradiated. the pouches of groups e and f animals were treated with dmba or mineral oil for 14 weeks, respectively. the pouches of group g animals remained untreated throughout the experiment. radiation response (rr) was not noted for 12 exophytic tumors of group a; the remaining 43 tumors showed partial response. for group b, no rr was noted for four exophytic lesions; the remaining 28 lesions revealed a combination of partial and complete response. no endophytic lesions of group a showed rr; a significant increase in radiation response was noted for group b compared with group a. in conclusion, the hamster pouch oral cancer model could be employed to study the effect of fractionated radiation.
src family kinases (sfks), the largest family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, include 10 members. src was the first gene product discovered to have intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity. src is widely expressed in many cell types and can have different locations within a cell; the subcellular location of src can affect its function. src can associate with cellular membranes, such as the plasma membrane, the perinuclear membrane, and the endosomal membrane. sfks actions on mammalian cells are pleiotropic and include effect on cell morphology, adhesion, migration, invasion, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. sfks at one end have been documented to play some important physiological functions; on the other end, they have been described in the pathophysiology of some disorders. in this review article, an exhaustive attempt has been made to unearth pharmacology of sfks and therapeutic implications of sfks modulators. locoregional and distant recurrence remains common and usually fatal for patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc). one promising molecular target in hnscc is the src family kinases (sfk). sfks can affect cellular proliferation and survival by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) family of transcription factors, especially stat3. surprisingly, sustained sfk inhibition resulted in only transient inhibition of stat3. we investigated the mechanism underlying stat3 activation and its biological importance. specific c-src knockdown with small interfering rna (sirna) resulted in stat3 activation showing specificity, which was inhibited by janus-activated kinase (jak; tyk2 and jak2) depletion with sirna. sustained sfk inhibition also resulted in recovered jak-stat3 binding and jak kinase activity after an initial reduction, although jak phosphorylation paradoxically decreased. to determine the biological significance of stat3 activation, we combined specific stat3 depletion with a pharmacologic sfk inhibitor and observed increased cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. likewise, the addition of stat3- or jak-specific sirna to c-src-depleted cells enhanced cytotoxicity relative to cells incubated with c-src sirna alone. these results show that reactivation of stat3 after sustained, specific c-src inhibition is mediated through altered jak-stat3 binding and jak kinase activity and that this compensatory pathway allows for cancer cell survival and proliferation despite durable c-src inhibition. to our knowledge, this novel feedback pathway has never been described previously. given that pharmacologic sfk inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials, these results have potential clinical implications for cancer therapy.
recently, the number of patients with congenital heart diseases reaching adulthood has been progressively increasing in developed countries, and new issues are emerging: the evaluation of their capacity to cope with physical activity and whether this knowledge can be used to optimize medical management. a symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test has proven to be an essential tool, because it can objectively evaluate the functional cardiovascular capacity of these patients, identify the pathological mechanisms of the defect (circulatory failure, shunts, and/or pulmonary hypertension), and help prescribe an individualized rehabilitation program when needed. the common findings on cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with congenital heart diseases are a reduced peak [formula: see text]o2, an early anaerobic threshold, a blunted heart rate response, a reduced increase of vt, and an increased [formula: see text]e/[formula: see text]co2. all these measures suggest common pathophysiological abnormalities: (1) a compromised exercise capacity from anomalies affecting the heart, vessels, lungs, or muscles; (2) chronotropic incompetence secondary to cardiac autonomic dysfunction or β-blockers and antiarrhythmic therapy; and (3) ventilatory inefficiency caused by left-heart failure with pulmonary congestion, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary obstructive vascular disease, or cachexia. most of these variables also have prognostic significance. for these patients, cardiopulmonary exercise testing allows evaluation and decisions affecting lifestyle and therapeutic interventions. as the longevity of patients with congenital heart disease improves, the number surviving to adulthood will continue to rise. consequently, practicing physicians can expect to encounter an increasing number of adult patients with various congenital cardiac conditions. impaired exercise tolerance in this patient population is exceptionally common; adult patients with congenital heart disease have reduced exercise capacity compared with healthy, age-matched counterparts. the different methods of evaluating exercise capacity, the characteristic physiologic abnormalities encountered in patients with various congenital cardiac conditions, the pathophysiologic mechanisms that may account for these abnormalities, and the clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
the proto-oncoprotein cbl is known to control several signaling processes. it is highly expressed in the testis, and because spermatogenesis is androgen dependent, we investigated the androgen dependency expression of cbl through its testicular sublocalization and its expression levels in rats that were exposed to the antiandrogen flutamide or were hypophysectomized. we report the androgen dependency of cbl as it localizes in pachytene spermatocytes during androgen-dependent stages, is down-regulated upon flutamide exposure, and is up-regulated with testosterone in hypophysectomized rats. coculture experiments showed the key control exerted by the sertoli cell on cbl activity. as flutamide induces germ cell apoptosis, we investigate members of the bcl-2 family upon flutamide exposure. we show that the proapoptotic bcl-2 family member bim mirrored cbl expression through a posttranscriptional process. we also show that in cbl knockout mouse testes, the imbalance between the high expression of bim and smac/diablo and antiapoptotic factors such as cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 favors a survival process, which makes these mice unresponsive to androgen withdrawal and could explain their hypofertility. mechanisms of androgen-induced thymic involution are largely undefined. we have found that significant decreases in thymic size occur 2-4 h after a dose of testosterone is administered to castrated male mice. this rapid rate of change suggests a role for androgen-induced apoptosis in modulating the size and composition of the thymus. using thymic organ cultures to define these effects of androgens, we found that dihydrotestosterone treatment of thymus tissues from females or from castrated males results in enhancement of thymocyte apoptosis. intact (androgen-replete) or testicular feminization, tfm/y (androgen-resistant) mice failed to show apoptotic change with androgen treatment, although the apoptotic response to glucocorticoids was present, suggesting a requirement for a functional androgen receptor. acceleration of thymocyte apoptosis by androgens may mediate processes of thymocyte selection, with the potential to impart gender-specific characteristics on the peripheral t cell repertoire.
the tri-phasic reflex in hermit crab (pagurus pollicarus) abdomen is triggered by local mechanoreceptors and is essential for postural control. the reflex consists of three stereotypical phases: a brief, high-frequency burst, a transient cessation of firing, and a late-discharge that is much lower in frequency than the initial burst. to better understand the reflex generation of force, variability of motoneuron discharge in each of five parameters of reflex activation was assessed. an intracellular current injection routine was used to correlate each of these parameters with force production. phase 3 motoneuron firing frequency showed the greatest correlation with force production. phase 3 spike rate increased as a function of phase 2 duration, but the relationship between phase 2 duration and force produced by the reflex was weak. junction potential amplitude decreased as phase 2 duration increased, and we hypothesize that this trend counteracts the increased phase 3 frequency, explaining the weak relationship of phase 2 duration and force production. surprisingly, when phase 3 frequency was held constant and phase 2 was increased in duration, the concurrent decrease in junction potential amplitude did not reduce force production. cuticular strain associated with support of the shell of the hermit crab, pagurus pollicarus, by its abdomen activates mechanoreceptors that evoke a stereotyped reflex in postural motoneurons. this reflex consists of three phases: a brief high-frequency burst of motoneuron spikes, a pause, and a much longer duration but lower frequency period of spiking. these phases are correlated with a rapid increase in muscle force followed by a slight decline to a level of tone that is greater than that at rest but less than maximal. the present experiments address the mechanisms underlying the transition from the first to second phase of the reflex and their role in force generation. although centrally generated inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (ipsps) are present during the pause period of the reflex, intracellular current injection of motoneurons reveals a spike frequency adaptation that rapidly and substantially reduces motoneuron firing frequency and is unchanged in saline that reduces synaptic transmission. the adaptation is voltage sensitive and persists for several hundred milliseconds upon repolarization. hyperpolarization partially restores the initial response of the motoneuron to depolarizing current. spike frequency adaptation and synaptic inhibition are important mechanisms in the generation of force that maintains abdominal stiffness at a constant, submaximal level.
the 3'-noncoding region (3'-ncr) of the flavivirus genome includes a variable region that tolerates the insertion of heterologous genetic information. natural isolates of tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev) have particularly long variable regions, which, for some strains, include an internal poly(a) tract. we constructed luciferase reporter replicons of tbev to analyze the impact of various manipulations of the 3'-ncr on viral rna translation and replication. the choice of the reporter gene, its position and processing within the viral polyprotein, and the choice of standards were found to be important for obtaining a sensitive and reliable test system. we observed that truncation or complete removal of the internal poly(a) tract, or even the entire variable region, had no significant impact on translation and replication of the rna in mammalian cell culture. substitution of the variable region with foreign genetic elements impaired rna replication to various degrees but generally had no influence on viral translation. expression cassettes driven by an ires element inhibited rna replication more strongly than did repetitive protein-binding elements derived from a bacteriophage, even when the ligand that binds these elements was co-expressed in the cells. previously identified mutations in the ires partially relieved this inhibition when introduced into the reporter replicon but provided no evidence for intramolecular competition for translation factors. impairment of replication appeared to depend more on the type of foreign insert than on its length. these results provide a rational basis for the construction of tbev-based vectors or vaccines as well as molecular tools for studying flavivirus replication. abstract we have developed a reporting replicon of west nile virus (wnv) that could be used to quantitatively distinguish viral translation and rna replication. a renilla luciferase (rluc) gene was fused in-frame with the open reading frame of a subgenomic replicon in the position where the viral structural region was deleted, resulting in rlucrep. transfection of bhk cells with rlucrep rna yielded two distinctive rluc signal peaks, one between 2 and 10 h and the other after 26 h posttransfection. by contrast, only the 2- to 10-h rluc signal peak was observed in cells transfected with a mutant replicon containing an inactivated viral polymerase ns5 (rlucrep-ns5mt). immunofluorescence and real-time reverse transcriptase pcr assays showed that the levels of viral protein expression and rna replication increased in cells transfected with the rlucrep but not in those transfected with the rlucrep-ns5mt. these results suggest that the rluc signal that occurred at 2 to 10 h posttransfection reflects viral translation of the input replicon, while the rluc activity after 26 h posttransfection represents rna replication. using this system, we showed that mutations of conserved sequence (cs) elements within the 3′ untranslated region of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses did not significantly affect wnv translation but severely diminished or completely abolished rna replication. mutations of cs1 that blocked the potential base pairing with a conserved sequence in the 5′ region of the capsid gene (5′cs) abolished rna replication. restoration of the 5′cs-cs1 interaction rescued viral replication. replicons containing individual deletions of cs2, repeated cs2 (rcs2), cs3, or rcs3 were viable, but their rna replication was dramatically compromised. these results demonstrate that genome cyclization through the 5′cs-cs1 interaction is essential for wnv rna replication, whereas cs2, rcs2, cs3, and rcs3 facilitate, but are dispensable for, wnv replication.
summary the generation of tissue-specific cell types from human embryonic stem cells (hescs) is critical for the development of future stem cell-based regenerative therapies. here, we identify cd13 and ror2 as cell-surface markers capable of selecting early cardiac mesoderm emerging during hesc differentiation. we demonstrate that the cd13+/ror2+ population encompasses pre-cardiac mesoderm, which efficiently differentiates to all major cardiovascular lineages. we determined the engraftment potential of cd13+/ror2+ in small (murine) and large (porcine) animal models, and demonstrated that cd13+/ror2+ progenitors have the capacity to differentiate toward cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells in vivo. collectively, our data show that cd13 and ror2 identify a cardiac lineage precursor pool that is capable of successful engraftment into the porcine heart. these markers represent valuable tools for further dissection of early human cardiac differentiation, and will enable a detailed assessment of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac lineage cells for potential clinical applications. objective heterogeneity of action potential configuration in the left ventricle (lv), and the contribution of m cells to it, has been observed in the human heart and is important for arrhythmogenesis. whether the pig heart has similar properties remains a controversial but important issue as the pig heart is currently under study for use in xenotransplantation.   methods single myocytes were enzymatically isolated from the epicardium (epi, ncells = 29), midmyocardium (mid, ncells = 38), and endocardium (endo, ncells = 13) of the free lv wall (npigs = 26, 14-22 weeks old, 55-80 kg), and studied at different stimulation rates during whole-cell recording (normal tyrode's solution, k(+)-aspartate-based pipette solution, 50 microm k5fluo-3 as [ca2+]i indicator, 37 degrees c). standard six-lead ecgs were recorded from anesthetized pigs.   results the action potential duration (apd) was not significantly different at 0.25 hz vs. 2 hz for the majority of cells in all three layers. however, a subpopulation of cells behaved like m cells and had a very steep frequency response (apd90 at 0.25 hz 538 +/- 30 ms, vs. 337 +/- 9 ms at 2 hz, p < 0.05, n = 22). these cells were found predominantly in the mid layer (34% of cells), but also (24%) in epi. m cells had a more pronounced spike-and-dome configuration, with a significantly larger phase 1 magnitude and plateau voltage. the frequency response of these parameters was different from the other cell types. [ca2+]i transients tended to be larger in m cells. for the in vivo ecg of anesthetized pigs, the qt time was close to the apd90 of m cells, and j waves were seen in 7/12 recordings.   conclusions in young adult pigs, m cells can be identified by a steep frequency response of the apd and by a spike-and-dome configuration. these cells are mostly, but not exclusively, found in the midmyocardium, and could contribute to the ecg characteristics. their properties may however be different from those of other species, including humans.
this study was performed to determine the levels of eight heavy metals in irrigation well water and soil and to assess the suitability of some leafy green plants that are commonly cultivated in the al-kharj region, saudi arabia, for human consumption using an atomic absorption spectrometer. the mean concentrations of metals ranged from 0.0001 to 0.436 mg/l in well water and from 0.248 to 164.52 mg/kg in soil. the heavy metal concentrations showed significant differences among the different leafy green plants studied. parsley (4.98 mg/kg) exhibited higher levels of pb than other leafy green plants, whereas mallow (0.097 mg/kg) revealed greater amounts of cd than other plants. all of the leafy green plants retained essential metals (cu, zn, fe and mn) more than the toxic metals (pb and cd). the levels of some of the metals in the leafy green plants were found to meet the fao/who-recommended limits. the monitoring of heavy metals in leafy green plants must be continued because these plants are the main source of food for humans in many parts of the world and are considered to be bio-indicators for environmental pollution. the present study was carried out to assess levels of different heavy metals like iron, cadmium, nickel, lead, copper and zinc in vegetables irrigated with water from different sources industrial area of naini allahabad. the order of heavy metal concentration was found in fe > zn > cd > pb > ni > cu in irrigated water and fe > ni > zn > cu > cd > pb was observed in industrial contaminated sites of soils. metal levels observed in these sources were compared with who. the concentrations (mg/l) of heavy metals in irrigated water ranged from 0.249 to 0.257 for fe, 0.049 to 0.056 for zn, 0.028 to 0.036 for cd, 0.015 to 0.019 for cu, 0.035 to 0.042 for pb and 0.031 to 0.038 for ni which is lower than recommended maximum tolerable levels proposed by joint fao/who expert committee on food additives (2007), with the exception of cd and fe which exhibited elevated content. uptake and translocation factor of heavy metal from soil to edible parts of vegetables were quite distinguished for almost all elements examined. although the practice of growing leafy vegetables using wastewater for irrigation is aimed at producing socio-economic benefits but study reveals that heavy metal-contaminated vegetables grown in wastewater-irrigated areas may pose public health hazards which is not safe and may not be sustainable in the long-term.
the authors retrospectively evaluated 30 patients with an anterior cervical interbody fusion for cervical spondylosis or disc herniation. open box carbon fiber cages were used at 45 levels. the visual analogue scales (vas), respectively for neck and for arm pain, and the neck disability index (ndi) improved significantly (p < 0.001). fusion occurred in 87% of the operated levels. subsidence of the cages into the endplates was observed in 49% of the operated levels, which increased to 54% when more levels were fused. no correlation between subsidence of the cage and clinical outcome or radiographic fusion was established. the authors conclude that cervical discectomy and interbody fusion using an open box carbon fiber cage is a satisfactory treatment option for degenerative cervical disease causing neck pain and radiculopathy, despite the relatively high percentage of subsidence of this cage. the aim of this work was to add to the body of data on the frequency and severity of degenerative radiographic findings at adjacent levels after anterior cervical interbody fusion and on their clinical impact and to contribute to the insights about their pathogenesis. one hundred eighty patients who were treated by anterior cervical interbody fusion and who had a follow-up of >60 months were clinically and radiologically examined by independent investigators. for all patients, the long-term odom score was compared with the score as obtained 6 weeks after surgery. for myelopathic cases, both the late nurick and the odom score were compared with the initial postoperative situation. for the adjacent disc levels, a radiologic “degeneration score” was defined and assessed both initially and at long-term follow-up. at late follow-up after anterior cervical interbody fusion, additional radiologic degeneration at the adjacent disc levels was found in 92% of the cases, often reflecting a clinical deterioration. the severity of this additional degeneration correlated with the time interval since surgery. the similarity of progression to degeneration between younger trauma patients and older nontrauma patients suggests that both the biomechanical impact of the interbody fusion and the natural progression of pre-existing degenerative disease act as triggering factors for adjacent level degeneration.
aims. to examine the effect of alpha-lipoic acid, an antioxidant with mitochondrial superoxide inhibitory properties, on adrenocorticotrophic hormone- (acth-ht) and dexamethasone-induced hypertensions (dex-ht) in rats and if any antihypertensive effect is mediated via mitochondrial superoxide inhibition. methods. in a prevention study, rats received ground food or alpha-lipoic-acid-laced food (10 mg/rat/day) for 15 nights. saline, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (acth, 0.2 mg/kg/day), or dexamethasone (dex, 10 μg/rat/day) was injected subcutaneously from day 5 to day 11. in a reversal study, rats received alpha-lipoic-acid-laced food 4 days after commencement of saline or dex. tail-cuff systolic blood pressure (sbp) was measured second daily. kidney mitochondrial superoxide was examined using (mitosox) red (mitosox) via flow cytometry. results. sbp was increased by acth (p < 0.0005) and dex (p < 0.0005). alpha-lipoic acid alone did not alter sbp. with alpha-lipoic acid pretreatment, sbp was increased by acth (p′ < 0.005) but not by dex. alpha-lipoic partially prevented acth-ht (p′ < 0.0005) and fully prevented dex-ht (p′ < 0.0005) but failed to reverse dex-ht. acth and dex did not increase mitosox signal. in acth-hypertensive rats, high-dose alpha-lipoic acid (100 mg/rat/day) did not decrease sbp further but raised mitosox signal (p < 0.001), suggesting prooxidant activity. conclusion. glucocorticoid-induced hypertension in rats is prevented by alpha-lipoic acid via mechanisms other than mitochondrial superoxide reduction. diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the united states. despite several studies indicating a role for mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of diabetic complications, the precise mechanisms underlying renal mitochondrial dysfunction and renal cell injury remain unclear. the hypothesis of the current study was that high-glucose-mediated generation of mitochondrial superoxide is a key early event that leads to mitochondrial injury in renal proximal tubular cells. to ascertain the role of mitochondrial superoxide we have tested whether overexpression of the primary mitochondrial antioxidant, manganese superoxide dismutase (mnsod), protects against hyperglycemia-induced renal injury using normal rat renal proximal tubular cells (nrk). nrk cells were exposed to high glucose (25 mm) and the changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, atp levels, and superoxide generation and the loss of cell viability were measured at 24 and 48 h after high glucose exposure. our results indicate that high glucose first induced superoxide generation and hyperpolarization in the mitochondria, followed by a secondary event, which involved a decline in atp levels, partial complex iii inactivation, and loss of cell viability. these high-glucose-induced changes were completely prevented by overexpression of mnsod in nrk cells. however, mnsod activity was not changed after high glucose exposure in vitro or during the early stages of diabetes using the streptozotocin rat model. these findings show for the first time that hyperglycemic induction of superoxide production within the mitochondria initiates specific mitochondrial injury (i.e., complex iii) via a mechanism independent of mnsod inactivation.
objective—the purpose of this study was to identify predictors of the onset of disturbed eating behavior (deb) in adolescent girls with type 1 diabetes. research design and methods—in this prospective study, participants completed the children's eating disorder examination interview and self-report measures at baseline and at four follow-up assessments over 5 years. participants were 126 girls with type 1 diabetes, aged 9–13 years at baseline. of the 101 girls who did not have deb at baseline, 45 developed deb during the follow-up period; the 38 for whom data were available for the assessment before onset of deb were compared with 38 age-matched girls who did not develop deb. deb was defined as dieting for weight control, binge eating, self-induced vomiting, or the use of diuretics, laxatives, insulin omission, or intense exercise for weight control. results—logistic regression indicated that a model including bmi percentile, weight and shape concern, global and physical appearance-based self-worth, and depression was significantly associated with deb onset (χ2 = 46.0, 5 d.f., p < 0.0001) and accounted for 48.2% of the variance. conclusions—even though scores on the measures were within the published normal range, the onset of deb was predicted by higher depression and weight and shape concerns and lower global and physical appearance–based self-worth as well as higher bmi percentile 1–2 years earlier compared with those not developing deb. early interventions focused on helping girls with diabetes develop positive feelings about themselves, their weight and shape, and their physical appearance may have protective value. objective to characterize the relationship of subclinical and clinical eating disorders to hba1c values in women with iddm. research design and methods ninety women with iddm (18–46 years of age) were recruited from diabetes clinics throughout connecticut and massachusetts. subjects were categorized into one of three groups according to the diagnostic statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm-iii-r) criteria for eating disorders as follows: the clinical group (n = 14), the subclinical group (partially fulfilling the diagnostic criteria; n = 13), and the control group (n = 63). group differences in the degree of dietary restraint, binge eating, and bulimic behaviors and weight, shape, and eating concerns were assessed with the eating disorder examination (ede) and the bulimia test revised (bulit-r). results women with subclinical and clinical eating disorders had clinically elevated hba1c results and more diabetes-related complications, compared with the control subjects. the severity of bulimic behaviors, weight concerns, reduced bmi, and decreased frequency of blood glucose monitoring were associated with elevated hba1c. conclusions hba1c may have clinical utility in the identification of eating disorder behavior in females with iddm. health care professionals should be aware of the potent effect of subclinical and clinical eating behaviors including insulin misuse in weight-conscious women with iddm who have poor glycemic control.
purposeintracranial electrodes are sometimes implanted in patients with refractory epilepsy to identify epileptic foci and propagation. maximal recording of eeg activity from regions suspected of seizure generation is paramount. however, the location of individual contacts cannot be considered with current manual planning approaches. we propose and validate a procedure for optimizing intracranial electrode implantation planning that maximizes the recording volume, while constraining trajectories to safe paths.methodsretrospective data from 20 patients with epilepsy that had electrodes implanted in the mesial temporal lobes were studied. clinical imaging data (ct/a and t1w mri) were automatically segmented to obtain targets and structures to avoid. these data were used as input to the optimization procedure. each electrode was modeled to assess risk, while individual contacts were modeled to estimate their recording capability. ordered lists of trajectories per target were obtained. global optimization generated the best set of electrodes. the procedure was integrated into a neuronavigation system.resultstrajectories planned automatically covered statistically significant larger target volumes than manual plans $$({p}<0.001)$$(p<0.001). median volume coverage was $$419\,\hbox { mm}^{3}$$419mm3 for automatic plans versus $$23\,\hbox { mm}^{3}$$23mm3 for manual plans. furthermore, automatic plans remained at statistically significant safer distance to vessels $$({p}<0.05)$$(p<0.05) and sulci $$({p}<0.001)$$(p<0.001). surgeon’s scores of the optimized electrode sets indicated that 95 % of the automatic trajectories would be likely considered for use in a clinical setting.conclusionsthis study suggests that automatic electrode planning for epilepsy provides safe trajectories and increases the amount of information obtained from the intracranial investigation. purposeboth frame-based and frameless approaches to deep brain stimulation (dbs) require planning of insertion trajectories that mitigate hemorrhagic risk and loss of neurological function. currently, this is done by manual inspection of multiple potential electrode trajectories on mr-imaging data. we propose and validate a method for computer-assisted dbs trajectory planning.methodour framework integrates multi-modal mri analysis (t1w, swi, tof-mra) to compute suitable dbs trajectories that optimize the avoidance of specific critical brain structures. a cylinder model is used to process each trajectory and to evaluate complex surgical constraints described via a combination of binary and fuzzy segmented datasets. the framework automatically aggregates the multiple constraints into a unique ranking of recommended low-risk trajectories. candidate trajectories are represented as a few well-defined cortical entry patches of best-ranked trajectories and presented to the neurosurgeon for final trajectory selection.resultsthe proposed algorithm permits a search space containing over 8,000 possible trajectories to be processed in less than 20 s. a retrospective analysis on 14 dbs cases of patients with severe parkinson’s disease reveals that our framework can improve the simultaneous optimization of many pre-formulated surgical constraints. furthermore, all automatically computed trajectories were evaluated by two neurosurgeons, were judged suitable for surgery and, in many cases, were judged preferable or equivalent to the manually planned trajectories used during the operation.conclusionsthis work provides neurosurgeons with an intuitive and flexible decision-support system that allows objective and patient-specific optimization of dbs lead trajectories, which should improve insertion safety and reduce surgical time.
introductionprior studies have demonstrated an increased frequency of antibodies to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), a leading agent of periodontal disease, in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) patients. however, these patients generally had long-standing disease, and clinical associations with these antibodies were inconsistent. our goal was to examine pg antibody responses and their clinical associations in patients with early ra prior to and after disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (dmard) therapy.methodsserum samples from 50 dmard-naïve ra patients were tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with whole-pg sonicate. for comparison, serum samples were tested from patients with late ra, patients with other connective tissue diseases (ctds), age-similar healthy hospital personnel and blood bank donors. pg antibody responses in early ra patients were correlated with standard ra biomarkers, measures of disease activity and function.resultsat the time of enrollment, 17 (34%) of the 50 patients with early ra had positive immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody responses to pg, as did 13 (30%) of the 43 patients with late ra. ra patients had significantly higher pg antibody responses than healthy hospital personnel and blood bank donors (p < 0.0001). additionally, ra patients tended to have higher pg antibody reactivity than patients with other ctds (p = 0.1), and ctd patients tended to have higher pg responses than healthy participants (p = 0.07). compared with pg antibody-negative patients, early ra patients with positive pg responses more often had anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-ccp) antibody reactivity, their anti-ccp levels were significantly higher (p = 0.03) and the levels of anti-pg antibodies correlated directly with anti-ccp levels (p < 0.01). furthermore, at the time of study entry, the pg-positive antibody group had greater rheumatoid factor values (p = 0.04) and higher inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or esr) (p = 0.05), and they tended to have higher disease activity scores (disease activity score based on 28-joint count (das28)-esr and clinical disease activity index) and more functional impairment (health assessment questionnaire). in pg-positive patients, greater disease activity was still apparent after 12 months of dmard therapy.conclusionsa subset of early ra patients had positive pg antibody responses. the responses correlated with anti-ccp antibody reactivity and to a lesser degree with esr values. there was a trend toward greater disease activity in pg-positive patients, and this trend remained after 12 months of dmard therapy. these findings are consistent with a role for pg in disease pathogenesis in a subset of ra patients. introductionthe association between rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and periodontitis is suggested to be linked to the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. colonization of p. gingivalis in the oral cavity of ra patients has been scarcely considered. to further explore whether the association between periodontitis and ra is dependent on p. gingivalis, we compared host immune responses in ra patients with and without periodontitis in relation to presence of cultivable p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque.methodsin 95 ra patients, the periodontal condition was examined using the dutch periodontal screening index for treatment needs. subgingival plaque samples were tested for presence of p. gingivalis by anaerobic culture technique. iga, igg and igm antibody titers to p. gingivalis were measured by elisa. serum and subgingival plaque measures were compared to a matched control group of non-ra subjects.resultsa higher prevalence of severe periodontitis was observed in ra patients in comparison to matched non-ra controls (27% versus 12%, p < 0.001). ra patients with severe periodontitis had higher das28 scores than ra patients with no or moderate periodontitis (p < 0.001), while no differences were seen in igm-rf or acpa reactivity. furthermore, ra patients with severe periodontitis had higher igg- and igm-anti p. gingivalis titers than non-ra controls with severe periodontitis (p < 0.01 resp. p < 0.05), although subgingival occurrence of p. gingivalis was not different.conclusionsseverity of periodontitis is related to severity of ra. ra patients with severe periodontitis have a more robust antibody response against p. gingivalis than non-ra controls, but not all ra patients have cultivable p. gingivalis.
abstract:we study the low-velocity (0.1-100 μm s-1) frictional properties of interfaces between a rough glassy polymer and smooth silanized glass, a configuration which gives direct access to the rheology of the adhesive joints in which shear localizes. we show that these joints exhibit the full phenomenology expected for confined quasi-2d soft glasses: they strengthen logarithmically when aging at rest, and weaken (rejuvenate) when sliding. rejuvenation is found to saturate at large velocities. moreover, aging at rest is shown to be strongly accelerated when waiting under finite stress below the static threshold. it sounds good when knowing the the mechanics of earthquakes and faulting 2nd edition in this website. this is one of the books that many people looking for. in the past, many people ask about this book as their favourite book to read and collect. and now, we present hat you need quickly. it seems to be so happy to offer you this famous book. it will not become a unity of the way for you to get amazing benefits at all. but, it will serve something that will let you get the best time and moment to spend for reading the book.
abstract anaplasma phagocytophilum, a member of the family anaplasmataceae, is the tick-transmitted obligate intracellular bacterium that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis. the life cycle of a. phagocytophilum is biphasic, transitioning between the noninfectious reticulate cell (rc) and infectious dense-cored (dc) forms. we analyzed the bacterium's dc surface proteome by selective biotinylation of surface proteins, neutravidin affinity purification, and mass spectrometry. transcriptional profiling of selected outer membrane protein candidates over the course of infection revealed that aph_0248 (designated asp14 [14-kda a. phagocytophilum surface protein]) expression was upregulated the most during a. phagocytophilum cellular invasion. asp14 transcription was induced during transmission feeding of a. phagocytophilum-infected ticks on mice and was upregulated when the bacterium engaged its receptor, p-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1. asp14 localized to the a. phagocytophilum surface and was expressed during in vivo infection. treating dc organisms with asp14 antiserum or preincubating mammalian host cells with glutathione s-transferase (gst)–asp14 significantly inhibited infection of host cells. moreover, preincubating host cells with gst-tagged forms of both asp14 and outer membrane protein a, another a. phagocytophilum invasin, pronouncedly reduced infection relative to treatment with either protein alone. the asp14 domain that is sufficient for cellular adherence and invasion lies within the c-terminal 12 to 24 amino acids and is conserved among other anaplasma and ehrlichia species. these results identify asp14 as an a. phagocytophilum surface protein that is critical for infection, delineate its invasion domain, and demonstrate the potential of targeting asp14 in concert with ompa for protecting against infection by a. phagocytophilum and other anaplasmataceae pathogens. anaplasma phagocytophilum, ehrlichia chaffeensis and ehrlichia ewingii are emerging tick-borne pathogens and are the causative agents of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, human monocytic ehrlichiosis and e. ewingii ehrlichiosis, respectively. collectively, these are referred to as human ehrlichioses. these obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens of the family anaplasmataceae are transmitted by ixodes spp. or amblyomma americanum ticks and infect peripherally circulating leukocytes to cause infections that range in clinical spectra from asymptomatic seroconversion to mild, severe or, in rare instances, fatal disease. this review describes: the ecology of each pathogen; the epidemiology, clinical signs and symptoms of the human diseases that each causes; the choice methods for diagnosing and treating human ehrlichioses; recommendations for patient management; and is concluded with suggestions for potential future research.
background sensitive screening methods have revealed that many patients have donor-specific human leucocyte antigen antibodies (dsas) prior to transplantation, regardless of negative crossmatch results. the clinical significance of pre-transplant (pre-tx) dsas for early graft function has remained unclear. our aim was to examine the association of dsas with delayed graft function (dgf).   methods pre-tx sera of 771 patients who received kidney transplants in our single-centre study were retrospectively screened. all transplantations were performed after negative complement-dependent cytotoxicity (cdc) crossmatch.   results dsas were detected in 13% of the patients. the overall dgf rate in our study was 29%. patients with dsas had a higher incidence of dgf when compared with non-sensitized patients (48 and 26%, respectively; p < 0.0001). third-party antibodies had no effect for dgf incidence (28%; p = 0.6098). the relative risk (rr) of dgf for patients with dsas in the multivariate analysis was 2.039 (95% ci 1.246-3.335; p = 0.0046). analyses of the cumulative mean fluorescent intensity (mfi) value of the dsas revealed a rate of dgf more than two times higher in patients with a cumulative value of 3000-5000 mfi compared with a cumulative value of 1000-3000 (65 versus 31%; p = 0.0351). dsas against any loci showed an elevated dgf incidence of 44-69% when compared with patients without dsa (27%).   conclusions the risk of dgf is twice as high in patients having pre-formed dsas. pre-tx dsas is a modifiable risk factor that can be obviated with careful organ allocation relying on careful pre-tx analysis of non-accepted mismatches determined with sensitive solid phase methods. delayed graft function (dgf) is a common complication of deceased donor kidney transplantation with negative impact on clinical outcomes. in a single‐center retrospective analysis, we compared patient and kidney survival, early renal function, and the incidence of acute rejection during the first year among all adult deceased donor kidney transplant patients without dgf, with dgf requiring one‐time and/or more than one‐time dialysis treatment between january 1, 2000, and december 31, 2008. of 831 adult kidney transplant patients, 74 (8.9%) required one‐time and 134 (16.1%) more than one‐time dialysis treatment post‐transplantation, respectively. while dgf patients with one‐time dialysis treatment had comparable clinical outcomes to that of patients without dgf, patients with dgf requiring more than one‐time dialysis treatment had a 45% increased risk for death (hr 1.45, 95% ci 1.02, 2.05, p = 0.04) after adjustment for the differences in demographic and baseline characteristics. furthermore, dgf patients with more than one‐time dialysis requirement displayed significantly lower renal function after recovery (or 0.32, 95% ci 0.21, 0.49, p < 0.001, for egfr ≥ 60 ml/min) and higher incidence of acute rejection during the first year (or 1.66, 95% ci 1.11, 2.49, p = 0.015). additional studies of therapeutic approaches to manage patients with prolonged dgf are needed.
in this paper, we proposed a new projection completion metal artifact reduction (mar) algorithm in x-ray computed tomography (ct) using a sparsity based sinogram inpainting (interpolation) technique. we developed the mar algorithm on a bayesian framework in which a wavelet-based generalized gaussian (ℓp) prior was applied and then the inpainting problem was formulated as a constrained optimization problem. for the optimization, we derived a projected gradient descent algorithm using a majorization-minimization technique. the gradient step was performed by a soft thresholding operator for an ℓ1 prior, and a hard thresholding with a decaying threshold for an ℓ0 prior. we utilized a tight frame of translation-invariant wavelets implemented by undecimated discrete wavelet transform. as in the clinical setting there is no ground truth ct image to objectively evaluate the performance of a proposed mar algorithm, we also introduced a novel approach to simulate metal artifacts in a real ct dataset. the results showed that the proposed mar algorithm using hard thresholding efficiently recovers and inpaints the sinogram projections corrupted by metallic implants. traditional computed tomography (ct) reconstructions of total joint prostheses are limited by metal artifacts from corrupted projection data. published metal artifact reduction methods are based on the assumption that severe attenuation of x-rays by prostheses renders corresponding portions of projection data unavailable, hence the "missing" data are either avoided (in iterative reconstruction) or interpolated (in filtered back-projection with data completion; typically, with filling data "gaps" via linear functions). here, the authors propose a wavelet-based multiresolution analysis method for metal artifact reduction, in which information is extracted from corrupted projection data. the wavelet method improves image quality by a successive interpolation in the wavelet domain. theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the metal artifacts due to both photon starving and beam hardening can be effectively suppressed using the authors' method. as compared to the filtered back-projection after linear interpolation, the wavelet-based reconstruction is significantly more accurate for depiction of anatomical structures, especially in the immediate neighborhood of the prostheses. this superior imaging precision is highly advantageous in geometric modeling for fitting hip prostheses.
many organizations attempt to deploy methodologies intended to improve software development processes. however, resistance by individual software developers against using such methodologies often obstructs their successful deployment. to better explain why individual developers accept or resist methodologies, five theoretical models of individual intentions to accept information technology tools were examined. in a field study of 128 developers in a large organization that implemented a methodology, each model explained significant variance in developers' intentions to use the methodology. similar to findings from the tool adoption context, we found that, if a methodology is not regarded as useful by developers, its prospects for successful deployment may be severely undermined. in contrast to the typical pattern of findings in a tool context, however, we found that methodology adoption intentions are driven by: 1) the presence of an organizational mandate to use the methodology, 2) the compatibility of the methodology with how developers perform their work, and 3) the opinions of developers' coworkers and supervisors toward using the methodology. collectively, these results provide surprising new insights into why software developers accept or resist methodologies and suggest what software engineering managers might do to overcome developer resistance. success at attempted weight reduction among college women was predicted on the basis of a theory of planned behavior. at the beginning of a 6-week period, participants expressed their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived control, and intentions with respect to losing weight. in addition, the extent to which they had made detailed weight reduction plans was assessed, as were a number of general attitudes and personality factors. in support of the theory, intentions to lose weight were accurately predicted on the basis of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control; perceived control and intentions were together moderately successful in predicting the amount of weight that participants actually lost over the 6-week period. actual weight loss was also found to increase with development of a plan and with ego strength, factors that were assumed to increase control over goal attainment. other factors, such as health locus of control, perceived competence, and action control, were found to be unrelated to weight reduction.
selective strengthening of specific glutamatergic synapses in the mammalian hippocampus is critical for encoding new memories. this is most commonly achieved by input-specific hebbian-type plasticity involving glutamate-dependent coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic depolarization. our results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which nicotinic signaling, independently of coincident fast glutamatergic transmission, increases synaptic strength in the hippocampus. electrophysiological recordings from rat hippocampal neurons in culture revealed that 1–3 h of exposure to 1 μm nicotine, even with action potentials being blocked, produced increases in both the frequency and amplitude of miniature epscs. possible mechanisms were analyzed both in mouse organotypic slice culture and in rat cell culture by inducing the cells to express super-ecliptic phluorin-tagged glua1-containing ampa receptors, which fluoresce only on the cell surface. pharmacological and genetic manipulation of the cells, in combination with fluorescence-recovery-after-photobleaching experiments, revealed that nicotine, acting through α7-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, induces the stabilization and accumulation of glua1-containing ampa receptors on dendritic spines. the process relies on intracellular calcium signaling, pdz [postsynaptic density-95 (psd-95)/discs large (dlg)/zona occludens-1 (zo-1)] interactions with members of the psd-95 family, and lateral diffusion of the glua1 receptors on the cell surface. these findings define a new avenue by which nicotinic signaling modulates synaptic mechanisms thought to subserve learning and memory. activity-dependent gene expression is essential for form and function in the nervous system. best understood is the role of glutamatergic signaling in controlling such events, but nicotinic signaling can also regulate transcription. we show here that nicotine can alter gene expression in rat hippocampal neurons, as reflected by activation of the transcription factor creb and appearance of the immediate early gene product c-fos. the process depends on both cam and map kinases and on calcium release from internal stores. part of the nicotinic effect is mediated via glutamatergic transmission, even in the absence of action potentials. voltage-gated calcium channels are not necessary for nicotine-induced activation of creb in hippocampal neurons. the low levels of sustained nicotinic stimulation required for transcriptional effects are consistent with those likely to be achievable either by the normal septal cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus or by repeated tobacco usage.
postinhibitory rebound (pir) is defined as membrane depolarization occurring at the offset of a hyperpolarizing stimulus and is one of several intrinsic properties that may promote rhythmic electrical activity. pir can be produced by several mechanisms including hyperpolarization-activated cation current (ih) or deinactivation of depolarization-activated inward currents. excitatory swim motor neurons in the leech exhibit pir in response to injected current pulses or inhibitory synaptic input. serotonin, a potent modulator of leech swimming behavior, increases the peak amplitude of pir and decreases its duration, effects consistent with supporting rhythmic activity. in this study, we performed current clamp experiments on dorsal excitatory cell 3 (de-3) and ventral excitatory cell 4 (ve-4). we found a significant difference in the shape of pir responses expressed by these two cell types in normal saline, with de-3 exhibiting a larger prolonged component. exposing motor neurons to serotonin eliminated this difference. cs+ had no effect on pir, suggesting that ih plays no role. pir was suppressed completely when low na+ solution was combined with ca2+ -channel blockers. our data support the hypothesis that pir in swim motor neurons is produced by a combination of low-threshold na+ and ca2+ currents that begin to activate near −60 mv. bath application of dopamine modifies the rhythmic motor pattern generated by the 14 neuron pyloric network in the stomatogastric ganglion of the spiny lobster, panulirus interruptus. among other effects, dopamine excites many of the pyloric constrictor (py) neurons to fire at high frequency and phase-advances the timing of their activity in the motor pattern. these responses arise in part from direct actions of dopamine to modulate the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the py cells, and can be studied in synaptically isolated neurons. the rate of rebound following a hyperpolarizing prestep and the spike frequency during a subsequent depolarization are both accelerated by dopamine. based on theoretical simulations, hartline (1979) suggested that the rate of postinhibitory rebound in stomatogastric neurons could vary with the amount of voltage- sensitive transient potassium current (ia). consistent with this prediction, we found that dopamine evokes a net conductance decrease in synaptically isolated py neurons. in voltage clamp, dopamine reduces ia, specifically by reducing the amplitude of the slowly inactivating component of the current and shifting its voltage activation curve in the depolarized direction. 4-aminopyridine, a selective blocker of ia in stomatogastric neurons, mimics and occludes the effects of dopamine on isolated py neurons. a conductance-based mathematical model of the py neuron shows appropriate changes in activity upon quantitative modification of the ia parameters affected by dopamine. these results demonstrate that dopamine excites and phase-advances the py neurons in the rhythmic pyloric motor pattern at least in part by reducing the transient k+ current, ia.
central akt, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nnos) and n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 2b (nr2b) play key roles in the development of neuropathic pain. here we investigate the effects of glucocorticoid receptors (grs) on the expression and activation of spinal akt, nnos and nr2b after chronic compression of dorsal root ganglia (ccd). thermal hyperalgesia test and mechanical allodynia test were used to measure rats after intrathecal injection of gr antagonist mifepristone or gr agonist dexamethasone for 21 days postoperatively. expression of spinal akt, nnos, nr2b and their phosphorylation state after ccd was examined by western blot. the effects of intrathecal treatment with dexamethasone or mifepristone on nociceptive behaviors and the corresponding expression of akt, nnos and nr2b in spinal cord were also investigated. intrathecal injection of mifepristone or dexamethasone inhibited pwmt and pwtl in ccd rats. however, hyperalgesia was induced by intrathecal injection of dexamethasone on days 12 to 14 after surgery. treatment of dexamethasone increased the expression and phosphorylation levels of spinal akt, nnos, gr and nr2b time dependently, whereas administration of mifepristone downregulated the expression of these proteins significantly. grs activated spinal akt–nnos/nr2b pathway play important roles in the development of neuropathic pain in a time-dependent manner. objective to determine the effectiveness and predictors of response to lumbar epidural corticosteroid injections (esi) in patients with sciatica. we performed a 12-month, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in four secondary pain-care clinics in the wessex region.   methods two hundred and twenty-eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of unilateral sciatica of 1-18 months' duration were randomized to either three lumbar esis of triamcinolone acetonide or interligamentous saline injections at intervals of 3 weeks. the main outcome measure was the oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire (odq).   results at 3 weeks, the esi group demonstrated a transient benefit over the placebo group (patients achieving a 75% improvement in odq, 12.5 vs 3.7%; number needed to treat, 11.4). no benefit was demonstrated from 6 to 52 weeks. esis did not improve physical function, hasten return to work or reduce the need for surgery. there was no benefit of repeated esis over single injection. no clinical predictors of response were found. at the end of the study the majority of patients still had significant pain and disability regardless of intervention.   conclusions in this pragmatic study, esis offered transient benefit in symptoms at 3 weeks in patients with sciatica, but no sustained benefits in terms of pain, function or need for surgery. sciatica is a chronic condition requiring a multidisciplinary approach. to fully investigate the value of esis, they need to be evaluated as part of a multidisciplinary approach.
abstract this study investigated the effect of ambient cadmium (cd) on haemocyte apoptosis of the shrimp, penaeus monodon. cellular response was determined in cd-exposed (0, 0.05, 0.5 and 5 mg l−1) shrimp. results showed that 0.05 mg l−1 cd2+ had no significant effect on the haemocyte parameters during the 48 h exposure. cadmium at doses of 0.5 and 5 mg l−1 depressed the total haemocyte count (thc), and increased reactive oxygen species (ros) production and apoptosis ratio in haemocytes. esterase activity increased in shrimp exposed to 0.5 mg l−1 cd2+ for 6 h, and decreased to the initial level later. depressed esterase activity could be observed in shrimp after 24 and 48 h exposure to 5 mg l−1 cd2+. these results demonstrated that cd2+ modified esterase activity and induced ros generation, which led to haemocyte apoptosis and thc reduction. oxidative stress is one of the induction mechanisms for cd-caused apoptosis of shrimp haemocytes. lack of shrimp cell lines has hindered the study of pollutants which adversely affects shrimp health and its export value. in this context a primary haemocyte culture developed from penaeus monodon was employed for assessing the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of two heavy metal compounds, cadmium chloride and mercuric chloride and two organophosphate insecticides, malathion and monocrotophos. using mtt assay 12 h ic(50) values calculated were 31.09 ± 16.27 μm and 5.52 ± 1.16 μm for cadmium chloride and mercuric chloride and 59.94 ± 52.30 mg l(-1) and 186.76 ± 77.00 mg l(-1) for malathion and monocrotophos respectively. employing comet assay, dna damage inflicted by these pollutants on haemocytes were evaluated and the pollutants induced dna damage in >60% of the cells. the study suggested that haemocyte culture could be used as a tool for quantifying cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of aquaculture drugs, management chemicals and pollutants.
abstract investigation of a modifier locus displaying a darker eye phenotype in white-apricot flies led to the isolation of the gene encoding udp-glucose dehydrogenase (udpgdh). the p-element insertion  l(3)05007 occurs upstream of the transcription start site of the sugarless (sgl) gene and greatly reduces its transcription at various developmental stages. a single abundant sgl transcript shows a ubiquitous distribution and encodes a 53-kda protein which is 64% identical in sequence to bovine udp-glucose dehydrogenase. overexpression of sgl in e. coli resulted in synthesis of a protein with high levels of udpgdh activity. expression of three genes that participate in pigment deposition, white, scarlet and brown, was significantly affected in populations segregating for sgl, suggesting that it is the decrease in udpgdh level that produces the modifying effect observed. in addition, genetic effects on white-apricot were observed in sgl-wingless and sgl-hedgehog double mutants. recent data have indicated an effect of udpgdh on cell surface glycosaminoglycans (gags) which modulate the activity of growth factors, and in particular wingless signaling. our results suggest that the levels of gags are rate limiting for cell-cell signaling pathways which mediate changes in gene expression. in vitro experiments suggest that glycosaminoglycans (gags) and the proteins to which they are attached (proteoglycans) are important for modulating growth factor signaling. however, in vivo evidence to support this view has been lacking, in part because mutations that disrupt the production of gag polymers and the core proteins have not been available. here we describe the identification and characterization of drosophila mutants in the suppenkasper (ska) gene. the ska gene encodes udp-glucose dehydrogenase which produces glucuronic acid, an essential component for the synthesis of heparan and chondroitin sulfate. ska mutants fail to put heparan side chains on proteoglycans such as syndecan. surprisingly, mutant embryos produced by germ-line clones of this general metabolic gene exhibit embryonic cuticle phenotypes strikingly similar to those that result from loss-of-function mutations in genes of the wingless (wg) signaling pathway. zygotic loss of ska leads to reduced growth of imaginal discs and pattern defects similar to wg mutants. in addition, genetic interactions of ska with wg and dishevelled mutants are observed. these data demonstrate the importance of proteoglycans and gags in wg signaling in vivo and suggest that wnt-like growth factors may be particularly sensitive to perturbations of gag biosynthesis.
opponent: chaitanya gurram, 19890710-9535, chgb11@student.bth.se thesis title: software development in startup companies (mse-2012:99) this report presents the opponent review for the master thesis presented on 26th september, 2012. this report is helpful for the defendants to improve their thesis in a constructive manner. the sections in this report are presented consistently with ones that are used in the defendant's thesis for understandability. introduction  authors have clearly defined the problem. need for addressing the problem was well-motivated. moreover, it is important to address the problem defined by authors because of growing interest towards startups in software industry. contributions of the thesis were clearly stated by authors in introduction section. by reading the introduction, one can understand what entire thesis is speaking about. grounded theory, as an evolving qualitative research method, is a product of its history as well as of its epistemology. within the literature, there have been a number of discussions focusing on the differences between glaser's (1978, 1992) and strauss's (1987, 1990) versions of grounded theory. the purpose of this article is to add a level of depth and breadth to this discussion through specifically exploring the glaser-strauss debate by comparing the data analysis processes and procedures advocated by glaser and by strauss. to accomplish this task, the authors present the article in two sections. first, they provide relevant background information on grounded theory as a research method. second, they pursue a more in-depth discussion of the positions of glaser, using glaser's work, and strauss, using strauss's and strauss and corbin's (1990) work, regarding the different phases of data analysis, specifically addressing the coding procedures, verification, and the issue of forcing versus emergence.
nkt cells are key mediators of antiviral and anticancer immunity. experiments in mice have demonstrated that activation of nkt cells in vivo induces the expression of multiple effector molecules critical to successful immunity. human clinical trials have shown similar responses, although in vivo activation of nkt cells in humans or primate models are far more limited in number and scope. measuring ex vivo activation of nkt cells by the cd1d-restricted glycolipid ligand α-galactosylceramide (α-galcer) through cytokine expression profiles is a useful marker of nkt cell function, but for reasons that are unclear, this approach does not appear to work as well in humans and non-human primate macaque models in comparison to mice. we performed a series of experiments on human and macaque (macaca nemestrina) fresh whole blood samples to define optimal conditions to detect nkt cell cytokine (tnf, ifnγ, il-2) and degranulation marker (cd107a) expression by flow cytometry. we found that conditions previously described for mouse splenocyte nkt cell activation were suboptimal on human or macaque blood nkt cells. in contrast, a 6h incubation with brefeldin a added for the last 4h, in a 96-well plate based assay, and using an α-galcer concentration of 1 μg/ml were optimal methods to stimulate nkt cells in fresh blood from both humans and macaques. unexpectedly, we noted that blood nkt cells from macaques infected with siv were more readily activated by α-galcer than nkt cells from uninfected macaques, suggesting that siv infection may have primed the nkt cells. in conclusion, we describe optimized methods for the ex vivo antigen-specific activation of human and macaque blood nkt cells. these assays should be useful in monitoring nkt cells in disease and in immunotherapy studies. flow cytometry has become a powerful technique to measure intracellular cytokine production in lymphocytes and monocytes. appropriate inhibition of the secretion of the produced cytokines is required for studying intracellular cytokine expression. the aim of this study was to compare the capacity of cytokine secretion inhibitors, monensin and brefeldin a, in order to trap cytokine production (interleukin-1 beta [il-1beta], il-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [tnf-alpha]) within peripheral blood monocytes. a two-color flow cytometric technique was used to measure intracellular spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha production in monocytes (cd14+) of whole blood cultures. the viability of monensin-treated monocytes was slightly lower than that of brefeldin a-inhibited monocytes, as measured with propidium iodide (pi). the percentage of il-6 and tnf-alpha-producing monocytes after 8 h of culture without stimulation revealed significant lower values for monensin-treated than for brefeldin a-treated monocytes. the percentages for stimulated cells did not differ. the spontaneous intracellular production in molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome units (mesf) of il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha after 8 h of culture was higher in brefeldin a than in monensin-inhibited monocytes. the lps-stimulated intracellular production of il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha was increased in brefeldin a-inhibited monocytes. in conclusion, for flow cytometric determination of intracellular monocytic cytokines (il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha), brefeldin a is a more potent, effective, and less toxic inhibitor of cytokine secretion than monensin.
medical records of 16 cats diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (epi) were reviewed. the diagnosis was confirmed with either a serum feline trypsin-like immunoreactivity (ftli) concentration ≤12 μg/l or a fecal proteolytic activity (fpa) <6 mm for three consecutive days. the majority of cats were castrated male domestic shorthairs. the median age of cats affected was 7 years. the most common clinical sign was weight loss followed by diarrhea, polyphagia and vomiting. concurrent disease was present in 10/16 (63%) cats. the most common laboratory abnormalities were normocytic normochromic anemia, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, increased alanine transferase activity, hyperglycemia and increased bilirubin concentrations. all 10 cats that were tested for serum cobalamin levels were found to be deficient. all 10 cats that were tested for serum folate concentrations had normal or increased levels. ten out of 11 cats had at least a partial response to treatment. all cats were discharged from the hospital alive. results suggest that epi should be considered a differential diagnosis in any cat with weight loss or poor growth after more common diseases have been ruled out. concurrent disease is common in feline epi. cobalamin deficiency is common in cats with epi and cats should receive cobalamin supplementation to improve response to treatment. cats in this study had a good prognosis. hypocobalaminaemia in cats has previously been identified, but the incidence reported has varied, and the frequency of folate deficiency is unknown. the aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence of low cobalamin and folate levels in a population of cats that were suffering predominantly from diseases of the alimentary tract (including the liver and pancreas) and to ascertain whether severity of disease (as assessed by bodyweight and body condition score (bcs)) related to degree of deficiency. the study population comprised 103 cats, of which 16.5% had low cobalamin levels and 38.8% had low folate levels. a serendipitous finding was inorganic phosphate levels below the reference range in 48% of the cases. significant associations were found between subnormal cobalamin levels and median bcs (p=0.049); combined low folate and low cobalamin and bodyweight (p=0.002), bcs (p=0.024) and inorganic phosphate levels (p=0.003). the finding of low levels of folate and cobalamin in clinical cases suggests that supplementation may be indicated more frequently than is currently recognised.
abstract the distribution of sulfur isotopes in geological materials reveals information about earth history and biogeochemical processes. research during the last several decades has used sulfur isotope geochemistry as a tool to better understand microbial processes ( harrison and thode, 1958 , kaplan, 1975 , monster et al., 1979 , peck, 1959 , peck, 1962 , rees, 1973 ) and sediment diagenesis ( berner, 1969 , berner, 1982 , canfield et al., 1993b ). earth historians also realized this potential, as there exists a rich record of environmental change within the sedimentary records ( canfield and teske, 1996 , claypool et al., 1980 , goodwin et al., 1976 , habicht et al., 2002 , kah et al., 2004 , monster et al., 1979 , shen et al., 2001 , strauss, 1993 , thode and goodwin, 1983 ). these applications have championed the use of the two most abundant sulfur isotopes [32s and 34s], and provide a rich introduction to what the sulfur isotope record has to offer [see ( canfield, 2004 , canfield and raiswell, 1999 )]. within the last decade, this information has been supplemented by new data derived from the less abundant isotopes [33s and 36s]. the measurement of all four stable sulfur isotopes – multiple sulfur isotope geochemistry – has expanded our understanding of biological evolution and activity, atmospheric chemistry and transport, crustal recycling, and many more fields related to earth surface processes [see ( farquhar and wing, 2003 )]. here, i present a review of recent works in multiple sulfur isotope geochemistry with a focus on results that inform our understanding of biogeochemical processes and earth surface evolution. abstract the mass-dependent fractionation laws that describe the partitioning of isotopes are different for kinetic and equilibrium reactions. these laws are characterized by the exponent relating the fractionation factors for two isotope ratios such that α2/1 = α3/1β. the exponent β for equilibrium exchange is (1/m1 − 1/m2)/(1/m1 − 1/m3), where mi are the atomic masses and m1
the pharmacological properties of cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, {2-[4-(2-bromo-5-methoxybenzyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl}-(2-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)amide (rec 27/0224), and cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, (2-methoxy-phenyl)-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]ethyl}amide (rec 27/0074), were characterized using radioligand displacement and guanosine 5′-o-(3-[35s]thiotriphosphate) ([35s]gtpγs) binding assays, as well as electrophysiological experiments, in rat hippocampal and dorsal raphe nucleus (drn) slices. both compounds showed a high affinity (ki, ∼1 nm) and selectivity (>70-fold) at human 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)1a receptors versus other 5-ht receptors. in [35s]gtpγs binding assays on hela cells stably expressing human 5-ht1a receptors, rec 27/0224 and rec 27/0074 inhibited basal [35s]gtpγs binding by 44.8 ± 1.7% (pec50 = 8.58) and 25 ± 2.5% (pec50 = 8.86), respectively. in intracellularly recorded ca1 pyramidal cells, 5-ht1a (hetero)receptor-mediated hyperpolarization, elicited by 100 nm 5-carboxamidoytryptamine (5-ct), was partially antagonized by rec 27/0224 (∼50%; ic50 = 18.0 nm) and rec 27/0074 (74%; ic50 = 0.8 nm). in extracellularly recorded drn serotonergic neurons, rec 27/0224 and rec 27/0074 fully antagonized the inhibition of firing caused by the activation of 5-ht1a (auto)receptors by 30 nm 5-ct with an ic50 of 34.9 nm and 16.5 nm, respectively. the antagonism had a slow time course, reaching a steady state within 60 min. both compounds also antagonized the citalopram-elicited, endogenous 5-ht-mediated inhibition of cell firing. in conclusion, rec 27/0224 and rec 27/0074 exhibited inverse agonism in [35s]gtpγs binding assays and differential antagonistic properties on 5-ht1a receptor-mediated responses in the hippocampus but not in the drn. whether this differential effect is causally related to inverse agonist activity is unclear. the qualitatively different nature of the antagonism in the hippocampus versus the drn clearly distinguishes the compounds from neutral antagonists, such as n-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl}-n-2-pyridinylcyclo-hexanecarboxamide (way-100635). 1 the acute inhibitory effect of selective 5‐hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) reuptake inhibitors (ssris) on 5‐ht neuronal activity may offset their ability to increase synaptic 5‐ht in the forebrain. 2here, we determined the effects of the ssri, paroxetine, and a novel selective 5‐ht1a receptor antagonist, way 100635, on 5‐ht cell firing in the dorsal raphe nucleus (drn), and on extracellular 5‐ht in both the drn and the frontal cortex (fcx). extracellular electrophysiological recording and brain microdialysis were used in parallel experiments, in anaesthetized rats. 3 paroxetine dose‐dependently inhibited the firing of 5‐ht neurones in the drn, with a maximally effective dose of approximately 0.8 mg kg−1, i.v. way 100635 (0.1 mg kg−1, i.v.) both reversed the inhibitory effect of paroxetine and, when used as a pretreatment, caused a pronounced shift to the right of the paroxetine dose‐response curve. 4 paroxetine (0.8 mg kg−1, i.v.), doubled extracellular 5‐ht in the drn, but did not alter extracellular 5‐ht in the fcx. a higher dose of paroxetine (2.4 mg kg−1, i.v.) did increase extracellular 5‐ht in the fcx, but to a lesser extent than in the drn. whereas 0.8 mg kg−1, i.v. paroxetine alone had no effect on extracellular 5‐ht in the fcx, in rats pretreated with way 100635 (0.1 mg kg−1), paroxetine (0.8 mg kg−1, i.v.) markedly increased extracellular 5‐ht in the fcx. 5 in conclusion, pretreatment with the selective 5‐ht1a receptor antagonist, way 100635, blocked the inhibitory effect of paroxetine on 5‐ht neuronal activity in the drn and, at the same time, markedly enhanced the effect of paroxetine on extracellular 5‐ht in the fcx. these results may be relevant to recent clinical observations that 5‐ht1a receptor antagonists in combination with ssris have a rapid onset of antidepressant effect.
background to determine the effect of different statins on the induction of diabetes mellitus. materials and methods four statins (atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin) were used. cytotoxicity, insulin secretion, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and g0/g1 phase cell cycle arrest were investigated in human pancreas islet β cells, and glucose uptake and signaling were studied in human skeletal muscle cells (hskmcs). results human pancreas islet β cells treated with 100 nm atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin had reduced cell viability (32.12%, 41.09%, 33.96%, and 29.19%, respectively) compared to controls. such cytotoxic effect was significantly attenuated by decreasing the dose to 10 and 1 nm, ranged from 1.46% to 17.28%. cells treated with 100 nm atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin had a reduction in the rate of insulin secretion rate by 34.07%, 30.06%, 26.78%, and 19.22%, respectively. the inhibitory effect was slightly attenuated by decreasing the dose to 10 and 1 nm, ranging from 10.84% to 29.60%. insulin secretion stimulated by a high concentration of glucose (28 mmol/l) was significantly higher than a physiologic concentration of glucose (5.6 mmol/l) in all treatment groups. the glucose uptake rates at a concentration of 100 nm were as follows: atorvastatin (58.76%) < pravastatin (60.21%) < rosuvastatin (72.54%) < pitavastatin (89.96%). we also found that atorvastatin and pravastatin decreased glucose transporter (glut)-2 expression and induced p-p38 mapk levels in human pancreas islet β cells. atorvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin inhibited glut-4, p-akt, p-gsk-3β, and p-p38 mapk levels in hskmcs. conclusion statins similar but different degree of effects on pancreas islet β cells damage and induce insulin resistance in hskmc. many anecdotal reports have suggested that therapy with hmg-coa reductase inhibitors (‘statins’) can cause acute pancreatitis. we aimed to quantify the association between statins and pancreatitis and to classify the adverse effect under the dose, time, susceptibility (dots) system.we searched for controlled observational studies that assessed the risk of pancreatitis in patients receiving statins. in order to identify case reports of statin-induced pancreatitis, we looked for reports published in scientific journals and manually reviewed reports within the canadian adverse drug event monitoring system (cadrmp) database.two observational studies were identified and the data pooled together in a meta-analysis. this yielded an odds ratio of 1.41 (95% ci 1.15, 1.74) for the risk of acute pancreatitis in patients with a past history of exposure to statins. we also identified 20 published case reports and 33 spontaneous reports from the cadrmp database. these data showed that pancreatitis can occur at both high and low doses, with 12 cases developing pancreatitis at less than the dose equivalent of simvastatin 20mg daily. statin-induced pancreatitis can occur at any time but seems to be very uncommon early on and more likely to occur after many months of therapy. there does not appear to be a cumulative dose effect and increasing age does not appear to be a major susceptibility factor. these finding should help clinicians to better manage and diagnose patients who are at risk of statin-induced pancreatitis.
the aim of this study was to investigate the management and prognostic determinants of recurrent pleomorphic adenoma (rpa). a retrospective analysis was performed to examine the clinical features, the prevalence of surgical complications, and new recurrences of rpa. tumor recurrence rate was estimated by the kaplan–meier method, and the prognostic value of some of the variables was tested by univariate analysis using the log rank test. the study focused on 33 patients, 18 female (54.5%) and 15 male (45.5%), aged 12–71 years (median 41). a total or extended total parotidectomy was performed in 16 cases (48.5%), a superficial parotidectomy in 10 cases (30.3%), and a local excision in 7 cases (21.2%). in ten patients (30.3%), a branch or the trunk of the facial nerve was deliberately sacrificed. major complications included one unexpected definitive paralysis of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve and 14 cases of frey syndrome. follow-up varied from 2 to 25 years (median 10.5 years), and there were 11 new recurrences (33.3%) within a period varying from 1 to 16 years (median 6 years). the estimated tumor recurrence rates were 14.1 ± 6.6% at 5 years, 31.4 ± 9.4% at 10 years, 43.0 ± 10.8% at 15 years, and 57.2 ± 14.8% at 20 years. presence of a multinodular lesion and the type of intervention performed were significantly associated with a higher probability of recurrence. rpas are prone to new recurrences, especially when multinodular and treated with a local excision. surgical treatment should include facial nerve resection in selected cases. follow-up for the patient’s lifetime is warranted. surgery for recurrent parotid pleomorphic adenoma is a challenging problem.
low efficiency of chemotherapy in ovarian cancer results from the development of drug resistance. cisplatin (cis) and topotecan (top) are drugs used in chemotherapy of this cancer. we analyzed the development of cis and top resistance in ovarian cancer cell lines. incubation of drug sensitive cell lines (w1 and a2780) with cytostatic drugs was used to determine the primary response to cis and top. quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr) was performed to measure the expression levels of the genes. we observed decreased expression of the mctp1 gene in all resistant cell lines. we observed overexpression of the s100a3 and herc5 genes in top-resistant cell lines. increased expression of the s100a3 gene was also observed in cis-resistant a2780 sublines. overexpression of the c4orf18 gene was observed in cis- and top-resistant a2780 sublines. a short time of exposure to cis led to increased expression of the abcc2 gene in the w1 and a2780 cell lines and increased expression of the c4orf18 gene in the a2780 cell line. a short time of exposure to top led to increased expression of the s100a3 and herc5 genes in both sensitive cell lines, increased expression of the c4orf18 gene in the a2780 cell line and downregulation of the mctp1 gene in the w1 cell line. our results suggest that changes in expression of the mctp1, s100a3 and c4orf18 genes may be related to both cis and top resistance. increased expression of the herc5 gene seems to be important only in top resistance. epidermal differentiation complex (edc) comprises a number of genes associated with human skin diseases including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and hyperkeratosis. these genes have also been linked to numerous cancers, among them skin, gastric, colorectal, lung, ovarian and renal carcinomas. the involvement of edc components encoding s100 proteins, small proline-rich proteins (sprrs) and other genes in the tumorigenesis of head and neck squamous cell cancer (hnscc) has been previously suggested. the aim of the study was to systematically analyze the expression of edc components on the transcript level in hnscc. tissue specimens from 93 patients with hnc of oral cavity and 87 samples from adjacent or distant grossly normal oral mucosawere analyzed. 48 samples (24 tumor and 24 corresponding surrounding tissue) were hybridized to affymetrix genechip human 1.0 st arrays. for validation by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) the total rna from all180 samples collected in the study was analyzed with real-time pcr system and fluorescent amplicon specific-probes. additional set of samples from 14 patients with laryngeal carcinoma previously obtained by hg-u133 plus 2.0 microarray was also included in the analyses. the expression of analyzed edc genes was heterogeneous. two transcripts (s100a1 and s100a4) were significantly down-regulated in oral cancer when compared to normal mucosa (0.69 and 0.36-fold change, respectively), showing an opposite pattern of expression to the remaining s100 genes. significant up-regulation in tumors was found for s100a11, s100a7, lce3d, s100a3 and s100a2 genes. the increased expression of s100a7 was subsequently validated by qpcr, confirming significant differences. the remaining edc genes, including all encoding sprr molecules, did not show any differences between oral cancer and normal mucosa. the observed differences were also assessed in the independent set of laryngeal cancer samples, confirming the role of s100a3 and lce3d transcripts in hnc. in hnc of oral cavity only one family of edc genes (s100 proteins) showed significant cancer-related differences. a number of other transcripts which showed altered expression in hnc require further validation.
several studies have shown that trnas can be enzymatically cleaved to generate distinct classes of trna-derived fragments (trf). here, we report that trf/mir-1280, a 17-bp fragment derived from trnaleu and pre-mirna, influences notch signaling pathways that support the function of cancer stem-like cells (csc) in colorectal cancer progression. trf/mir-1280 expression was decreased in human specimens of colorectal cancer. ectopic expression of trf/mir-1280 reduced cell proliferation and colony formation, whereas its suppression reversed these effects. mechanistic investigations implicated the notch ligand jag2 as a direct target of trf/mir-1280 binding through which it reduced tumor formation and metastasis. notably, trf/mir-1280-mediated inactivation of notch signaling suppressed csc phenotypes, including by direct transcriptional repression of the gata1/3 and mir-200b genes. these results were consistent with findings of decreased levels of mir-200b and elevated levels of jag2, gata1, gata3, zeb1, and suz12 in colorectal cancer tissue specimens. taken together, our results established that trf/mir-1280 suppresses colorectal cancer growth and metastasis by repressing notch signaling pathways that support csc phenotypes. furthermore, they provide evidence that functionally active mirna can be derived from trna, offering potential biomarker and therapeutic uses. cancer res; 77(12); 3194-206. ©2017 aacr. gata binding protein 3 (gata3) is a transcriptional activator highly expressed by the luminal epithelial cells in the breast. here we did a meta-analysis of the available breast cancer cdna data sets on a cohort of 305 patients and found that gata3 was one of the top genes with low expression in invasive carcinomas with poor clinical outcome. to validate its prognostic utility, we did a tissue microarray analysis on a cohort of 139 consecutive invasive carcinomas (n = 417 tissue samples) immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against gata3. low gata3 expression was associated with higher histologic grade (p < 0.001), positive nodes (p = 0.002), larger tumor size (p = 0.03), negative estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (p < 0.001 for both), and her2-neu overexpression (p = 0.03). patients whose tumors expressed low gata3 had significantly shorter overall and disease-free survival when compared with those whose tumors had high gata3 levels. the hazard ratio of metastasis or recurrence according to the gata3 status was 0.31 (95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.74; p = 0.009). cox multivariate analysis showed that gata3 had independent prognostic significance above and beyond conventional variables. our data suggest that immunohistochemical analysis of gata3 may be the basis for a new clinically applicable test to predict tumor recurrence early in the progression of breast cancer.
bananas in thailand have been surveyed by our team to be at least 140 cultivars in the plantations, 10 wild species and, 4 introduced species. to characterize the genetic relationship of species and cultivars, a set of novel ssr markers was developed. totaling 53 clones containing ssr motifs were isolated from ssr-enriched library of wild musa balbisiana colla ‘tani’ (bb). selected positive clones were used to design 28 primer pairs for amplification of 12 wild and 82 cultivar accessions with genome designations aa, ab, aaa, aab, abb, and bbb. these ssr markers loci were homology searched to the banana genomes to map their locations. the seven-sets multiplex pcr approach using four fluorescent-labeled universal primers were utilized for cost effectiveness. capillary fragment analysis yielded the accurate size of amplicons for evaluation of particular patterns for each cultivar. phylogram and structure analysis presented the specific genotype of genome groups (a and b genotypes, polyploid hybrid genomes) and cultivar groups. by a:b specific alleles ratio, accurate genome designations of hybrids can be determined. additionally, a marker, characterized to be partial plastid ycf2 gene, indicated the maternal identification of hybrid cultivars. one ssr marker was also preliminary tested with some wild species and advised to be the candidate fingerprinting marker for species identification. in conclusion, ssr marker sets developed here proved their exploitation in detailed identity and relationship of cultivated bananas, which would be useful for genetic conservation and ongoing breeding programs in thailand and other areas. directly labelling locus‐specific primers for microsatellite analysis is expensive and a common limitation to small‐budget molecular ecology projects. more cost‐effective end‐labelling of pcr products can be achieved through a three primer pcr approach, involving a fluorescently labelled universal primer in combination with modified locus‐specific primers with 5′ universal primer sequence tails. this technique has been widely used but has been limited largely due to a lack of available universal primers suitable for co‐amplifying large numbers of size overlapping loci and without requiring locus‐specific pcr conditions to be modified. in this study, we report a suite of four high‐performance universal primers that can be employed in a three primer pcr approach for efficient and cost‐effective fluorescent end‐labelling of pcr fragments. amplification efficiency is maximized owing to high universal primer tm values (approximately 60+ °c) that enhance primer versatility and enable higher annealing temperatures to be employed compared with commonly used universal primers such as m13. we demonstrate that these universal primers can be combined with multiple fluorophores to co‐amplify multiple loci efficiently via multiplex pcr. this method provides a level of multiplexing and pcr efficiency similar to microsatellite fluorescent detection assays using directly labelled primers while dramatically reducing project costs. primer performance is tested using several alternative pcr strategies that involve both single and multiple fluorophores in single and multiplex pcr across a wide range of taxa.
beta-catenin accumulation is suppressed by tgf-beta1 (transforming growth factor beta1) in intestinal epithelium suggesting negative feedback between these two factors. besides that, beta-catenin interacts with hif-1alpha (hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha) at the promoter region of hif-1 target genes. our study was aimed at comparison of beta-catenin with hif-1alpha, tgf-beta1, ki67 and survival of sporadic colorectal cancer patients. expressions of beta-catenin, tgf-beta1, hif-1alpha, ki67 were evaluated in triads of specimens of each primary tumor of 72 sporadic colorectal cancers with immunohistochemistry due to limited availability of tissue material. disease-free survival was analyzed in case of all 100 beta-catenin stained tumors, in 85 cancers stained for hif-1 and in 72 neoplasms with tgfbeta1 staining. beta-catenin, tgf-beta1 and hif-1alpha accumulated in 72 colorectal cancer cells. beta-catenin correlated both with hif-1alpha and tgf-beta1 in all colorectal cancers (p < 0.009, r = 0.307 and p = 0.003, r = 0.342, respectively) and in subgroups of different clinico-pathological profile. beta-catenin failed to correlate with ki67. in case of beta-catenin, tgf-beta1 and hif-1alpha, disease-free survival curves failed to show any statistically significant differences between groups of marker negative tumors, cancers with low expression and neoplasms with higher protein expression. positive correlations between beta-catenin and tgf-beta1 may indicate ineffective attempts of tgf-beta1 to reduce intracellular level of beta-catenin in colorectal cancer. associations between beta-catenin and hif-1alpha reflect previously detected interactions between hif-1alpha with beta-catenin and are confirmative for presence of such reactions in human colorectal cancer. nuclear beta-catenin and cd133 are linked with two hallmarks of colon cancer, wingless-type mouse mammary tumour virus integration site (wnt)-pathway dysregulation and colon cancer stem cells (co-cscs), respectively. both molecules may be related, as co-cscs were proposed to require activated wnt-signalling and as cd133 was postulated as a wnt/beta-catenin target gene. herein, we investigated the expression of these markers on serial sections of 162 stage iia colonic adenocarcinomas. we found that the expression of these molecules is statistically independent and that they mark distinct but overlapping subpopulations of the tumour cells. moreover, we show that their combined evaluation can identify colon cancer cases with vastly reduced survival (hazard ratio (hr) 13.4, 95% confidence interval (ci): 4.7-38.2) and a high risk of tumour progression (hr 6.8, 95%ci: 3.1-15.0). in conclusion, the independence of these markers may on the one hand have implications for their presumed value to identify co-cscs; on the other hand it allows their combined analysis to become a powerful tool to identify high risk cases of stage iia colon cancer.
postnatal descent of the hyoid and larynx relative to the palate and mandible, which occurs uniquely in humans, is an anatomical prerequisite for quantal speech. this study tested the hypothesis that spatial constraints related to deglutition impose greater restrictions on the rate and degree of hyo-laryngeal descent than do adaptations for vocalization. ontogenetic data on changes in the size and shape of the pharynx, the vocal tract, and the spatial positions of the larynx, hyoid, mandible and hard palate relative to each other and to the oral cavity were obtained for 15 males and 13 females from a longitudinal series of lateral radiographs (the denver growth study) taken between the ages of 1 month and 14 years. to establish growth patterns, nine linear dimensions of the pharynx and 15 different pharyngeal and vocal-tract proportions were regressed against percentage growth. the results demonstrate that certain aspects of vocal-tract shape change markedly during ontogeny, especially in the first postnatal year and during the adolescent growth spurt. the ratio of pharynx height to oral cavity length (which is important for speech) decreases significantly (p<0.001) from 1.5 to 1.0 between birth and 6-8 years, after which it remains stable. in contrast, regression analyses indicated that superoinferior spatial relations between the positions of the vocal folds, the hyoid body, the mandible and the hard palate do not change significantly throughout the entire postnatal growth period (p<0.05). sexual dimorphism in pharyngeal shape and size before the age of 14 years is very limited. the results suggest that the descent of the hyoid and larynx relative to the mandible is constrained by muscle function related to deglutition, highlighting the different functional roles of the hyoid during speech and oral transport. children with craniofacial syndromes, especially those with midfacial hypoplasia, micrognathia, or deformation of the cranial base, are frequently suffering from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (osas). it is important to recognize this condition. diagnostic methods and therapeutic developments are discussed. experience with 31 patients in the sophia children's hospital is presented. the majority of these infants suffered from moderate or severe osas. treatment varied from symptomatic (e.g. continuous positive airway pressure) to curative. these therapies could often prevent a tracheotomy. still more curative treatment options are needed.
background few studies assessing the relationship between active and passive smoking and tuberculosis have used biomarkers to measure smoke exposure. we sought to determine the association between active and passive smoking and ltbi in a representative sample of us adults and children. methods we used the 1999–2000 us national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes) dataset with tuberculin skin test (tst) data to assess the association between cotinine-confirmed smoke exposure and latent tuberculosis infection (ltbi) among adults ages ≥20 years (n = 3598) and children 3–19 years (n = 2943) and estimate the prevalence of smoke exposure among those with ltbi. weighted multivariate logistic regression was used to measure the associations between active and passive smoking and ltbi. results ltbi prevalence in 1999–2000 among cotinine-confirmed active, passive, and non-smoking adults and children was 6.0%, 5.2%, 3.3% and 0.3%, 1.0%, 1.5%, respectively. this corresponds to approximately 3,556,000 active and 3,379,000 passive smoking adults with ltbi in the us civilian non-institutionalized population in 1999–2000. controlling for age, gender, socioeconomic status, race, birthplace (us vs. foreign-born), household size, and having ever lived with someone with tb, adult active smokers were significantly more likely to have ltbi than non-smoking adults (aor = 2.31 95% ci 1.17–4.55). adult passive smokers also had a greater odds of ltbi compared with non-smokers, but this association did not achieve statistical significance (aor = 2.00 95% ci 0.87–4.60). neither active or passive smoking was associated with ltbi among children. among only the foreign-born adults, both active (aor = 2.56 (95% ci 1.20–5.45) and passive smoking (aor = 2.27 95% ci 1.09–4.72) were significantly associated with ltbi. conclusions active adult smokers and both foreign-born active and passive smokers in the united states are at elevated risk for ltbi. targeted smoking prevention and cessation programs should be included in comprehensive national and international tb control efforts. the influence of tobacco smoke on human health is still an important problem worldwide. complex inflammatory processes and changes in the immune system are crucial in the pathogenesis of smoking related disorders like chronic obstructive lung disease (copd), lung cancer, atherosclerosis. the objective of this review is to present the alterations in the immune system in smokers. the main affected system by cigarette smoke (cs) is the respiratory tract. in bronchial epithelium metaplastic and dysplastic changes are accompanied by elevated expression of adhesion molecules and secretion of many cytokines capable of stimulation immune cells influx. in the population of pulmonary macrophages an elevated proportion of cells, changes in expression surface markers with impaired phagocytic and antigen presenting function are observed. chronic exposure to cs causes increased production of metalloproteinases (mmp) by macrophages and proteolitic enzymes by neutrophils. these enzymes cause destruction of alveolar wall. increased apoptosis of lung tissue results in augmentation of foreign material which may play a role of autoantigen and which is a target for cytotoxic/suppressor cells. the role of regulatory t (treg) cells in this process is recently postulated. smoking cessation is the most effective method of prophylaxis and treatment of diseases related to tobacco smoking. however many immunological changes in smokers are not completely reversible after quitting smoking.
vibrio vulnificus, a bacterial species that inhabits brackish waters, is an opportunistic pathogen of humans. v. vulnificus infections can cause acute gastroenteritis, invasive septicemia, tissue necrosis, and potentially death. virulence factors associated with v. vulnificus include the capsular polysaccharide (cps), lipopolysaccharide, flagellum, pili, and outer membrane vesicles (omvs). the aims of this study were to characterize the morphology of v. vulnificus cells and the formation and arrangement of omvs using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-em). cryo-em and cryo-electron tomography imaging of v. vulnificus strains grown in liquid cultures revealed the presence of omvs (diameters of ∼45 nm for wild-type, ∼30 nm for the unencapsulated mutant, and ∼50 nm for the non-motile mutant) in log-phase growth. production of omvs in the stationary growth phase was limited and irregular. the spacing of the omvs around the wild-type cells was in regular, concentric rings. in wild-type cells and a non-motile mutant, the spacing between the cell envelope and the first ring of omvs was ∼200 nm; this spacing was maintained between subsequent omv layers. the size, arrangement, and spacing of omvs in an unencapsulated mutant was irregular and indicated that the polysaccharide chains of the capsule regulate aspects of omv production and order. together, our results revealed the distinctive organization of v. vulnificus omvs that is affected by expression of the cps. background. vibrio cholerae excreted by cholera patients is “hyperinfectious” (hi), which can be modeled by passage through infant mice. immunization of adult female mice with v. cholerae outer-membrane vesicles (omvs) passively protects suckling mice from challenge. although v. cholerae is unable to colonize protected pups, the bacteria survive passage and have the potential to be transmitted to susceptible individuals. here, we investigated the impact of omv immunization and the hi state on v. cholerae transmission. methods. neonatal mice suckled by omv- or sham-immunized dams were challenged with hi v. cholerae. the infectivity of spatially and temporally separate v. cholerae populations obtained from infected naive or protected pups was tested. recombination-based in vivo expression technology was used to assess virulence gene expression within these populations. results. omv immunization significantly reduced colonization of neonates challenged with hi v. cholerae. vibrio cholerae that had colonized the naive host was hi, whereas v. cholerae excreted by neonates born to omv-immunized dams, although viable, was hypoinfectious and failed to fully induce virulence gene expression. conclusions. omv immunization can significantly reduce the v. cholerae burden upon challenge with hi v. cholerae and can also block transmission from immune mice by reducing the infectivity of shed bacteria.
dietary patterns are important in the prevention of chronic disease; however, there are few studies that include repeat measures of dietary patterns. the objective of this study was to assess the relations between dietary patterns during adult life (at ages 36, 43, and 53 y) and risk factors for chronic disease at age 53 y. participants of a longitudinal study of health completed a 5-d food diary at 3 occasions during adult life (n = 1265). factor analysis was used to identify dietary patterns and a pattern score was calculated from the consumption of the food items in each dietary pattern. means and 95% ci for dietary pattern scores were calculated for each risk factor category using random effects models adjusted for socio-demographic and health-related behaviors. in women, the fruit, vegetables, and dairy pattern was inversely associated with bmi (p < 0.004), waist circumference (p = 0.0007), blood pressure (p = 0.02), and was positively associated with red cell folate (p < 0.03). the ethnic foods and alcohol pattern was also inversely associated with blood pressure (p = 0.008), whereas the meat, potatoes and sweet foods pattern was positively associated with glycated hemoglobin (p = 0.01). in men, a mixed pattern was inversely associated with waist circumference (p = 0.02) and blood pressure (p = 0.01), whereas there were no significant associations with the ethnic foods and alcohol pattern. specific dietary patterns throughout adult life were associated with chronic disease risk factors. this book provides a practical introduction to some important aspects of longitudinal data analysis for both observational and experimental studies. the definition of longitudinal data used, is where the same outcomes are measured at several different time points. the consequence of using this definition is that techniques using a single terminal event, such as death or onset of a chronic disease as their outcome, including survival analysis, are outside the scope of this book. this is not really a limitation, as it allows the book to focus on concepts and methods that are all too often overlooked by epidemiologists and other researchers conducting longitudinal research. increasingly, standard statistical software packages provide the resources to conduct truly longitudinal analyses as described in this book, so more epidemiologists should be using these techniques to get more from their longitudinal material. this book will appeal especially to those who would like to use more appropriate statistics for longitudinal analysis without having to work through their entire mathematical derivation. of course, no book on statistics would be complete without a few equations, but they are sparingly used and shouldn’t deter the mathematically challenged. an attractive feature is that examples are illustrated using output from the relevant software packages to aid interpretation of results and there is a section on software covering procedures in stata, sas, spss, s-plus and mlwin. after an introduction to some basic concepts in longitudinal research, the book goes on to discuss techniques for investigating the associations of predictive measures with outcomes at repeated time points. there are separate sections for continuous and dichotomous outcomes; beginning with simpler approaches and moving on to more sophisticated techniques. there is also some coverage of the potentially more complicated analyses using ordered categorical outcomes, that can be modelled using methods equivalent to polytomous or multinomial logistic regression. while some more basic and familiar methods are coved, the most comprehensively discussed techniques are generalised estimating equations and random coefficient analysis, which effectively provide equivalents of both linear and logistic regression for longitudinal data. why does longitudinal data analysis require methods such as generalised estimating equations and random coefficient analysis rather than other, more familiar, techniques? because the more basic techniques cannot capture and quantify the complex development of relationships between predictor and outcome variables over time, central to studies of many biological phenomena such as growth and age-dependent variation in blood pressure. this book offers practical advice on measuring associations that may change over time, where time is considered continuously or categorically and there is also coverage of time-lag effects. such a longitudinal approach allows investigation of variation both within subjects and between groups over time. quantification of the stability of associations over time can be undertaken and this can form part of an assessment for longitudinal development of disease risks. a problem that often plagues longitudinal research is that of missing values. of course this is a problem for cross sectional studies too, but repeated measures often compound difficulties associated with missing data. the book discusses methods to assess if patterns of missing data are independent of predictor or outcome variables and suggest some strategies to minimise their impact on the results, including imputation techniques. at present, many epidemiological researchers do not exploit fully their longitudinal data. this is because they employ cross-sectional techniques or methods that only poorly measure changing associations over time. most of this book is written in a style that will be understood by non-statisticians and it could encourage fuller use of longitudinal data by epidemiologists.
zika virus (zikv) is associated with numerous human health-related disorders, including fetal microcephaly, neurological signs, and autoimmune disorders such as guillain-barré syndrome (gbs). perceiving the zika associated losses, in 2016, the world health organization (who) declared it as a global public health emergency. in consequence, an upsurge in the research on zikv was seen around the globe, with significant attainments over developing several effective diagnostics, drugs, therapies, and vaccines countering this life-threatening virus at an early step. state-of-art tools developed led the researchers to explore virus at the molecular level, and in-depth epidemiological investigations to understand the reason for increased pathogenicity and different clinical manifestations. these days, zikv infection is diagnosed based on clinical manifestations, along with serological and molecular detection tools. as, isolation of zikv is a tedious task; molecular assays such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), real-time qrt-pcr, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp), lateral flow assays (lfas), biosensors, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (nasba) tests, strand invasion-based amplification tests and immune assays like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) are in-use to ascertain the zikv infection or zika fever. herein, this review highlights the recent advances in the diagnosis, surveillance, and monitoring of zikv. these new insights gained from the recent advances can aid in the rapid and definitive detection of this virus and/or zika fever. the summarized information will aid the strategies to design and adopt effective prevention and control strategies to counter this viral pathogen of great public health concern. rapid and accurate diagnosis of infectious agents is essential for patient care, disease control, and countermeasure development. the present serologic diagnosis of zika virus (zikv) infection relies mainly on igm-capture elisa which is confounded with the flaw of cross-reactivity among different flaviviruses. in this communication, we report a multiplex microsphere immunoassay (mia) that captures the diagnostic power of viral envelope protein (that elicits robust, yet cross-reactive antibodies to other flaviviruses) and the differential power of viral nonstructural proteins ns1 and ns5 (that induce more virus-type specific antibodies). using 153 patient specimens with known zikv and/or dengue virus (denv; a closely related flavivirus) infections, we showed that (i) zikv envelope-based mia is equivalent or more sensitive than igm-capture elisa in diagnosing zikv infection, (ii) antibody responses to ns1 and ns5 proteins are more zikv-specific than antibody response to envelope protein, (iii) inclusion of ns1 and ns5 in the mia improves the diagnostic accuracy when compared with the mia that uses envelope protein alone. the multiplex mia achieves a rapid diagnosis (turnaround time < 4 h) and requires small specimen volume (10 μl) in a single reaction. this serologic assay could be developed for use in clinical diagnosis of zikv infection and for monitoring immune responses in vaccine trials.
chemical neurotransmitters (nt) are principal actors in all neuronal networks of animals. the central nervous system plays an important role in stress susceptibility and organizes the response to a stressful situation through the interaction of the dopaminergic and the serotonergic pathways, leading to the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (hpa). this study was designed to investigate: a) the effects of stressful handling of pigs at the slaughterhouse on the neurotransmitter profile in four brain areas: amygdala, prefrontal cortex (pfc), hippocampus and hypothalamus, and b) whether the alterations in the brain nt profile after stressful handling were associated with fear, determined by the tonic immobility (ti) test. in the first place, the characterization of the nt profile allowed to distinguish the four brain areas in a principal component analysis. the most crucial pathway involved in the reaction of pigs to a stressful handling was the serotonergic system, and changes were observed in the amygdala with a decrease in serotonin (5-ht) and total indoleamines, and in the hippocampus, where this pathway was activated. fearful and non-fearful pigs did not show significant differences in their nt profile in control conditions, but when subjected to a stressful handling in the slaughterhouse, fearful animals showed a significant variation in the serotonin pathway and, in a lesser extent, the dopamine (da) pathway. in conclusion, the existence of an underlying biological trait - possibly fearfulness - may be involved in the pig's response toward stressful challenges, and the serotonergic system seems to play a central role in this response. the serotonin system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis play important roles in modulating fear and stress-coping characteristics. tonic immobility (ti) is a fear-related phenotype, and previously we have shown that broiler chickens showing short ti (sti) duration experience better growth performance and higher adaptability to stress. here, we sought to further elucidate the central mechanisms underlying the phenotypic differences between chickens showing sti and long ti duration, by comparing the hypothalamic expression of genes in the serotonergic system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis under basal and corticosterone-exposed situations. the sti broilers had significantly lower (p < 0.01) hypothalamic expression of serotonin reuptake transporter and serotonin receptor 1a. moreover, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 was expressed significantly lower in sti chickens at the level of both mrna (p < 0.01) and protein (p < 0.05). hypothalamic expression of glucocorticoid receptor (gr) mrna tended to be higher (p < 0.059) in long ti chickens, but the protein content was approximately 2 times higher (p < 0.01) in sti chickens. the uncoupled expression of gr mrna and protein was associated with significantly lower (p < 0.05) expression of gga-mir-181a, gga-mir-211, and gga-mir-22, which are predicted to target gr, in sti chickens. corticosterone administration reduced the mrna expression of postsynaptic serotonin receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1b (p = 0.059) and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7 (p < 0.05), yet significantly increased the protein content of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (p < 0.05). these results suggest that broilers of different ti phenotypes have a distinct pattern of hypothalamic expression of fear- and stress-related genes.
operant escape from nociceptive thermal stimulation of 13 long-evans rats was compared before and after lateral spinal hemisection, to determine whether this lesion configuration provides an appropriate preclinical model of the hyperalgesia that can be associated with human spinal cord injury. escape from 44 °c and from 47 °c stimulation was not affected following sham spinal surgery but was significantly reduced over 20 weeks of postoperative testing following lateral spinal hemisection. this result is opposite to previous reports of enhanced reflex withdrawal in response to thermal stimulation of rats following lateral spinal hemisection. in addition, the latency of reflexive lick/guard responses to 44 °c was increased and the duration of lick/guard responding was decreased in the present study (hyporeflexia). thus, previous assessments of simple withdrawal reflexes have described a hyperreflexia following lateral spinal hemisection that was not replicated by lick/guard testing, and postoperative escape responding revealed hypoalgesia rather than the increased pain sensitivity expected in a model of chronic pain. the mechanisms underlying central pain following spinal cord injury (sci) are unsettled. the purpose of the present study was to examine differences in spinothalamic tract function below injury level and evoked pain in incomplete sci patients with neuropathic pain below injury level (central pain) versus those without such pain. a clinical examination, quantitative sensory testing and magnetic resonance imaging (mri) were performed in 10 sci patients with below-level pain and in 11 sci patients without neuropathic pain. patients with and without pain had similar reductions of mechanical and thermal detection thresholds below injury level. sci patients with central pain had sensory hypersensitivity in dermatomes corresponding to the lesion level more frequently than sci patients without pain, but this may in part be explained by the exclusion of at-level spontaneous pain in the pain-free group. the rostral-caudal extent of the lesion measured by mri did not differ between the two patient groups, and there were no statistically significant differences in any of the predefined areas of interest on the axial plane images. this study suggests that neuronal hyperexcitability plays a key role in central sci pain and furthermore - in contrast to previous findings - that loss of spinothalamic functions does not appear to be a predictor for central neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury.
objective: to assess the role of diet and vitamin or mineral supplements in renal cell carcinoma (rcc) risk. methods: mailed questionnaires were completed by 1279 (691 male and 588 female) newly diagnosed histologically confirmed rcc cases and 5370 (2696 male and 2674 female) population controls between 1994 and 1997 in eight canadian provinces. measurement included information on socioeconomic status, smoking habits, alcohol use, diet, and vitamin or mineral supplements. odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) were derived through unconditional logistic regression. results: a significant inverse association with rcc was observed with increasing total consumption of vegetables and vegetable juices for males and females combined. increased consumption for two specific vegetable groups was inversely associated among females but not males: for females, the adjusted ors for the highest quartile of consumption compared with the lowest were 0.5 (95% ci = 0.4–0.7) and 0.6 (95% ci = 0.4–0.8), p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0002 for dark-green vegetables and cruciferous vegetables, respectively. an increased risk was observed (for males and females combined) with increased consumption of hamburger and sausage: adjusted ors for highest level versus lowest level were 1.4 (95% ci = 1.1–1.8) and 1.5 (95% ci=1.2–2.0), respectively, p = 0.003 and 0.01. beef, pork or lamb as a main dish and processed meats were also associated with increased rcc. red meats and processed meats had a positive association with rcc among males who had smoked or were overweight; among females this was the case for hamburger only. significant inverse associations were observed for females taking vitamin e or calcium supplements. among males, those taking vitamin e or iron for more than 5years had reduced risks. conclusions: our findings add to the evidence that diet may play an important role in the etiology of rcc; the risk of rcc may be reduced by changes in nutritional habits. the role of diet in the aetiology of renal cell carcinoma was investigated in a population-based case-control study in denmark. cases were 20-79 years old, with a histologically verified diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. controls were sampled from the general population and were frequency-matched on age and sex. a total of 351 cases (73% of the eligible) and 340 controls (68% of the eligible) were included in the study. dietary information was obtained in a self-administered food frequency questionnaire and the information was confirmed in a subsequent interview performed by trained interviewers who also elicited information on other suspected risk factors such as smoking, occupation, medical history, education and reproductive history. logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios, and, both frequency of consumption of various food stuffs and computed nutrients were examined. a positive association was observed between risk of renal cell carcinoma and total energy intake (odds ratio, or, for highest quartile compared to lowest: 1.7 (95% confidence interval, ci, 1.0-3.0) for men, and 3.5 (95% ci 1.6-6.5) for women), fat intake (or for highest quartile compared to lowest: 1.9 (95% ci 1.1-3.5) for men, and 3.3 (95% ci 1.6-6.9) for women). for women, an effect was also seen for intake of carbohydrates (or for highest quartile compared to lowest: 3.2 (95% ci 1.5-6.8), while no protective effect was seen for vegetables or fruit. dairy products may be associated with risk of renal cell cancer (or for women using thickly spread butter compared to thinly spread: 11.4 (95% ci 2.8-45), or for women who drank more than one glass of milk with 3.5% fat content compared to never drink milk: 3.7 (95% ci 1.2-11). as expected, total energy intake, intake of fat, protein and carbohydrates were closely correlated making it difficult to identify one of the energy sources as more closely associated with risk of renal cell cancer than the other. several energy sources have been identified as possible risk factors for renal cell carcinoma. it is possible that a high energy intake as such rather than the individual sources are responsible for the increased risk. furthermore, dairy fats may be associated with renal cell carcinoma risk. the observed associations appeared stronger in women, and did not explain the association with obesity and low socio-economic status previously found in denmark.
in this study we investigated the involvement of estrogen receptors alpha and beta in both sexual behaviour and estradiol-induced enhancement of hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult female rat. our study utilized recently available subtype selective alpha and beta estrogen receptor (er) agonists, propyl-pyrazole triol (ppt) and diarylpropionitrile (dpn) to examine each receptor's contribution, individual and co-operative, for these primarily estradiol-mediated processes. to evaluate sexual behaviour and cell proliferation, rats were bi-laterally ovariectomized (ovx) and received subcutaneous injections of estradiol (10 (ag), ppt and dpn alone (1.25, 2.5, 5.0 mg /0 .1 ml dmso) or in combination (2.5 mg ppt + 2.5 mg dpn/ 0.1 ml dmso). for experiment 1, our findings demonstrate that eralpha is involved in eliciting both proceptive and receptive behaviour. our laboratory has previously found that estradiol increases cell proliferation within 4 hrs in the dentate gyrus of adult female rats, therefore, for experiment 2 we administered estradiol or the agonist(s) 4 hrs prior to the cell synthesis marker bromodeoxyuridine (brdu; 200 mg/kg). dpn enhanced cell proliferation by approximately 40% at all three administered doses (1.25 mg, p<0.008; 2.5 mg, p<0.003; 5 mg, p< 0.005), whereas ppt showed increased cell proliferation (by approximately 50%, p< 0.0002) at a specific dose of 2.5 mg. our results demonstrate both eralpha and erbeta are individually involved in estradiol-enhanced cell proliferation. dual receptor activation resulted in decreased levels of proceptivity, receptivity and cell proliferation, compared to either agonist alone, supporting previous studies suggesting that eralpha and erbeta may modulate each other's activity. our results demonstrate the exclusive involvement of each er subtype in two distinct physiological processes, sexual behaviour and hippocampal cell proliferation and suggest that a component of er regulated cell proliferation may take place through alternative ligand and/or cell-signaling mechanisms. < two hours following intraperitoneal injection, estradiol‐h3 is concentrated by cells in a system of limbic and hypothalamic structures. preoptic‐hypothalamic nuclei containing estrogen‐concentrating cells include the medial preoptic area, medial anterior hypothalamus, ventromedial nucleus, arcuate nucleus and ventral premammillary nucleus. limbic structures include the medial and cortical nuclei of the amygdala, lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, diagonal band of broca, olfactory tubercle, ventral hippocampus, and prepiriform and entorhinal cortex. labelled cells were also found in the lateral and ventrolateral portions of the mesencephalic central grey. compared to these regions, most other regions of the nervous system, including the spinal cord, have very small numbers of labelled cells, which are relatively weakly labelled, and are not found in regular, specific locations. the distribution of estrogen‐concentrating cells determined with the present autoradiographic method agrees with previous autoradiographic conclusions and with biochemical results from cell fractionation experiments.
wheat germ agglutinin (wga) is a paradigm for understanding intracellular transport of lectins. as a protein exploiting the receptor-mediated endocytosis for internalization, wga is also a valuable model system for exploring the endocytic and exocytic pathway. in this study, quantum dot-based single-particle tracking was performed to investigate the transport of wga in live cells, revealing firstly that the endocytic and exocytic processes of wga were both actin- and microtubule-dependent, each including five stages. the vesicle fusion event occurred near the cytomembrane, followed by two destinies with wga: shedding to the extracellular or reversing to the cytoplasm. these findings suggest a distinct and dynamic scenario for the transport of lectins following a receptor-mediated endo/exocytic pathway in live cells. this is important for the application of lectins as drug carriers and antineoplastic drugs in medicine, and also offers insights into the pathway of endocytosis and exocytosis. the delivery of therapeutic agents to, or via, the oral cavity is limited by the efficient removal mechanisms that exist in this area. lectins are proteins or glycoproteins that bind to specific sugar residues, and can, therefore, interact with the glycoconjugates present on cell surfaces or salivary mucins. endogenous lectins could also be used as points of attachment for carbohydrate-containing delivery systems. this review considers the possibility of using lectins as targeting agents within the oral cavity and reports on some of the limited number of studies completed to date. as lectins are multifunctional molecules, the possibility of using them as both targeting and therapeutic agents is considered. lectin-containing delivery systems are a potential innovation for targeted and prolonged therapy within the oral cavity, but considerations such as toxicity and cost will need to be addressed before their routine use becomes a reality.
backgrounda decision tree has been developed for evaluating risks posed by combined exposures to multiple chemicals. the decision tree divides combined exposures of humans and ecological receptors into groups where one or more components are a concern by themselves, where risks from the combined exposures are of low concern, and where there is a concern for the effects from the combined exposures but not from individual chemicals. this paper applies the decision tree to real-world examples of exposures to multiple chemicals, evaluates the usefulness of the approach, and identifies issues arising from the application.resultsthe decision tree was used to evaluate human health and ecological effects from the combined exposure to 559 mixtures of substances measured in surface waters and effluents. the samples contained detectable levels of 2 to 49 substances. the key findings were, 1) the need for assessments of the combined exposures varied for ecological and human health effects and with the source of the monitoring data, 2) the majority of the toxicity came from one chemical in 44% of the exposures (human health) and 60% of exposures (ecological effects), 3) most cases, where risk from combined exposures was a concern, would have been identified using chemical-by-chemical assessments. finally, the tree identified chemicals where data on the mode of action would be most useful in refining an assessment.conclusionsthe decision tree provided useful information on the need for combined risk assessments and guidance on the questions that should be addressed in future research. the threshold of toxicological concern (ttc) is a pragmatic risk assessment tool that is based on the principle of establishing a human exposure threshold value for all chemicals, below which there is a very low probability of an appreciable risk to human health. the concept that there are levels of exposure that do not cause adverse effects is inherent in setting acceptable daily intakes (adis) for chemicals with known toxicological profiles. the ttc principle extends this concept by proposing that a de minimis value can be identified for many chemicals, in the absence of a full toxicity database, based on their chemical structures and the known toxicity of chemicals which share similar structural characteristics. the establishment and application of widely accepted ttc values would benefit consumers, industry and regulators. by avoiding unnecessary toxicity testing and safety evaluations when human intakes are below such a threshold, application of the ttc approach would focus limited resources of time, cost, animal use and expertise on the testing and evaluation of substances with the greatest potential to pose risks to human health and thereby contribute to a reduction in the use of animals. an expert group of the european branch of the international life sciences institute-ilsi europe-has examined the ttc principle for its wider applicability in food safety evaluation. the expert group examined metabolism and accumulation, structural alerts, endocrine disrupting chemicals and specific endpoints, such as neurotoxicity, teratogenicity, developmental toxicity, allergenicity and immunotoxicity, and determined whether such properties or endpoints had to be taken into consideration specifically in a step-wise approach. the expert group concluded that the ttc principle can be applied for low concentrations in food of chemicals that lack toxicity data, provided that there is a sound intake estimate. the use of a decision tree to apply the ttc principle is proposed, and this paper describes the step-wise process in detail. proteins, heavy metals and polyhalogenated-dibenzodioxins and related compounds were excluded from this approach. when assessing a chemical, a review of prior knowledge and context of use should always precede the use of the ttc decision tree. the initial step is the identification and evaluation of possible genotoxic and/or high potency carcinogens. following this step, non-genotoxic substances are evaluated in a sequence of steps related to the concerns that would be associated with increasing intakes. for organophosphates a ttc of 18microg per person per day (0.3 microg/kg bw/day) is proposed, and when the compound is not an op, the ttc values for the cramer structural classes iii, ii and i, with their respective ttc levels (e.g. 1800, 540 and 90 microg per person per day; or 30, 9 and 1.5 microg/kg bw /day), would be applied sequentially. all other endpoints or properties were shown to have a distribution of no observed effect levels (noels) similar to the distribution of noels for general toxicity endpoints in cramer classes i, ii and iii. the document was discussed with a wider audience during a workshop held in march 2003 (see list of workshop participants).
the production of blood cells depends on a rare hematopoietic stem-cell (hsc) population, but the molecular mechanisms underlying hsc biology remain incompletely understood. here, we identify a subset of micrornas (mirnas) that is enriched in hscs compared with other bone-marrow cells. an in vivo gain-of-function screen found that three of these mirnas conferred a competitive advantage to engrafting hematopoietic cells, whereas other hsc mirnas attenuated production of blood cells. overexpression of the most advantageous mirna, mir-125b, caused a dose-dependent myeloproliferative disorder that progressed to a lethal myeloid leukemia in mice and also enhanced hematopoietic engraftment in human immune system mice. our study identifies an evolutionarily conserved subset of mirnas that is expressed in hscs and functions to modulate hematopoietic output. to improve our ability to identify hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) and their localization in vivo, we compared the gene expression profiles of highly purified hscs and non-self-renewing multipotent hematopoietic progenitors (mpps). cell surface receptors of the slam family, including cd150, cd244, and cd48, were differentially expressed among functionally distinct progenitors. hscs were highly purified as cd150(+)cd244(-)cd48(-) cells while mpps were cd244(+)cd150(-)cd48(-) and most restricted progenitors were cd48(+)cd244(+)cd150(-). the primitiveness of hematopoietic progenitors could thus be predicted based on the combination of slam family members they expressed. this is the first family of receptors whose combinatorial expression precisely distinguishes stem and progenitor cells. the ability to purify hscs based on a simple combination of slam receptors allowed us to identify hscs in tissue sections. many hscs were associated with sinusoidal endothelium in spleen and bone marrow, though some hscs were associated with endosteum. hscs thus occupy multiple niches, including sinusoidal endothelium in diverse tissues.
this research study explored the lived experiences of adults diagnosed with coronary artery disease (cad) when exposed to a prolonged period of extreme cold. the potential health impacts of climate change are wide-ranging, from direct impacts at familiar local scales, through indirect effects occurring at the regional or ecosystem level, to long term effects on the sustainability of global systems. to assess these potential impacts, there is a need to broaden the scope of health impact assessment. eco-epidemiology is emerging as a response to this need. eco-epidemiology entails a shift in focus: from direct (toxicological) to indirect (ecological) mechanisms; and from effects occurring at 'human' temporal and geographical scales to those at regional and geophysical scales. we discuss the potential health impacts of climate change on each scale. at the global scale, interactions and feedbacks between systems are critical determinants of long term outcomes. from an eco-epidemiological perspective, the study of climate change becomes inseparable from the study of global change more generally.
the propiconazole (prop) is a fungicide extensively used in agriculture. there are evidences that this compound may cause endocrine disrupting effects. in vitro studies have demonstrated that prop inhibits the activity of cyp 19 (aromatase), responsible for converting androgens into estrogens and also is an androgen and estrogen receptor antagonist. therefore, this study evaluated the reproductive toxicity of prop treatment in male rats. the wistar rats were divided in three groups and were treated daily, by gavage, with corn oil (control group), propiconazole 4 mg/kg (prop 4) and 20 mg/kg (prop 20), from post-natal day 50 to 120. the following were observed: the body weight gain, sexual behavior, testosterone and estradiol plasmatic levels, organs weight, sperm count and morphology and testicular histomorphology. there was an increase in abnormal tail morphology sperm, seminal vesicle and vas deferens weight, and a decrease in estradiol levels in prop 4 group. sexual behavior was affected only in the prop 20 group. these results suggest that prop treatment induced alterations in some reproductive parameters, what could be related with an endocrine disruption. many pesticides are able to block or activate the steroid hormone receptors and/or to affect the levels of sex hormones, thereby potentially affecting the development or expression of the male and female reproductive system or both. this emphasizes the relevance of screening pesticides for a wide range of hormone-mimicking effects. twenty-two pesticides were tested for their ability to affect cyp19 aromatase activity in human placental microsomes using the classical [(3)h](2)o method. prochloraz, imazalil, propioconazole, fenarimol, triadimenol, triadimefon (all fungicides), and dicofol (an acaricide) gave rise to a statistically significant inhibition of aromatase activity. the ic(50)s of prochloraz, imazalil, propioconazole fenarimol, triadimenol, and triadimefon were calculated from dose-response curves to be 0.04, 0.34, 6.5, 10, 21 and 32 microm, respectively. the ic(50) of dicofol was greater than 50 microm. the positive control 4-hydroxyandrostendione (1 microm) caused an inhibition of aromatase activity by 74%. the compounds, which did not affect the aromatase activity, were bromopropylate, chlorfenvinphos, chlorobenzilate, chlorpyrifos, diuron, heptachlor, iprodion, linuron, pentachlorphenol, procymidon, propyzamide, quintozen, tetrachlorvinphos and tetradifon. with the purpose of comparing the results for fenarimol obtained with the microsomal system with data from an intact cell system, an aromatase assay based on jeg-3 cells was established. 4-hydroxyandrostendione (1 microm) inhibited the aromatase activity in jeg-3 cells by 94%. the ic(50) for fenarimol in this system was 2 microm, slightly lower than that observed in the microsomal system. for the first time, fenarimol has been demonstrated to inhibit aromatase activity in human tissues and, furthermore, propioconazole, triadimefon, and triadimenol were identified as weak aromatase inhibitors. in conclusion, seven out of 22 tested pesticides turned out to be weak to moderate aromatase inhibitors in vitro, indicating the relevance of elucidating the endocrine effects in vivo of these- compounds.
abstract the aim of this study was to quantify the prominence levels of elite and highly competitive young soccer players. this study also analyzed the variation in general network properties at different competitive levels and periods of the season. a total of 132 matches, played by 28 teams during the 2015/2016 season, were analyzed. the results revealed significant differences in the composition of general network measures considering the competitive level (p = 0.002; es = 0.077) and according to the location of the match (p = 0.001; es = 0.147). there were positive correlations between network density and the final score (ρ = 0.172) and negative correlations between network density and goals conceded (ρ = - 0.300). significant differences in the composite of centralities were found between positions (p = 0.001; es = 0.293; moderate effect) and the location of the match (p = 0.001; es = 0.013; no effect). this revealed that the general properties of cooperation increased with the competitive level, improved during the middle of the season and were better in home matches. midfielders were most prominent players in elite and u19 teams in the mid-season and central defenders had the most prominent centralities in u17 and u15 during the early and late periods of the season. abstract the aim of this study was to propose a set of network methods to measure the specific properties of a team. these metrics were organised at macro-analysis levels. the interactions between teammates were collected and then processed following the analysis levels herein announced. overall, 577 offensive plays were analysed from five matches. the network density showed an ambiguous relationship among the team, mainly during the 2nd half. the mean values of density for all matches were 0.48 in the 1st half, 0.32 in the 2nd half and 0.34 for the whole match. the heterogeneity coefficient for the overall matches rounded to 0.47 and it was also observed that this increased in all matches in the 2nd half. the centralisation values showed that there was no ‘star topology’. the results suggest that each node (i.e., each player) had nearly the same connectivity, mainly in the 1st half. nevertheless, the values increased in the 2nd half, showing a decreasing participation of all players at the same level. briefly, these metrics showed that it is possible to identify how players connect with each other and the kind and strength of the connections between them. in summary, it may be concluded that network metrics can be a powerful tool to help coaches understand team’s specific properties and support decision-making to improve the sports training process based on match analysis.
rationalegenetic inactivation or pharmacological antagonism of neurokinin 1 (nk1) receptors blocks morphine and alcohol reward in rodents, while nk1 antagonism decreases alcohol craving in humans. the role of the nk1 system for relapse-like behavior has not previously been examined.objectivedivergence between human and rodent nk1 receptors has limited the utility of nk1 antagonists developed for the human receptor species for preclinical studies of addiction-related behaviors in rats. here we used l822429, an nk1 antagonist specifically engineered to bind at high affinity to the rat receptor, to assess the effects of nk1 receptor antagonism on alcohol-seeking behaviors in rats.methodsl822429 (15 and 30 mg/kg) was used to examine effects of nk1 receptor antagonism on operant self-administration of 10% alcohol in 30-min daily sessions, as well as intermittent footshock stress- and cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking after extinction of lever responding.resultsat the doses used, l822429 did not significantly affect alcohol self-administration or cue-induced reinstatement, but potently and dose dependently suppressed stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking, with an essentially complete suppression at the highest dose. the effect of l822429 on stress-induced reinstatement was behaviorally specific. the drug had no effect on conditioned suppression of operant responding following fear conditioning, locomotor activity, or self-administration of a sucrose solution.conclusionsto the degree that the reinstatement model provides a model of drug relapse, the results provide support for nk1 antagonism as a promising mechanism for pharmacotherapy of alcoholism, acting through suppression of stress-induced craving and relapse. recent data indicate that alcohol dependence induces long-term neuroadaptations that recruit a negative emotional state. this leads to excessive alcohol ingestion motivated by relief of negative emotionality. a key mechanism in this transition to negative reinforcement is a recruitment of corticotropin-releasing factor (crf) signaling within the amygdala. long term upregulation of crf(1) receptors is observed in the amygdala following a history of dependence, and crf antagonists selectively block emotionality, excessive alcohol drinking and stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking in post-dependent animals. innate upregulation of crf(1) receptor expression mimics the post-dependent phenotype, both with regard to emotional responses and ethanol self-administration. therefore, the crf system is emerging as a key element of the neuroadaptive changes driving alcoholism and as a major target for its treatment.
hereditary nasal parakeratosis (hnpk), an inherited monogenic autosomal recessive skin disorder, leads to crusts and fissures on the nasal planum of labrador retrievers. we performed a genome-wide association study (gwas) using 13 hnpk cases and 23 controls. we obtained a single strong association signal on chromosome 2 (praw = 4.4×10−14). the analysis of shared haplotypes among the 13 cases defined a critical interval of 1.6 mb with 25 predicted genes. we re-sequenced the genome of one case at 38× coverage and detected 3 non-synonymous variants in the critical interval with respect to the reference genome assembly. we genotyped these variants in larger cohorts of dogs and only one was perfectly associated with the hnpk phenotype in a cohort of more than 500 dogs. this candidate causative variant is a missense variant in the suv39h2 gene encoding a histone 3 lysine 9 (h3k9) methyltransferase, which mediates chromatin silencing. the variant c.972t>g is predicted to change an evolutionary conserved asparagine into a lysine in the catalytically active domain of the enzyme (p.n324k). we further studied the histopathological alterations in the epidermis in vivo. our data suggest that the hnpk phenotype is not caused by hyperproliferation, but rather delayed terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. thus, our data provide evidence that suv39h2 is involved in the epigenetic regulation of keratinocyte differentiation ensuring proper stratification and tight sealing of the mammalian epidermis. to provide a stable environmental barrier, the epidermis requires an integrated network of cytoskeletal elements and cellular junctions. nevertheless, the epidermis ranks among the body's most dynamic tissues, continually regenerating itself and responding to cutaneous insults. as keratinocytes journey from the basal compartment towards the cornified layers, they completely reorganize their adhesive junctions and cytoskeleton. these architectural components are more than just rivets and scaffolds — they are active participants in epidermal morphogenesis that regulate epidermal polarization, signalling and barrier formation.
oral care is a crucial routine for patients with dysphagia that, when completed routinely, can prevent the development of aspiration pneumonia. there is no standardised protocol for oral care within government hospitals in south africa. this study aimed to investigate the outcome of an oral care protocol. participants were patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, with either stroke or traumatic brain injury as the underlying medical pathology, and nurses. all participants were recruited from one tertiary level government hospital in gauteng, south africa. 139 nurses participated in the study and received training on the oral care protocol. there were two groups of participants with oropharyngeal dysphagia. group one (study group, n = 23) was recruited by consecutive sampling, received regular oral care and were not restricted from drinking water; however, all other liquids were restricted. group two (comparison group, n = 23) was recruited via a retrospective record review, received inconsistent oral care and were placed on thickened liquids or liquid restricted diets. results showed that a regimen of regular oral care and free water provision when combined with dysphagia intervention did prevent aspiration pneumonia in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia. the article highlights two key findings: that regular and routine oral care is manageable within an acute government hospital context and a strict routine of oral care can reduce aspiration pneumonia in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia. an implication from these findings is confirmation that teamwork in acute care settings in developing contexts must be prioritised to improve dysphagia management and patient prognosis. swallowing musculature is asymmetrically represented in both motor cortices. stroke affecting the hemisphere with the dominant swallowing projection results in dysphagia and clinical recovery has been correlated with compensatory changes in the previously non-dominant, unaffected hemisphere. this asymmetric bilaterality may explain why up to half of stroke patients are dysphagic and why many will regain a safe swallow over a comparatively short period. despite this propensity for recovery, dysphagia carries a sevenfold increased risk of aspiration pneumonia and is an independent predictor of mortality. the identification, clinical course, pathophysiology, and treatment of dysphagia after stroke are discussed in this review.
reactive oxygen species (ros) are toxic by-products generated continuously during seed desiccation, storage, and germination, resulting in seed deterioration and therefore decreased seed longevity. the toxicity of ros is due to their indiscriminate reactivity with almost any constituent of the cell, such as lipids, proteins, and dna. the damage to the genome induced by ros has been recognized as an important cause of seed deterioration. a prominent dna lesion induced by ros is 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-g), which can form base pairs with adenine instead of cytosine during dna replication and leads to gc→ta transversions. in arabidopsis, atogg1 is a dna glycosylase/apurinic/apyrimidinic (ap) lyase that is involved in base excision repair for eliminating 8-oxo-g from dna. in this study, the functions of atogg1 were elaborated. the transcript of atogg1 was detected in seeds, and it was strongly up-regulated during seed desiccation and imbibition. analysis of transformed arabidopsis protoplasts demonstrated that atogg1-yellow fluorescent protein fusion protein localized to the nucleus. overexpression of atogg1 in arabidopsis enhanced seed resistance to controlled deterioration treatment. in addition, the content of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dg) in transgenic seeds was reduced compared to wild-type seeds, indicating a dna damage-repair function of atogg1 in vivo. furthermore, transgenic seeds exhibited increased germination ability under abiotic stresses such as methyl viologen, nacl, mannitol, and high temperatures. taken together, our results demonstrated that overexpression of atogg1 in arabidopsis enhances seed longevity and abiotic stress tolerance. repair of the ubiquitous mutagenic lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxog) is initiated in eukaryotes by dna glycosylases/lyases, such as yeast ogg1, that do not share significant sequence identity with their prokaryotic counterparts, typified by escherichia coli mutm (fpg) protein. the unexpected presence of a functional mutm orthologue in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana has brought into question the existence of functional ogg1 orthologues in plants. we report here the cdna cloning, expression and functional characterization of atogg1, an arabidopsisthaliana gene widely expressed in different plant tissues which encodes a 40.3 kda protein with significant sequence identity to yeast and human ogg1 proteins. purified atogg1 enzyme specifically cleaves duplex dna containing an 8-oxog:c mispair, and the repair reaction proceeds through an imine intermediate characteristic of all bifunctional dna glycosylases/lyases. consistent with its in vitro activity, expression of atogg1 suppresses the mutator phenotype of an e. coli strain deficient in 8-oxog repair. our results suggest that atogg1 is an structural and functional homologue of ogg1 and establish the presence of two distinct 8-oxog repair enzymes in arabidopsis.
background data from a long-established hospital-based cancer registry were used to analyse the relationship between clinical and organisational factors and disease-specific survival among women with primary breast cancer.   methods 2023 women with incident invasive breast cancer diagnosed from 1992 to 2005 were identified through the hospital del mar cancer registry (barcelona, spain). patients were followed until december 2008. one-, 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were estimated. kaplan-meier and cox regression models were used to analyse death from breast cancer.   results at diagnosis 70.2% of tumours were in stages i-ii. during follow-up 705 deaths occurred, 58.4% specifically due to breast cancer. five- and 10-year breast cancer specific survival rates were 83.3% and 73.7%, respectively (stage i, 97.1% and 94.0%; stage ii, 88.0% and 79.4%; stage iii, 70.1% and 46.3%, and stage iv, 24.5% and 6.1%, respectively). the 5-year disease-specific survival rate increased from 73.5% in 1992-1995 to 86.4% in 2001-2005 (log rank, p<0.001). multivariate analyses showed that prognosis was less favourable for women diagnosed between 1992 and 1995, for those whose route to diagnosis was not the screening programme, women aged ≥ 70 years, with stage iv tumours, with high grade lesions, and for women who received only palliative or symptomatic treatment. adjusting for prognostic factors, surgeon's experience did not significantly appeared to affect survival of operated women.   conclusions in this centre survival from breast cancer improved markedly from 1992 to 2005. breast cancer prognosis was influenced by both clinical and organisational variables. the quantification of the role of such factors affords valuable knowledge to improve cancer care in settings similar to the study hospital. chemotherapy and hormone therapy prolong disease-free and overall survival for patients with breast cancer in the clinical-trial setting, but it is not clear if this translates into a benefit on a population basis. it is also not clear if surgical caseload has any influence on survival. we used cancer-registry data from 12,861 patients with breast cancer treated in yorkshire, uk, between 1979 and 1988, and found that patients of surgeons with higher rates of usage of chemotherapy and hormone therapy (regional mean usage 9.3%, range 0-46%) had prolonged survival. there was considerable variation in survival of breast cancer patients between surgeons, but their rate of use of chemotherapy and hormone therapy explained about 26% of this survival variation. had the practice of the surgeons with the better outcomes been used by all treating clinicians, 5-year survival would have increased by about 4-5%. examination of differences in survival as a function of consultant caseload demonstrated poorer results amongst those surgeons treating less than 30 new cases of breast cancer per year (risk ratio [95% ci] for treating > 30 compared with < 10 = 0.85 [0.77-0.93]). we recommend that patients with breast cancer be dealt with only by clinicians who see more than 30 new cases per year and who have a full range of treatment options available within a multidisciplinary setting.
tese de doutoramento em psicologia, na especialidade de neuropsicologia, apresentada a faculdade de psicologia e de ciencias da educacao da universidade de coimbra the free and cued selective reminding test (fcsrt) is a verbal episodic memory test used to identify patients with mild alzheimer's disease (ad). the present study investigates the relationships between performance on fcsrt and grey matter atrophy assessed with structural mri in patients with ad. three complementary mri-based analyses (vbm analysis, roi-based analysis, and three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis) were performed in 35 patients with ad to analyze correlations between regional atrophy and their scores for episodic memory using the fcsrt. with vbm analysis, the total score on the fcsrt was correlated with left medial temporal lobe atrophy including the left hippocampus but also the thalami. in addition, using roi-based analysis, the total recall score on the fcsrt was correlated with the left hippocampal volume. with three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis, both free recall and total recall scores were correlated with regions corresponding approximately to the ca1 field. no correlation was found with short term memory scores using any of these methods of analysis. in ad, the fcsrt may be considered as a useful clinical marker of memory disorders due to medial temporal damage, specially the ca1 field of the hippocampus.
adynamic bone is the most frequent type of bone lesion in patients with chronic kidney disease; long‐term use of antiresorptive therapy may also lead to the adynamic bone condition. the hallmark of adynamic bone is a loss of bone turnover, and a major clinical concern of adynamic bone is diminished bone quality and an increase in fracture risk. our current study aims to investigate how bone quality changes with age in our previously established mouse model of adynamic bone. young and old mice (4 months old and 16 months old, respectively) were used in this study. col2.3δtk (dtk) mice were treated with ganciclovir and pamidronate to create the adynamic bone condition. bone quality was evaluated using established techniques including bone histomorphometry, microcomputed tomography, quantitative backscattered electron imaging, and biomechanical testing. changes in mineral and matrix properties were examined by powder x‐ray diffraction and raman spectroscopy. aging controls had a natural decline in bone formation and resorption with a corresponding deterioration in trabecular bone structure. bone turnover was severely blunted at all ages in adynamic animals, which preserved trabecular bone loss normally associated with aging. however, the preservation of trabecular bone mass and structure in old adynamic mice did not rescue deterioration of bone mechanical properties. there was also a decrease in cortical bone toughness in old adynamic mice that was accompanied by a more mature collagen matrix and longer bone crystals. little is known about the effects of metabolic bone disease on bone fracture resistance. we observed an age‐related decrease in bone toughness that was worsened by the adynamic condition, and this decrease may be due to material level changes at the tissue level. our mouse model may be useful in the investigation of the mechanisms involved in fractures occurring in elderly patients on antiresorptive therapy who have very low bone turnover. © 2015 american society for bone and mineral research. backgroundbone mass, geometry, and tissue material properties contribute to bone structural integrity. thus, bone strength arises from both bone quantity and quality. bone quality encompasses the geometric and material factors that contribute to fracture resistance.questions/purposesthis review presents an overview of the methods for assessing bone quality across multiple length scales, their outcomes, and their relative advantages and disadvantages.methodsa pubmed search was conducted to identify methods related to bone mechanical testing, imaging, and compositional analysis. using various exclusion criteria, articles were selected for inclusion.resultsmethods for assessing mechanical properties include whole-bone, bulk tissue, microbeam, and micro- and nanoindentation testing techniques. outcomes include structural strength and material modulus. advantages include direct assessment of bone strength; disadvantages include specimen destruction during testing. methods for characterizing bone geometry and microarchitecture include quantitative ct, high-resolution peripheral quantitative ct, high-resolution mri, and micro-ct. outcomes include three-dimensional whole-bone geometry, trabecular morphology, and tissue mineral density. the primary advantage is the ability to image noninvasively; disadvantages include the lack of a direct measure of bone strength. methods for measuring tissue composition include scanning electron microscopy, vibrational spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, and chemical and physical analytical techniques. outcomes include mineral density and crystallinity, elemental composition, and collagen crosslink composition. advantages include the detailed material characterization; disadvantages include the need for a biopsy.conclusionsalthough no single method can completely characterize bone quality, current noninvasive imaging techniques can be combined with ex vivo mechanical and compositional techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of bone quality.
uterine fibroids are an important problem for women of reproductive age. although hysterectomy has been the traditional treatment for fibroids, many women are interested in a less invasive therapy. magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (mrgfus) is a new technique for treating a variety of solid tumors. it has been tested and approved by the u.s. food & drug administration (fda) for the treatment of uterine fibroids. the procedure is completely noninvasive. it is performed as an outpatient procedure and the patient can resume her normal activities the day following the procedure. techniques of treatment of uterine fibroids are still being refined, but significant progress has been made in understanding some of the challenges for this new technology. some fibroids are more responsive to the focused ultrasound; some fibroids are more resistant. not all women are candidates for this procedure. absolute contraindications include bowel that is in the path of the ultrasound beam, or surgical scars in the beam pathway. the procedure of mrgfus is feasible, safe and becoming increasingly popular. questions still remain particularly the use of this technique for patients desiring fertility, and what will be the long-term results. one of the most recent additions to the methods for image-guided therapy is magnetic resonance (mr)-guided focused ultrasound. this method represents a unique closed-loop therapy, with planning, guidance, control, and direct feedback (called mr thermometry), which work together to ensure an effective therapy. the focused ultrasound induces focal tissue destruction by thermocoagulation in a noninvasive manner. mr also enables real-time thermometry to be performed during each and every sonication. these characteristics make mr-guided focused ultrasound an exciting new approach for treating fibroids. fibroids are diagnosed based on findings from the patient's physical examination supplemented by imaging results. mr imaging is preferred to other imaging modalities because it enables the fibroids and the entire pelvis to be fully examined. after individual fibroids are identified and the target area is defined by the radiologist, the target volume is analyzed in a three-dimensional assessment to ensure the patient's safety. the procedure begins with the delivery of low-power sonication, and the power is gradually increased until the therapeutic dose is reached. after the procedure, postcontrast images are acquired; these should demonstrate tissue necrosis. the results of clinical trials have shown that the treatment is safe, effective, and highly acceptable to patients.
the signaling molecule rgs9-2 is a potent modulator of g-protein-coupled receptor function in striatum. our earlier work revealed a critical role for rgs9-2 in the actions of the μ-opioid receptor (mor) agonist morphine. in this study, we demonstrate that rgs9-2 may act as a positive or negative modulator of mor-mediated behavioral responses in mice depending on the agonist administered. paralleling these findings we use coimmunoprecipitation assays to show that the signaling complexes formed between rgs9-2 and gα subunits in striatum are determined by the mor agonist, and we identify rgs9-2 containing complexes associated with analgesic tolerance. in striatum, mor activation promotes the formation of complexes between rgs9-2 and several gα subunits, but morphine uniquely promotes an association between rgs9-2 and gαi3. in contrast, rgs9-2/gαq complexes assemble after acute application of several mor agonists but not after morphine application. repeated morphine administration leads to the formation of distinct complexes, which contain rgs9-2, gβ5, and gαq. finally, we use simple pharmacological manipulations to disrupt rgs9-2 complexes formed during repeated mor activation to delay the development of analgesic tolerance to morphine. our data provide a better understanding of the brain-region-specific signaling events associated with opiate analgesia and tolerance and point to pharmacological approaches that can be readily tested for improving chronic analgesic responsiveness. a subfamily of regulators of g protein signaling (rgs) proteins consisting of rgs6, -7, -9, and -11 is characterized by the presence of a unique ggamma-like domain through which they form obligatory dimers with the g protein subunit gbeta5 in vivo. in caenorhabditis elegans, orthologs of gbeta5.rgs dimers are implicated in regulating both galphai and galphaq signaling, and in cell-based assays these dimers regulate galphai/o- and galphaq/11-mediated pathways. however, initial studies with purified gbeta5.rgs6 or gbeta5.rgs7 showed that they only serve as gtpase activating proteins for galphao. pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation with these dimers failed to detect their binding to either galphao or galphaq, indicating that the interaction might require additional factors present in vivo. here, we asked if the rgs7.gbeta5 complex binds to galphaq using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret) in transiently transfected mammalian cells. rgs7, gbeta5, and galpha subunits were tagged with yellow variants of green fluorescent protein. first we confirmed the functional activity of the fusion proteins by co-immunoprecipitation and also their effect on signaling. second, we again demonstrate the interaction between rgs7 and gbeta5 using fret. finally, using both fret spectroscopy on cell suspensions and microscopy of individual cells, we showed fret between the yellow fluorescence protein-tagged rgs7.gbeta5 complex and cyan fluorescence protein-tagged galphaq, indicating a direct interaction between these molecules.
hamp domains mediate input–output communication in many bacterial signalling proteins. to explore the dynamic bundle model of hamp signalling (zhou et al., mol. microbiol. 73: 801, 2009), we characterized the signal outputs of 118 hamp missense mutants of the serine chemoreceptor, tsr, by flagellar rotation patterns. receptors with proline or charged amino acid replacements at critical hydrophobic packing residues in the as1 and as2 hamp helices had locked kinase‐off outputs, indicating that drastic destabilization of the tsr‐hamp bundle prevents kinase activation, both in the absence and presence of the sensory adaptation enzymes, cheb and cher. attractant‐mimic lesions that enhance the structural stability of the hamp bundle also suppressed kinase activity, demonstrating that tsr‐hamp has two kinase‐off output states at opposite extremes of its stability range. hamp mutants with locked‐on kinase outputs appeared to have intermediate bundle stabilities, implying a biphasic relationship between hamp stability and kinase activity. some tsr‐hamp mutant receptors exhibited reversed output responses to cheb and cher action that are readily explained by a biphasic control logic. the findings of this study provide strong support for a three‐state dynamic bundle model of hamp signalling in tsr, and possibly in other bacterial transducers as well. regulation of the direction of flagellar rotation is central to the mechanism of bacterial chemotaxis. the transitions between counterclockwise and clockwise rotation are controlled by a "switch complex" composed of three proteins (flig, flim, and flin) and located at the base of the flagellar motor. the mechanism of function of the switch is unknown. here we demonstrate that the diffusible clockwise-signal molecule, the chey protein, binds to the switch, that the primary docking site is flim, that the extent of chey binding to flim is dependent upon the phosphorylation level of chey, and that it is unaffected by the other two switch proteins. this study provides a biochemical demonstration of binding of a signal molecule to the bacterial switch and demonstrates directly that phosphorylation regulates the activity of this molecule.
the operation of partitioning an image into a collection of connected sets of pixels is known as image segmentation. expectation maximization (em) segmentation requires appropriate initialization of tissue class mean and variance, as it is get stuck on particular possible area of intensity of the probability nature. decisive initialization is a necessary exploratory process for the forthcoming convergence of the algorithm to best regional maximum of possibility task. indiscriminate initialization is not dossier directed, deep from optimal, outcomes are not reproducible, do not take advantage of deep rooted patterns in the data or may be loaded on outliers. this paper evaluates the performance of em segmentation with random initialization, histogram guided initialization and initialization with k-means with respect to computational complexity and root mean squared error of tissue class mean and variance, updated by em, with manually estimated tissue class mean and variance as ground truth, on paramount plane, t1 contrast and magnetic resonance (mr) images of glioblastoma multiframe (gbm) edema complex. the random initialization and histogram guided initialization was experimented for k-means, from the clustered output of which; initial tissue class mean and variance for em are derived. rms error remains the same for em initialized and histogram guided k-means. em initialized with k-means which has histogram guided initialization converges fast than the random initialization k-means, but the computational time is more for the former initialization than the latter. the experimental evaluation of em initialization schemes and fuzzy cluster means (fcm) were performed in matlab. the efficacy of fuzzy cluster means clustering was analyzed qualitatively on tumour-edema complex. fcm could identify only 3 classes including background in the mr specimens. fcm consider edema and certain parts of wm as a single tissue class. similarly, fcm clubs gm, csf and necrotic focus into tissue class and produced empty clusters. an integration of a minimal spanning tree (mst) based graph-theoretic technique and expectation maximization (em) algorithm with rough set initialization is described for non-convex clustering. em provides the statistical model of the data and handles the associated uncertainties. rough set theory helps in faster convergence and avoidance of the local minima problem, thereby enhancing the performance of em. mst helps in determining non-convex clusters. since it is applied on gaussians rather than the original data points, time required is very low. these features are demonstrated on real life datasets. comparison with related methods is made in terms of a cluster quality measure and computation time.
promoters process signals through recruitment of transcription factors and rna polymerase, and dynamic changes in promoter activity constitute a major noise source in gene expression. however, it is barely understood how complex promoter architectures determine key features of promoter dynamics. here, we employ prototypical promoters of yeast ribosomal protein genes as well as simplified versions thereof to analyze the relations among promoter design, complexity, and function. these promoters combine the action of a general regulatory factor with that of specific transcription factors, a common motif of many eukaryotic promoters. by comprehensively analyzing stationary and dynamic promoter properties, this model-based approach enables us to pinpoint the structural characteristics underlying the observed behavior. functional tradeoffs impose constraints on the promoter architecture of ribosomal protein genes. we find that a stable scaffold in the natural design results in low transcriptional noise and strong co-regulation of target genes in the presence of gene silencing. this configuration also exhibits superior shut-off properties, and it can serve as a tunable switch in living cells. model validation with independent experimental data suggests that the models are sufficiently realistic. when combined, our results offer a mechanistic explanation for why specific factors are associated with low protein noise in vivo. many of these findings hold for a broad range of model parameters and likely apply to other eukaryotic promoters of similar structure. information-carrying signals in the real world are often obscured by noise. a challenge for any system is to filter the signal from the corrupting noise. this task is particularly acute for the signal transduction network that mediates bacterial chemotaxis, because the signals are subtle, the noise arising from stochastic fluctuations is substantial, and the system is effectively acting as a differentiator which amplifies noise. here, we investigated the filtering properties of this biological system. through simulation, we first show that the cutoff frequency has a dramatic effect on the chemotactic efficiency of the cell. then, using a mathematical model to describe the signal, noise, and system, we formulated and solved an optimal filtering problem to determine the cutoff frequency that bests separates the low-frequency signal from the high-frequency noise. there was good agreement between the theory, simulations, and published experimental data. finally, we propose that an elegant implementation of the optimal filter in combination with a differentiator can be achieved via an integral control system. this paper furnishes a simple quantitative framework for interpreting many of the key notions about bacterial chemotaxis, and, more generally, it highlights the constraints on biological systems imposed by noise.
abstract although acyclovir prophylaxis against varicella zoster virus (vzv) infection for ≥1 year is recommended after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (hct), the emergence of acyclovir-resistant viruses and adverse drug effects cannot be ignored. we investigated the cumulative incidence of vzv infection after allogeneic hct in children receiving a shorter duration of acyclovir prophylaxis than recommended and evaluated the appropriateness of the short duration of acyclovir prophylaxis. medical records of 217 children who received allogeneic hct were retrospectively reviewed until a median of 25 months (range = 1–59 months) after hct. acyclovir prophylaxis was given for a median of 9 weeks (range = 3–24 weeks) after hct. vzv infection was diagnosed in 33 (15.2%) children at a median time of 5 months (range = 2–41 months) after hct. the 1-year and 2-year cumulative incidences of vzv infection after allogeneic hct were 11.2% and 15.5%, respectively. these incidences were between the previously reported 1-year incidence of 25% to 30% in patients not receiving prophylaxis and 1-year incidence of 4% to 5% in patients receiving ≥1 year duration of prophylaxis. male sex and older age were significantly associated with vzv infection after allogeneic hct. only 1 chickenpox patient experienced severe complications because of vzv infection, and there were no deaths attributable to vzv infection. in conclusion, a shorter duration of acyclovir prophylaxis may be appropriate for children receiving allogeneic hct, based on the rare occurrence of severe complications because of vzv infection and the expected discomfort because of daily oral medication for a long time. to evaluate the efficacy of long‐term prophylaxis with ultra‐low‐dose acyclovir against varicella‐zoster virus (vzv) reactivation, we analyzed the records of 242 japanese adult patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the first time from 1995 to 2006 at our hospital. we started long‐term oral acyclovir at 200 mg/day in july 2001. acyclovir was continued until the end of immunosuppressive therapy and at least 1 year after transplantation. sixty‐six patients developed vzv reactivation at a median of 248 days after hsct, with a cumulative incidence of 34.7%. only one breakthrough reactivation occurred during long‐term acyclovir, which responded well to therapeutic dose of valacyclovir. the use of long‐term acyclovir was the only independent determinant that significantly decreased the overall incidence of vzv reactivation (20% vs. 50%, p < 0.0001). with this prophylaxis, visceral dissemination and serious complications other than post‐herpetic neuralgia was completely eliminated, and thereby need for hospitalization was significantly reduced (21% vs. 71%, p = 0.0034). fifteen of the 57 patients who discontinued acyclovir developed vzv reactivation, with a cumulative incidence of 32.1%. vzv reactivation following discontinuation tended to occur in patients who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy at the cessation of acyclovir. these findings suggested that long‐term prophylaxis of ultra‐low‐dose acyclovir resulted in a successful prevention of severe vzv‐related symptoms and death, with a significantly decreased overall incidence of vzv reactivation. prolongation of prophylactic acyclovir on profound immunosuppression might be important for thorough suppression of vzv reactivation. am. j. hematol., 2008. © 2008 wiley‐liss, inc.
abstract nipah virus (niv) is a highly pathogenic, negative-strand rna paramyxovirus that has recently emerged from flying foxes to cause serious human disease. we have analyzed the role of the nonstructural niv c protein in viral immunopathogenesis using recombinant virus lacking the expression of niv c (nivδc). while wild-type niv was highly pathogenic in the hamster animal model, nivδc was strongly attenuated. replication of nivδc was followed by the production of niv-specific antibodies and associated with higher recruitment of inflammatory cells and less intensive histopathological lesions in different organs than in wild-type-niv-infected animals. to analyze the molecular basis of nivδc attenuation, we studied early changes in gene expression in infected primary human endothelial cells, a major cellular target of niv infection. the transcriptomic approach revealed the striking difference between wild-type and mutant niv in the expression of genes involved in immunity, with the particularly interesting differential patterns of proinflammatory cytokines. compared to wild-type virus, nivδc induced increased expression of interleukin 1 beta (il-1β), il-8, cxcl2, cxcl3, cxcl6, ccl20, and beta interferon. furthermore, the expression of niv c in stably transfected cells decreased the production of the same panel of cytokines, revealing a role of the c protein in the regulation of cytokine balance. together, these results suggest that niv c regulates expression of proinflammatory cytokines, therefore providing a signal responsible for the coordination of leukocyte recruitment and the chemokine-induced immune response and controlling the lethal outcome of the infection. abstract we have generated a recombinant newcastle disease virus (ndv) that expresses the green fluorescence protein (gfp) in infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (cefs). this virus is interferon (ifn) sensitive, and pretreatment of cells with chicken alpha/beta ifn (ifn-α/β) completely blocks viral gfp expression. prior transfection of plasmid dna induces an ifn response in cefs and blocks ndv-gfp replication. however, transfection of known inhibitors of the ifn-α/β system, including the influenza a virus ns1 protein and the ebola virus vp35 protein, restores ndv-gfp replication. we therefore conclude that the ndv-gfp virus could be used to screen proteins expressed from plasmids for the ability to counteract the host cell ifn response. using this system, we show that expression of the ndv v protein or the nipah virus v, w, or c proteins rescues ndv-gfp replication in the face of the transfection-induced ifn response. the v and w proteins of nipah virus, a highly lethal pathogen in humans, also block activation of an ifn-inducible promoter in primate cells. interestingly, the amino-terminal region of the nipah virus v protein, which is identical to the amino terminus of nipah virus w, is sufficient to exert the ifn-antagonist activity. in contrast, the anti-ifn activity of the ndv v protein appears to be located in the carboxy-terminal region of the protein, a region implicated in the ifn-antagonist activity exhibited by the v proteins of mumps virus and human parainfluenza virus type 2.
the role of nitric oxide (no) mechanisms incontrol of pyloric function and transpyloric flow wereinvestigated in six conscious dogs. antropyloroduodenalmotility, transpyloric flow, and gastric emptying were measured 15 min after intravenousinjection of 100 ml of either saline, l-arginine (50mg/kg), l-nna (5 mg/kg), or l-arginine (50 mg/kg)followed by l-nna (5 mg/kg). infusion of l-nna wasassociated with retardation of gastric emptying (65± 6%) in the first 30 min, in comparison to thesaline (90 ± 3%) or l-arginine (90 ± 2%).this effect was prevented by infusion of l-arginineprior to l-nna, after which 89 ± 3% of the liquidemptied in 30 min. there was a significant reduction (p< 0.05) in the number and volume of flow pulses, andan increase in pyloric tone (p < 0.05) after l-nna in comparison to the other three testconditions. there were no differences, however, in thenumber of antropyloric or isolated pyloric pressurewaves under the four conditions. our findings suggestthat no mechanisms influence gastric emptying andtranspyloric flow of nonnutrient liquids by altering thepyloric tone, thus increasing resistance toflow. antropyloroduodenal motility was recorded in seven anesthetized dogs to assess the role of nitric oxide and l-arginine metabolites in nonadrenergic noncholinergic (nanc) mediation of pyloric relaxation. pyloric activity induced by duodenal field stimulation was inhibited by antral field stimulation and electrical vagal stimulation. intra-arterial ng-l-arginine-methyl-ester (l-name) reduced the inhibition from antral or vagal stimulation (p less than 0.05). intravenous infusion of l-name also blocked the inhibitory effect of vagal and antral stimulation but left the tetrodotoxin-insensitive action of intra-arterial vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip) and sodium nitroprusside unchanged. l-arginine reversed the effect of l-name whereas d-arginine did not. l-name enhanced pyloric contractions to intra-arterial acetylcholine. the nanc inhibition of the substance p-stimulated pyloric response in vitro was blocked by l-name and reversed by addition of l-arginine. sodium nitroprusside was effective as a relaxant in vitro but vip was not. these data suggest that metabolites of l-arginine mediate neural inhibition of canine pyloric motor activity.
pollination services are inherently shaped by floral resource availability, through the mediation of pollinator population dynamics and the influence on energetically costly processes, such as foraging. here, we review recent insights that have improved our mechanistic understanding of how floral resources shape bee populations and pollination services. our scope includes advances in our understanding of how individual bees and their populations are shaped by nutrient availability; investigations into how contemporary floral resource landscapes influence foraging; and new insights into how these relationships are indirectly impacted by biotic and abiotic factors across communities and landscapes. throughout our review, we take a mechanistic, multi-scalar approach that highlights the complexity of interactions between floral resources and bees, across space and time. global trends in pollinator-dependent crops have raised awareness of the need to support managed and wild bee populations to ensure sustainable crop production. provision of sufficient forage resources is a key element for promoting bee populations within human impacted landscapes, particularly those in agricultural lands where demand for pollination service is high and land use and management practices have reduced available flowering resources. recent government incentives in north america and europe support the planting of wildflowers to benefit pollinators; surprisingly, in north america there has been almost no rigorous testing of the performance of wildflower mixes, or their ability to support wild bee abundance and diversity. we tested different wildflower mixes in a spatially replicated, multiyear study in three regions of north america where production of pollinator-dependent crops is high: florida, michigan, and california. in each region, we quantified flowering among wildflower mixes composed of annual and perennial species, and with high and low relative diversity. we measured the abundance and species richness of wild bees, honey bees, and syrphid flies at each mix over two seasons. in each region, some but not all wildflower mixes provided significantly greater floral display area than unmanaged weedy control plots. mixes also attracted greater abundance and richness of wild bees, although the identity of best mixes varied among regions. by partitioning floral display size from mix identity we show the importance of display size for attracting abundant and diverse wild bees. season-long monitoring also revealed that designing mixes to provide continuous bloom throughout the growing season is critical to supporting the greatest pollinator species richness. contrary to expectation, perennials bloomed in their first season, and complementarity in attraction of pollinators among annuals and perennials suggests that inclusion of functionally diverse species may provide the greatest benefit. wildflower mixes may be particularly important for providing resources for some taxa, such as bumble bees, which are known to be in decline in several regions of north america. no mix consistently attained the full diversity that was planted. further study is needed on how to achieve the desired floral display and diversity from seed mixes.
neural development relies on stringent regulation of key genes that mediate specialized function. trka is primarily expressed in neural crest-derived sensory and sympathetic neurons where it transmits critical survival information. we have identified a 457 base pair sequence upstream of the murine first trka coding exon that is conserved in human and in chick, and is sufficient for expression in the correct cells with appropriate timing. mutation analysis of consensus transcription factor binding domains within the minimal enhancer reveals a complex positive regulation that includes sites required for global expression and sites that are specifically required for drg, trigeminal or sympathetic expression. these results provide a foundation for identification of the transcriptional machinery that specifies neurotrophin receptor expression. multipotential stem cells throughout the developing central nervous system have common properties. among these is expression of the intermediate filament protein nestin and the brain fatty acid binding protein (b-fabp). to determine if common mechanisms control transcription in cns stem cells, the regulatory elements of these two genes were mapped in transgenic mice. a 257 basepair enhancer of the rat nestin gene is sufficient for expression throughout the embryonic neuroepithelium. this enhancer contains two sites bound by the class iii pou proteins brn-1, brn-2, brn-4, and tst-1. only one of the two pou sites is required for cns expression. an adjacent hormone response element is necessary for expression in the dorsal midbrain and forebrain. the regulatory sites of the b-fabp gene are strikingly similar to those of the nestin gene. a hybrid pou/pbx binding site is recognized in vitro by pbx-1, brn-1 and brn-2. this site is essential for expression in most of the cns. in addition, a hormone response element is necessary for forebrain expression. both the nestin and b-fabp genes therefore depend on pou binding sites for general cns expression, with hormone response elements additionally required for activity in the anterior cns. these data indicate that regulation by pou proteins and hormone receptors is a general mechanism for cns stem cell-specific transcription.
functional adaptation of the femur has been studied extensively by embedding remodelling algorithms in finite element models, with bone commonly assumed to have isotropic material properties for computational efficiency. however, isotropy is insufficient in predicting the directionality of bone's observed microstructure. a novel iterative orthotropic 3d adaptation algorithm is proposed and applied to a finite element model of the whole femur. bone was modelled as an optimised strain-driven adaptive continuum with local orthotropic symmetry. each element's material orientations were aligned with the local principal stress directions and their corresponding directional young's moduli updated proportionally to the associated strain stimuli. the converged predicted density distributions for a coronal section of the whole femur were qualitatively and quantitatively compared with the results obtained by the commonly used isotropic approach to bone adaptation and with ex vivo imaging data. the orthotropic assumption was shown to improve the prediction of bone density distribution when compared with the more commonly used isotropic approach, whilst producing lower comparative mass, structurally optimised models. it was also shown that the orthotropic approach can provide additional directional information on the material properties distributions for the whole femur, an advantage over isotropic bone adaptation. orthotropic bone models can help in improving research areas in biomechanics where local structure and mechanical properties are of key importance, such as fracture prediction and implant assessment. © 2014 the authors. international journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering published by john wiley & sons, ltd. in a companion paper, we presented a time‐dependent theory for bone modeling and remodeling in response to a daily loading history. this paper represents a preliminary attempt to use the theory to determine the distribution of bone density within the adult proximal femur under an assumed normal loading history. subsequent functional adaptation of the internal structure due to changes in the loading history are then determined. throughout this preliminary study, the external geometry of the proximal femur is considered to be fixed, i.e., changes in the external shape are neither stimulated nor allowed. linear and trilinear (dead‐zone nonlinearity) rate remodeling laws were compared. computer emulations using two‐dimensional finite element models were successful in creating a normal‐appearing distribution of bone tissue when remodeling was initiated from a solid structure of homogeneous bone density. subsequent reduction in the loading history caused regional bone atrophy. reinstatement of the normal loading history caused a generalized increase in bone mass but resulted in a slightly different bone distribution than was calculated for a constant loading history. these results demonstrate the utility of the remodeling theory and are consistent with the hypothesis that similar stress‐related phenomena are responsible for both normal morphogenesis and functional adaptiation in response to changes in the bone loading.
in most extensions of the standard model, heavy charged higgs bosons at the lhc are dominantly produced in association with heavy quarks. an up-to-date determination of the next-to-leading order total cross section in a type-ii two-higgs-doublet model is presented, including a thorough estimate of the theoretical uncertainties due to missing higher-order corrections, parton distribution functions and physical input parameters. predictions in the four- and five-flavour schemes are compared and reconciled through a recently proposed scale-setting prescription. a four- and five-flavour scheme matched prediction is provided for the interpretation of current and future experimental searches for heavy charged higgs bosons at the lhc. a bstractwe study the production of a higgs boson in association with bottom quarks in hadronic collisions, and present phenomenological predictions relevant to the 13 tev lhc. our results are accurate to the next-to-leading order in qcd, and matched to parton showers through the mc@nlo method; thus, they are fully differential and based on unweighted events, which we shower by using both herwig++ and pythia8. we perform the computation in both the four-flavour and the five-flavour schemes, whose results we compare extensively at the level of exclusive observables. in the case of the higgs transverse momentum, we also consider the analytically-resummed cross section up to the nnlo+nnll accuracy. in addition, we analyse at oαs3$$ \mathcal{o}\left({\alpha}_s^3\right) $$ the effects of the interference between the bb¯h$$ b\overline{b}h $$ and gluon-fusion production modes.
cd81, the scavenger receptor‐bi (sr‐bi) and the low‐density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) are involved in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) hepatitis c virus (hcv) entry. to investigate if these molecules are altered by hcv, 20 controls and 66 patients: 37 untreated and 29 sustained virological responders, were studied. cd81 and ldlr expression, measured the percentage of cells expressing the hcv‐receptors and their mean fluorescence intensity (mfi), was analyzed on lymphocytes and monocytes, as well as sr‐bi on monocytes by flow cytometry. rna was extracted from pbmcs and detection of the hcv‐rna positive and negative strands was performed by strand‐specific rt‐pcr. a statistically significant increase of cd81 expression was observed on lymphocytes, a higher percentage of ldlr on lymphocytes and monocytes, as well as sr‐bi on monocytes was found in the patients as compared to the controls (p < 0.05 in all cases). untreated patients showed a higher percentage of ldlr+ lymphocytes than sustained virological responders (p = 0.025). nineteen sustained virological responders bore the hcv‐rna positive strand in pbmcs; nine of them the negative strand too. sustained virological responders with occult infection and viral replication, showed a higher expression of ldlr on lymphocytes (p < 0.05) and a higher ldlr mfi on monocytes (p = 0.011) than those without viral replication. in conclusion, hcv exposure modifies expression levels of the receptors studied, being ldlr related with hcv replication, not only in the classic but also in the occult infection. j. med. virol. 84:1727–1736, 2012. © 2012 wiley periodicals, inc. hepatitis c virus (hcv) particles in serum associate with lipoproteins (lps), and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) has been implicated in virus attachment and entry into cells. to clarify the basis of interactions between virus and lps, we determined whether hcv interacts with human lps via its envelope glycoprotein e2. the binding of serum-derived virus-like particles, hcv e2, and hcv e2-lp complexes to cd81 and ldlr was studied. incubation of hcv e2 protein with human and bovine lps (very low density, low density, and high density) enhanced the binding of both hcv e2 and lps to cd4+ lymphoblastoid (molt-4) cells, foreskin fibroblasts, and hepatocytes. the binding of hcv e2 to molt-4 cells was not enhanced when it was preincubated with lipid-free apoprotein b, which suggests that e2 interacts with the lipid moiety of human lipoproteins. the lp interaction was specific for hcv e2--incubation of hiv gp120 with lps did not enhance gp120 binding to molt-4 cells. the enhanced hcv e2 binding required expression of both human cd81 and ldlr. these data suggest that hcv e2 associates with ldl and that the resulting complex enhances binding of both ligands to cells, which may contribute to the finding that hcv-infected individuals have significantly lower levels of ldl than control subjects.
arachidonic acid at micromolar concentrations produced a drastic increase of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ros) in rat hepatoma as-30d cells cultivated in vitro along with an increase in the incidence of apoptotic cell death. both processes were prevented by trolox, a water-soluble tocopherol derivative, and tempol, a known antioxidative agent. a synthetic hybrid of lipoic acid and trolox or preincubation with n-acetylcysteine were less effective. preincubation of the cells with etomoxir, a known highly specific irreversible inhibitor of carnitine-palmitoyltransferase i, partly decreased the ros formation induced by arachidonic acid but it did not affect the increase in apoptosis. cumulatively, these results indicate that apoptosis induced in hepatoma cells by arachidonic acid is mediated by ros. they also suggest that this effect is due to arachidonic acid as such and not to its mitochondrial oxidative metabolites. arachidonic acid and, to a smaller extent, oleic acid at micromolar concentrations decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential within as-30d rat hepatoma cells cultivated in vitro and increased cell respiration. the uncoupling effect of both fatty acids on cell respiration was partly prevented by cyclosporin a, blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. arachidonic acid increased the rate of reactive oxygen species (ros) production, while oleic acid decreased it. both fatty acids induced apoptotic cell death of as-30d cells, accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and association of proapoptotic bax protein with mitochondria; arachidonic acid being a more potent inducer than oleic acid. trolox, a potent antioxidant, prevented ros increase induced by arachidonic acid and protected the cells against apoptosis produced by this fatty acid. it is concluded that arachidonic and oleic acids induce apoptosis of as-30d hepatoma cells by the mitochondrial pathway but differ in the mechanism of their action: arachidonic acid induces apoptosis mainly by stimulating ros production, whereas oleic acid may contribute to programmed cell death by activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
abstract the paper is devoted to the identification of interlaminar properties by analyzing three tests with different mode mixities on a unidirectional thermoset composite material. it is shown that by coupling digital image correlation with finite element simulations, it is possible to locally extract energy release rates whose standard uncertainty is at most equal to 50 j/m 2 . this performance is achieved with a standard finite element code by optimizing the location of the crack tip, which is the key information needed to evaluate (linear elastic) fracture mechanics parameters of these materials. the level of stress intensity factors and the experimental mode mixity can be identified in all configurations with an acceptable uncertainty. a new methodology is proposed to estimate displacement fields from pairs of images (reference and strained) that evaluates continuous displacement fields. this approach is specialized to a finite-element decomposition, therefore providing a natural interface with a numerical modeling of the mechanical behavior used for identification purposes. the method is illustrated with the analysis of portevin–le châtelier bands in an aluminum alloy sample subjected to a tensile test. a significant progress with respect to classical digital image correlation techniques is observed in terms of spatial resolution and uncertainty.
backgroundsince the modern description of femoroacetabular impingement (fai) a decade ago, surgical treatment has become increasingly common. although the ability of open treatment of fai to relieve pain and improve function has been demonstrated in a number of retrospective studies, questions remain regarding predictability of clinical outcome, the factors associated with clinical failure, and the complications associated with treatment.questions/purposeswe therefore described the change in clinical pain and function after open treatment, determined whether failure of treatment and progression of osteoarthritis was associated with outerbridge grade iv hyaline cartilage injury, and described the associated complications.methodswe retrospectively reviewed all 94 patients (96 hips) (55 males and 39 females; mean age, 28 years) who underwent surgical dislocation for femoroacetabular impingement between 2000 and 2008. seventy-two of the 96 hips had acetabular articular cartilage lesions treated with a variety of methods, most commonly resection of damaged hyaline cartilage and labral advancement. patients were followed for a minimum of 18 months (mean, 26 months; range, 18–96 months).resultsmean harris hip scores improved from 67 to 91 at final followup. six of the 96 hips (6%) were converted to arthroplasty or had worse harris hip score after surgical recovery. four of these six had outerbridge grade iv acetabular cartilage lesions and two had legg-calvé-perthes disease or slipped capital epiphysis deformities. two hips (2%) had refixation of the greater trochanter.conclusionsat short-term followup, open treatment for femoroacetabular impingement in hips without substantial acetabular hyaline cartilage damage reduced pain and improved function with a low complication rate. treatment of outerbridge grade iv acetabular cartilage delamination remains the major challenge.level of evidencelevel iv, therapeutic study. see guidelines for authors for a complete description of levels of evidence. background femoro-acetabular impingement has been associated with acetabular labral and/or articular cartilage damage that may ultimately result in osteoarthritis of the hip. surgical treatment of femoro-acetabular impingement is directed at restoring a more normal femoral head-neck offset to alleviate femoral abutment against the acetabular rim and treating associated labral and articular cartilage damage.   methods thirty hips with femoro-acetabular impingement (in twenty-nine patients) underwent débridement through a greater trochanteric flip osteotomy and anterior dislocation of the femoral head. there were sixteen male patients and thirteen female patients with a mean age of thirty-one years. cam (femoral based) impingement was noted in fourteen hips; pincer (acetabular based) impingement, in one hip; and combined cam and pincer impingement, in fifteen hips. the mean duration of clinical and radiographic follow-up was thirty-two months. all patients were followed according to a prospective protocol, with harris hip scores and plain radiographs obtained preoperatively and at six months, one year, and annually for a minimum of two years.   results the mean harris hip score improved from 70 points preoperatively to 87 points at the time of final follow-up (p < 0.0001). osteonecrosis did not develop in any hip, and there were no trochanteric nonunions. in eighteen hips, severe damage of the acetabular articular cartilage that had not been appreciated on preoperative plain radiographs or magnetic resonance arthrography was noted on arthrotomy. eight of these eighteen hips subsequently had radiographic evidence of progression of the osteoarthritis, and four of the eight hips required or were expected to soon require conversion to a total hip arthroplasty to treat progressive pain.   conclusions at the time of early follow-up, we found that surgical dislocation and débridement of the hip for the treatment of femoro-acetabular impingement in hips without substantial damage to the articular cartilage can reduce pain and improve function. this procedure has a low rate of complications. radiographic signs of progression of osteoarthritis and clinical failure requiring conversion to a total hip arthroplasty were seen only in patients with severe damage to the acetabular articular cartilage, a finding that emphasizes the need for better imaging methods to assess the extent of damage to the acetabular articular cartilage in patients with this disorder.
backgroundsurgical outcome and quality of life (qol) following perineal proctectomy for rectal prolapse remain poorly documented.methodsfrom 1994 to 2004, patients with full-thickness rectal prolapse were treated exclusively with perineal proctectomy independent of age or comorbidities. subjective patient assessments and recurrences were determined retrospectively from hospital and clinic records. consenting patients completed the gastrointestinal quality of life index (giqli).resultsperineal proctectomy was performed in 103 consecutive patients with a median age of 75 years (range 30–94). most patients underwent concurrent levatorplasty (anterior 85.8%, posterior 67.9%). durable results were obtained in all patients; the recurrence rate was 8.5% over a mean follow-up of 36 months. preoperatively, 75.5% of patients reported fecal incontinence, and 32.1% had obstructed defecation. incontinence significantly improved post-proctectomy (41.5%, p < 0.001), as did constipation (10.4%, p < 0.001). giqli respondents reported satisfaction following proctectomy with 63% scoring within one standard deviation of healthy controls. patients with recurrent prolapse reported a lower qol. risk factors for recurrence included duration of prolapse, need for posterior levatorplasty, and prior anorectal surgery.conclusionsperineal proctectomy provides significant relief from fecal incontinence and obstructive symptoms caused by rectal prolapse, with an acceptable recurrence rate and low morbidity. purpose: reports of outcome after surgery for rectal prolapse predominantly relate to single operative procedures. a single surgical operation is not appropriate for all patients with rectal prolapse. we describe a selective policy based on clinical criteria. methods: patients were offered surgery according to the following broad clinical protocol. those who were unfit for abdominal surgery had a perineal operation. the remainder had a suture abdominal rectopexy. a sigmoid resection was added for patients in whom incontinence was not a predominant symptom. results: surgery was performed in 159 patients. of these, 57 had a perineal operation, 65 had fixation rectopexy, and 37 had resection rectopexy. there were no in-hospital deaths, and major complications occurred in five patients (3.5 percent). minimum follow-up was 3 years. of the 143 patients with long-term follow-up, recurrence occurred in 7 (5 percent). constipation increased from 41 to 43 percent (59–61/143) and incontinence decreased from 43 to 19 percent (61 to 27/143). conclusions: a selective policy has improved outcome compared with reports of a single operation. future studies might consider an objective method of selecting the type of operation for rectal prolapse.
biosynthetic thiolases catalyze the condensation of two molecules acetyl‐coa to acetoacetyl‐coa and represent key enzymes for carbon–carbon bond forming metabolic pathways. an important biotechnological example of such a pathway is the clostridial n‐butanol production, comprising various natural constraints that limit titer, yield, and productivity. in this study, the thiolase of clostridium acetobutylicum, the model organism for solventogenic clostridia, was specifically engineered for reduced sensitivity towards its physiological inhibitor coenzyme a (coa‐sh). a high‐throughput screening assay in 96‐well microtiter plates was developed employing escherichia coli as host cells for expression of a mutant thiolase gene library. screening of this library resulted in the identification of a thiolase derivative with significantly increased activity in the presence of free coa‐sh. this optimized thiolase comprised three amino acid substitutions (r133g, h156n, g222v) and its gene was expressed in c. acetobutylicum atcc 824 to assess the effect of reduced coa‐sh sensitivity on solvent production. in addition to a clearly delayed ethanol and acetone formation, the ethanol and butanol titers were increased by 46% and 18%, respectively, while the final acetone concentrations were similar to the vector control strain. these results demonstrate that thiolase engineering constitutes a suitable methodology applicable to improve clostridial butanol production, but other biosynthetic pathways involving thiolase‐mediated carbon flux limitations might also be subjected to this new metabolic engineering approach. biotechnol. bioeng. 2013; 110: 887–897. © 2012 wiley periodicals, inc. the primary alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase (coded by the aad gene) is responsible for butanol formation in clostridium acetobutylicum. we complemented the non-sporulating, non-solvent-producing c. acetobutylicum m5 strain (which has lost the psol1 megaplasmid containing aad and the acetone-formation genes) with aad expressed from the phosphotransbutyrylase promoter and restored butanol production to wild type levels. because no acetone was produced, no acids (acetate or butyrate) were re-assimilated leading to high butyrate but especially acetate levels. to counter acetate production, we examined thiolase overexpression in order reduce the acetyl-coa pool and enhance the butyryl-coa pool. we combined thiolase overexpression with aad overexpression aiming to also enhance butanol formation. while limiting the formation of acetate and ethanol, the butanol titers were not improved. we also generated acetate kinase (ak) and butyrate kinase (bk) knockout (ko) mutants of m5 using a modified protocol to increase the antibiotic-resistance gene expression. these strains exhibited greater than 60% reduction in acetate or butyrate formation, respectively. we complemented the akko m5 strain with aad overexpression, but could not successfully transform the bkko m5 strain. the akko m5 strain overexpressing aad produced less acetate, but also less butanol compared to the m5 aad overexpression strain. these data suggest that loss of the psol1 megaplasmid renders cells resistant to changes in the two acid-formation pathways, and especially so for butyrate formation. we argue that the difficulty in generating high butanol producers without acetone and acid production is hindered by the inability to control the electron flow, which appears to be affected by unknown psol1 genes.
community assembly theories such as species sorting theory provide a framework for understanding the structures and dynamics of local communities. the effect of theoretical mechanisms can vary with the scales of observation and effects of specific environmental factors. based on 16s rrna gene tag pyrosequencing, different structures and temporal succession patterns were discovered between the surface sediments and bottom water microbial communities in the pearl river estuary (pre). the microbial communities in the surface sediment samples were more diverse than those in the bottom water samples, and several genera were specific for the water or sediment communities. moreover, water temperature was identified as the main variable driving community dynamics and the microbial communities in the sediment showed a greater temporal change. we speculate that nutrient-based species sorting and bacterial plasticity to the temperature contribute to the variations observed between sediment and water communities in the pre. this study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the microbial community structures in a highly dynamic estuarine system and sheds light on the applicability of ecological theoretical mechanisms. the metacommunity concept is an important way to think about linkages between different spatial scales in ecology. here we review current understanding about this concept. we first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. we then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. these have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. we then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. as ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.
curdlan sulfate (crds), a sulfated 1→3-β-d glucan, previously shown to be a potent hiv entry inhibitor, is characterized in this study as a potent inhibitor of the dengue virus (denv). crds was identified by in silico blind docking studies to exhibit binding potential to the envelope (e) protein of the denv. crds was shown to inhibit the denv replication very efficiently in different cells in vitro. minimal effective concentration of crds was as low as 0.1 µg/ml in llc-mk2 cells, and toxicity was observed only at concentrations over 10 mg/ml. crds can also inhibit denv-1, 3, and 4 efficiently. crds did not inhibit the replication of denv subgenomic replicon. time of addition experiments demonstrated that the compound not only inhibited viral infection at the host cell binding step, but also at an early post-attachment step of entry (membrane fusion). the direct binding of crds to denv was suggested by an evident reduction in the viral titers after interaction of the virus with crds following an ultrafiltration device separation, as well as after virus adsorption to an alkyl crds-coated membrane filter. the electron microscopic features also showed that crds interacted directly with the viral envelope, and caused changes to the viral surface. crds also potently inhibited denv infection in dc-sign expressing cells as well as the antibody-dependent enhancement of denv-2 infection. based on these data, a probable binding model of crds to denv e protein was constructed by a flexible receptor and ligand docking study. the binding site of crds was predicted to be at the interface between domains ii and iii of e protein dimer, which is unique to this compound, and is apparently different from the β-og binding site. since crds has already been tested in humans without serious side effects, its clinical application can be considered. preclinical studies have shown that curdlan sulphate (crds), a sulphated 1-->3-beta-d glucan, inhibits plasmodium falciparum in vitro and down-modulates the immune response. a direct, non-specific effect on cytoadherence and rosetting may be predicted, as has been described with other sulphated polysaccharides, e.g. heparin. the anticoagulant effect of crds is 10-fold lower than heparin. curdlan sulphate has, therefore, emerged as a candidate for adjunct medication in the treatment of severe/cerebral malaria. two clinical studies were conducted using crds as adjunct medication to conventional therapy (artesunate) in patients with severe and severe/cerebral malaria. both studies were double-blind and placebo-controlled to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination. curdlan sulphate appeared to reduce the severity of the disease process, e.g. fever clearance time was shortened. due to the small number of patients, there was no difference in mortality. the two treatment arms in both studies showed similar results for all laboratory parameters. the only adverse event recorded during crds treatment was an increase in activated partial thromboplastin time. this can be monitored easily. it seems that the patients who may benefit most are severe/cerebral cases with no organ damage on admission.
recent attempts to achieve fairness in predictive models focus on the balance between fairness and accuracy. in sensitive applications such as healthcare or criminal justice, this trade-off is often undesirable as any increase in prediction error could have devastating consequences. in this work, we argue that the fairness of predictions should be evaluated in context of the data, and that unfairness induced by inadequate samples sizes or unmeasured predictive variables should be addressed through data collection, rather than by constraining the model. we decompose cost-based metrics of discrimination into bias, variance, and noise, and propose actions aimed at estimating and reducing each term. finally, we perform case-studies on prediction of income, mortality, and review ratings, confirming the value of this analysis. we find that data collection is often a means to reduce discrimination without sacrificing accuracy. algorithms are now regularly used to decide whether defendants awaiting trial are too dangerous to be released back into the community. in some cases, black defendants are substantially more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly classified as high risk. to mitigate such disparities, several techniques have recently been proposed to achieve algorithmic fairness. here we reformulate algorithmic fairness as constrained optimization: the objective is to maximize public safety while satisfying formal fairness constraints designed to reduce racial disparities. we show that for several past definitions of fairness, the optimal algorithms that result require detaining defendants above race-specific risk thresholds. we further show that the optimal unconstrained algorithm requires applying a single, uniform threshold to all defendants. the unconstrained algorithm thus maximizes public safety while also satisfying one important understanding of equality: that all individuals are held to the same standard, irrespective of race. because the optimal constrained and unconstrained algorithms generally differ, there is tension between improving public safety and satisfying prevailing notions of algorithmic fairness. by examining data from broward county, florida, we show that this trade-off can be large in practice. we focus on algorithms for pretrial release decisions, but the principles we discuss apply to other domains, and also to human decision makers carrying out structured decision rules.
monitoring the water quality of recreational beaches is only one step toward understanding microbial contamination -- the primary cause of beach closings. the surf zone sediment reservoir is typically overlooked and may also be important. this study involved monitoring the fecal indicator bacteria (fib) levels in water and sediment at three ocean beaches (two exposed and one enclosed) during a storm event, conducting laboratory microcosm experiments with sediment from these beaches, and surveying sediment fib levels at 13 beaches (some exposed and some enclosed). peaks in escherichia coli and enterococci concentrations in water and sediment coincided with storm activity at the two exposed beaches, while levels of both fib were consistently high and irregular at the enclosed beach. results from microcosm experiments showing similar, dramatic growth of fib in both overlying water and sediment from all beaches, as well as results from the beach survey, support the hypothesis that the quiescent environment rather than sediment characteristics can explain the elevated sediment fib levels observed at enclosed beaches. this work has implications for the predictive value of fib measurements, and points to the importance of the sediment reservoir. waters adjacent to the county of los angeles (ca) receive untreated runoff from a series of storm drains year round. many other coastal areas face a similar situation. to our knowledge, there has not been a large-scale epidemiologic study of persons who swim in marine waters subject to such runoff. we report here results of a cohort study conducted to investigate this issue. measures of exposure included distance from the storm drain, selected bacterial indicators (total and fecal coliforms, enterococci, and escherichia coli), and a direct measure of enteric viruses. we found higher risks of a broad range of symptoms, including both upper respiratory and gastrointestinal, for subjects swimming (a) closer to storm drains, (b) in water with high levels of single bacterial indicators and a low ratio of total to fecal coliforms, and (c) in water where enteric viruses were detected. the strength and consistency of the associations we observed across various measures of exposure imply that there may be an increased risk of adverse health outcomes associated with swimming in ocean water that is contaminated with untreated urban runoff.
acid mine drainage (amd) is a global problem leading to the acidification of freshwaters, as well as contamination by heavy metals. the ability of humic substances (hs) such as humic acid (ha) to decrease toxicity of heavy metals is widely known, whereas limited studies have examined the ability of hs to decrease toxicity linked with multiple stressors such as those associated with amd. this study investigated the ability of ha to decrease acute toxicity defined as morbidity and ventilation frequency (measured via the time elapsed for ten operculum movements) in eastern rainbowfish (melanotaenia splendida splendida) exposed to the multiple stressors of amd-driven heavy metal concentrations, together with low ph. water from the mount morgan open pit (a now closed gold and copper mine site), located at mount morgan, central queensland, australia, was used as the amd source. fish were exposed to zero per cent (ph 7.3), two per cent (ph 6.7), three per cent (ph 5.7) and four per cent (ph 4.6) amd in the presence of 0, 10 and 20mg/l aldrich humic acid (aha) over 96h. ha was shown to significantly decrease the acute toxicity of amd and its adverse effects on ventilation frequency. these results are important in showing that ha can influence toxicity of metal mixtures and low ph, thus indicating a potential role for ha in decreasing toxicity of multiple environmental stressors more widely, and possible value as a rehabilitation aid. humic substances (hs) have been shown to decrease the toxicity of environmental stressors, but knowledge of their ability to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors such as metal mixtures and low ph associated with acid mine drainage (amd) is still limited. the present study investigated the ability of hs to decrease toxicity of amd to mayflies (atalophlebia spp.). the amd was collected from the mount morgan (mount morgan, queensland, australia) open pit. mayflies were exposed to concentrations of amd at 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% in the presence of 0 mg/l, 10 mg/l, and 20 mg/l aldrich humic acid (aha). a u-shaped response was noted in all aha treatments, with higher rates of mortality recorded in the 2% and 3% dilutions compared with 4%. this result was linked with increased precipitates in the lower concentrations. a follow-up trial showed significantly higher concentrations of precipitates in the 2% and 3% amd dilutions in the 0 mg/l aha treatment and higher precipitates in the 2% amd, 10 mg/l and 20 mg/l aha, treatments. humic substances were shown to significantly increase survival of mayflies exposed to amd by up to 50% in the 20 mg/l aha treatment. humic substances may have led to increased survival after amd exposure through its ability to influence animal physiology and complex heavy metals. these results are valuable in understanding the ability of hs to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors.
dietary calcium (ca) intake is needed to attain peak bone mineral density (bmd). habitual low ca intake increases intestinal ca absorption efficiency to protect bone mass, but the mechanism controlling, and the impact of genetics on, this adaptive response is not clear. we fed 11 genetically diverse inbred mouse lines a normal (0.5%) or low (0.25%) ca diet from 4 to 12 weeks of age (n = 8 per diet per line) and studied the independent and interacting effects of diet and genetics on ca and bone metabolism. significant genetic variation was observed in all bone, renal, and intestinal phenotypes measured including ca absorption. also, adaptation of ca absorption and bone parameters to low dietary ca was significantly different among the lines. ca absorption was positively correlated to femur bmd (r = 0.17, p = 0.02), and distal femur bone volume/tissue volume (bv/tv) (r = 0.34, p < 0.0001). although ca absorption was correlated to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin d (1,25(oh)2d) (r = 0.35, p < 0.0001), the adaptation of ca absorption to low ca intake did not correlate to diet‐induced adaptation of 1,25(oh)2d across the 11 lines. several intestinal proteins have been proposed to mediate ca absorption: claudins 2 and 12, voltage gated ca channel v1.3 (cav1.3), plasma membrane ca atpase 1b (pmca1b), transient receptor potential vanilloid member 6 (trpv6), and calbindin d9k (cabpd9k). only the mrna levels for trpv6, cabpd9k, and pmca1b were related to ca absorption (r = 0.42, 0.43, and 0.21, respectively). however, a significant amount of the variation in ca absorption is not explained by the current model and suggests that novel mechanisms remain to be determined. these observations lay the groundwork for discovery‐focused initiatives to identify novel genetic factors controlling gene‐by‐diet interactions affecting ca/bone metabolism. © 2014 american society for bone and mineral research. optimal intestinal calcium (ca) absorption is necessary for the protection of bone and the prevention of osteoporosis. ca absorption can be represented as the sum of a saturable pathway and a non-saturable pathway that is primarily dependent upon luminal ca concentration. while models have been proposed to describe these transport components, significant gaps still exist in our understanding of these processes. habitual low intake of ca up-regulates the saturable transport pathway, a process mediated by increased renal production of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin d (1,25(oh)2d). consistent with this, low vitamin d status as well as deletion/mutation of the vitamin d receptor (vdr) or 25 hydroxyvitamin d-1α hydroxylase (cyp27b1) genes limit ca absorption by reducing the saturable pathway. there is some evidence that non-saturable ca absorption in the ileum is also regulated by vitamin d status, but the mechanism is unclear. treatment with a number of hormones can regulate ca absorption in vivo (e.g. parathyroid hormone (pth), thyroid hormone, growth hormone (gh)/insulin-like growth factor i (igf-1), estrogen, testosterone). however, some of these actions are indirect (i.e. mediated through the regulation of vitamin d metabolism or signaling), whereas only a few (e.g. estrogen, igf-1) have been shown to persist in the absence of vitamin d signaling.
the 2 major forms of periodontitis, chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp), do not display sufficiently distinct histopathological characteristics or microbiological/ immunological features. we used molecular profiling to explore biological differences between cp and agp and subsequently carried out supervised classification using machine-learning algorithms including an internal validation. we used whole-genome gene expression profiles from 310 ‘healthy’ or ‘diseased’ gingival tissue biopsies from 120 systemically healthy non-smokers, 65 with cp and 55 with agp, each contributing with ≥ 2 ‘diseased’ gingival papillae (n = 241; with bleeding-on-probing, probing depth ≥ 4 mm, and clinical attachment loss ≥ 3 mm), and, when available, a ‘healthy’ papilla (n = 69; no bleeding-on-probing, probing depth ≤ 4 mm, and clinical attachment loss ≤ 4 mm). our analyses revealed limited differences between the gingival tissue transcriptional profiles of agp and cp, with genes related to immune responses, apoptosis, and signal transduction overexpressed in agp, and genes related to epithelial integrity and metabolism overexpressed in cp. different classifying algorithms discriminated cp from agp with an area under the curve ranging from 0.63 to 0.99. the small differences in gene expression and the highly variable classifier performance suggest limited dissimilarities between established agp and cp lesions. future analyses may facilitate the development of a novel, ‘intrinsic’ classification of periodontitis based on molecular profiling. key words: pathogenesis, gene expression, transcriptome, microarray analysis, classification, machine learning. doi: 10.1177/0022034513506011 received june 25, 2013; last revision august 27, 2013; accepted august 27, 2013 a supplemental appendix to this article is published electronically only at http://jdr.sagepub.com/supplemental. © international & american associations for dental research research reports in recent years, molecular research has translated into remarkable changes for breast cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. molecular tests such as oncotype dx® and mammaprint® have revolutionized the predictive and prognostic tools in the clinic. by stratifying the risk of recurrence for patients, the tests are able to provide clinicians with more information on the treatment outcomes of using chemotherapy, endocrine therapy or combination therapies for patients with genetic expression patterns. however, it is still questionable for clinical applications as some areas remain unclear; the true benefit still needs prospective evaluation. in this paper, the limitation and the possibility to replace traditional histopathologic features of molecular tests are discussed. at the moment, it seems there are still limitations that prevent microarrays from replacing the microscope for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of early breast cancer. however, additional important clinical information is added to traditional histology and ihc determination of er, pr and her2 in terms of prognostic and predictive power.
obesity is a multifactorial disease, with epigenetic alterations. have been described modifications in the expression of some micrornas, and some proteins related to obesity. the objective was to determine and correlate, in obese patients, the gene expression of lep, lepr, igf1, il10 and of mir-27a, mir-27b, mir-143 and mir-145. rna was extracted from biopsies of subcutaneous fat, liver and visceral fat of 15 obese subjects submitted to bariatric surgery and of 15 non-obese subjects submitted to cholecystectomy for cdna synthesis and for rt-pcr. the micrornas were chosen using the targetscan software. an increased expression of lep and igf1 was detected in the subcutaneous fat of the obese group compared to control, while the expression of igf1 was higher in the control group than in the obese one. mirna-27a had a higher expression in the omentum of the obese patients and there was also a correlation in the expression of mirna-145 and lepr in the omentum of this group. objectives: we investigated the effect of obesity on the serum levels of total and free igf-1 and their relationship to the circulating levels of insulin and igf binding proteins (igfbps) in age and sex-matched groups. subjects: the study included 43 obese subjects (ideal body weight; ibw>120%) and 45 controls (ibw<100%). all of the subjects were male. measurement: total igf-1, free igf-1, igfbp-1, igfbp-2, igfbp-3, and insulin were measured in obese subjects and normal control subjects. results: no significant differences in the circulating levels of total and igfbp-3 were observed between the obese and control groups. in contrast to total igf-1, free igf-1 in obese subjects was significantly increased compared to normal controls (p<0.05). serum total and free igf-1 were inversely correlated with age (r=−0.42, p=0.001, and −0.44, p=0.001). fasting serum insulin concentrations were elevated in all the obese subjects (p<0.05) and positively correlated with ibw (r=0.57, p=0.001). the levels of serum gh and igfbp-1 were suppressed in all the obese subjects (p<0.05). igfbp-1 was inversely correlated with ibw (r=−0.51, p=0.001) and serum insulin concentrations (r=minus;0.48, p=0.001). the igfbp-2 concentrations were also suppressed in obese subjects and inversely related to free igf-1 (r=−0.48, p=0.001). using multiple linear regression analysis, total igf-1 and insulin concentrations were positively correlated (r=0.58, p=0.001) and free igf-1 and igfbp-1 concentrations were negatively correlated (r=−0.57, p=0.001). conclusion: we confirmed that total igf-1 and igfbp-3 concentrations were not significantly different between the obese and control groups, despite gh hyposecretion in obesity. we also found that free igf-1 concentrations were higher in obese subjects than in normal controls. it seems likely that overnutrition and chronic hyperinsulinaemia in obesity may alter this regulated growth response by insulin stimulation of igf-1 production and suppression of hepatic igfbp-1 and igfbp-2 production, which may inhibit igf-1 bioactivity.
tar-dna-binding protein-43 (tdp-43) c-terminus encodes a prion-like domain widely presented in rna-binding proteins, which functions to form dynamic oligomers and also, amazingly, hosts most amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als)-causing mutations. here, as facilitated by our previous discovery, by circular dichroism (cd), fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy, we have successfully determined conformations, dynamics, and self-associations of the full-length prion-like domains of the wild type and three als-causing mutants (a315e, q331k, and m337v) in both aqueous solutions and membrane environments. the study decodes the following: (1) the tdp-43 prion-like domain is intrinsically disordered only with some nascent secondary structures in aqueous solutions, but owns the capacity to assemble into dynamic oligomers rich in β-sheet structures. by contrast, despite having highly similar conformations, three mutants gained the ability to form amyloid oligomers. the wild type and three mutants all formed amyloid fibrils after incubation as imaged by electron microscopy. (2) the interaction with nucleic acid enhances the self-assembly for the wild type but triggers quick aggregation for three mutants. (3) a membrane-interacting subdomain has been identified over residues met311-gln343 indispensable for tdp-43 neurotoxicity, which transforms into a well-folded ω-loop-helix structure in membrane environments. furthermore, despite having very similar membrane-embedded conformations, three mutants will undergo further self-association in the membrane environment. our study implies that the tdp-43 prion-like domain appears to have an energy landscape, which allows the assembly of the wild-type sequence into dynamic oligomers only under very limited condition sets, and als-causing point mutations are sufficient to remodel it to more favor the amyloid formation or irreversible aggregation, thus supporting the emerging view that the pathologic aggregation may occur via the exaggeration of functionally important assemblies. furthermore, the coupled capacity of tdp-43 in aggregation and membrane interaction may critically account for its high neurotoxicity, and therefore its decoupling may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to treat tdp-43 causing neurodegenerative diseases. glutamine/asparagine (q/n)-rich domains have a high propensity to form self-propagating amyloid fibrils. this phenomenon underlies both prion-based inheritance in yeast and aggregation of a number of proteins involved in human neurodegenerative diseases. to examine the prevalence of this phenomenon, complete proteomic sequences of 31 organisms and several incomplete proteomic sequences were examined for q/n-rich regions. we found that q/n-rich regions are essentially absent from the thermophilic bacterial and archaeal proteomes. moreover, the average q/n content of the proteins in these organisms is markedly lower than in mesophilic bacteria and eukaryotes. mesophilic bacterial proteomes contain a small number (0-4) of proteins with q/n-rich regions. remarkably, q/n-rich domains are found in a much larger number of eukaryotic proteins (107-472 per proteome) with diverse biochemical functions. analyses of these regions argue they have been evolutionarily selected perhaps as modular "polar zipper" protein-protein interaction domains. these data also provide a large pool of potential novel prion-forming proteins, two of which have recently been shown to behave as prions in yeast, thus suggesting that aggregation or prion-like regulation of protein function may be a normal regulatory process for many eukaryotic proteins with a wide variety of functions.
backgroundpancreatic cancer is among the top 5 most common cancers worldwide, but is particularly devastating due to its insidious nature. complete surgical resection remains the only potential curative treatment, although only 20 % of patients present with a resectable tumor. patients may alternatively present with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer or locally advanced pancreatic cancer and can be offered treatment with neoadjuvant intent. the effectiveness of these treatments is unclear and there is a paucity of data to suggest one optimal treatment approach.case presentationwe describe a 61-year-old female who presented with a two-week history of obstructive jaundice in the context of vague abdominal pain that had been ongoing for years prior to her visit. ct scan of the abdomen confirmed a hypovascular mass in the uncinate process consistent with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. pancreatic adenocarcinoma was confirmed with endoscopic ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration cytology. following multidisciplinary discussion, it was recommended that she undergo treatment with folfirinox. after a total of 13 cycles, follow up ct revealed that the lesion had decreased in size and she was offered resection as a potentially curative treatment. she underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. final pathology report revealed no evidence of residual adenocarcinoma (ypt0 ypn0 (0/23)). the patient remains disease-free 15 months following surgery.conclusionto date, there have been very few reports of a complete pathological response following neoadjuvant therapy in borderline resectable or locally advanced pancreatic cancer. this report describes a unique case of a complete pathological remission in a patient with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer following folfirinox therapy alone and adds to the growing base of evidence meriting the initiation of clinical trials to assess the efficacy of folfirinox in these subsets of pancreatic cancer. background pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pda) has a very poor prognosis. treatment with folfirinox has been shown to improve outcomes, but can be associated with significant toxicity.   materials and methods a retrospective review was performed of all patients with locally advanced or metastatic pda treated with folfirinox at the royal marsden between november 2010 and november 2013. efficacy, tolerability, and potential prognostic factors were evaluated.   results twenty-seven patients with metastatic pda and 22 patients with locally advanced pda were treated with folfirinox. patients received a median of 9 cycles (range, 1-26) of folfirinox. the overall response rate was 41% (20 patients), and a further 17 patients (35%) had stable disease. thirty-five patients (71%) received folfirinox in the first-line setting, with a median progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively, of 12.9 months and 18.4 months for patients with locally advanced disease; and 8.4 months and 12.2 months for patients with metastatic disease. the most frequently occurring grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (29%), fatigue (18%), febrile neutropenia (14%), thromboembolism (12%), and thrombocytopenia (10%). in a univariate analysis, reduction in ca 19-9 of >50% (p < .001), normalization of ca19-9 (p < .001), surgery after folfirinox (p = .004), and use of prophylactic pegfilgrastim (p = .005) were prognostic for overall survival.   conclusion the efficacy and tolerability of folfirinox for pda at our institution is similar to that reported in clinical trials. careful selection of patients and monitoring of response (according to ca19-9) and toxicities can help maximize advantage in this patient population.
in this paper we reconsider the relationship between income on health, taking a distributional perspective rather than one centered on conditional expectation. using structured additive distributional regression, we find that the association between income on health is larger than generally estimated because aspects of the conditional health distribution that go beyond the expectation imply worse outcomes for those with lower incomes. looking at german data from the socio economic panel, we find that the risk of very bad health is roughly halved when doubling the net equivalent income from 15,000 euro to 30,000 euro, which is more than tenfold of the magnitude of change found when considering expected health measures. this paper therefore argues that when studying health outcomes, a distributional perspective that considers stochastic variation among observationally equivalent individuals is warranted. background. reliably mapping from generic or diseasespecific health status measures into health state utilities would assist health economists. existing studies mainly use ordinary least squares (ols) regression equations to predict utility values for particular health states. the authors examine an alternative approach tomap between 2 generic health status instruments, the sf-12 and the eq-5d. methods. multinomial logit regression is used to estimate the probability that a respondent will select a particular level of response to questions in the eq-5d, using individual question responses and summary scores from the sf-12 as predictors. monte carlo simulation methods are used to generate predicted eq-5d responses, and utility scores (tariffs) are then attached. results are comparedwithanalternativeapproach based on direct mapping to utility scores using ols. data. the authors estimate equations using 12,967 adult survey responses-from the 2000 us medical expenditure panel survey. they report mean squared error (mse) andmean absolute error (mae) of their predicted utilitieswithin this sample, and out-of-sample using 13,304 adults from the 1996 health survey for england. results. the authors obtain an in-sample and out-of-sample mse of 0.03, compared with 0.02 for the ols approach. their mae of 0.11 is similar to ols results. the authors’ method predicts groupmean utility scores and differentiates between groups with or without known existing illness. conclusions. the authors’ approach has higher mse than the direct ols approach but givesmore descriptive data on domains of health effects. further outofsample prediction work will help test the validity of these methods.
leaf, root, stem, petiole, hypocotyl, and zygotic embryo explants, as well as pollen embryoids, and redifferentiated tissues from pollen embryoid-derived plantlets of hyoscyamus niger l. (black henbane) were inoculated with agrobacterium tumefaciens, harboring binary vectors (pgs gluc1) and then cultured on media containing kanamycin. transient β-glucuronidase activity and kanamycin resistant callus formation were influenced by explant origin. transgenic calluses were obtained at a frequency of up to 30% from all the explants tested. however, transgenic shoots were obtained only from the hypocotyl of plantlets derived from pollen embryoids. transformation was confirmed by the ability of leaf segments to produce kanamycin resistant calluses, β-glucuronidase histochemical and flurometric assays, polymerase chain reaction and southern blot analysis. the results show that pollen embryoid-derived explants may be an alternative source for both efficient transformation and regeneration of transgenic plants in recalcitrant species. this work describes a new method to obtain transgenic somatic embryos fromagrobacterium-infected immature zygotic embryos ofdatura innoxia. it has several advantages over previous transformation methods such as the absence of a callus phase, an average transformation rate of 76% and a high regeneration frequency. critical steps for optimal transformation were the embryo stage and a short preculture treatment. the marker gene β-glucuronidase and light microscopy were used to identify the competent embryogenic cells which, after transformation, passed through the classical stages of embryo development. the transgenes were transmitted to the progeny in a mendelian fashion. the plants regenerated via direct somatic embryogenesis were cytologically and morphologically uniform. we also observed that: (1) wounding or wound-induced divisions were not required for zygotic embryo transformation; (2) epidermal cells were competent for both transformation and regeneration; and (3) competency foragrobacterium infection was developmental stage-specific. this new method should facilitate the development of new strategies to routinely transform recalcitrant plant species.
we have analyzed development of mechanical hyperalgesia after repeated systemic lipopolysaccharide (lps) injections and correlated these findings with stimulation of astrocytes and microglia in spinal cord. male lewis rats received a single or seven intraperitoneal injections of lps. mechanical hyperalgesia was measured as rat hindpaw withdrawal thresholds (pwts). we observed that a single lps injection elicited a specific change of pwts while stimulated spinal glial activation was identified by immunoreactivities of specific markers, ed1, p2x4 receptor, endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide ii (emap ii) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap), respectively; multiple lps treatments induced tolerance to mechanical hyperalgesia, whereas expression of ed1 and gfap were further increased. in conclusion, we have demonstrated that the number of activated spinal glial cells was increased as an acute effect of lps correlating with increased sensitivity to mechanical stimulation. however chronic exposure to lps can develop a tolerance to mechanical hyperalgesia despite ongoing signs of cns glial activation. the most characteristic feature of microglial cells is their rapid activation in response to even minor pathological changes in the cns. microglia activation is a key factor in the defence of the neural parenchyma against infectious diseases, inflammation, trauma, ischaemia, brain tumours and neurodegeneration. microglia activation occurs as a graded response in vivo. the transformation of microglia into potentially cytotoxic cells is under strict control and occurs mainly in response to neuronal or terminal degeneration, or both. activated microglia are mainly scavenger cells but also perform various other functions in tissue repair and neural regeneration. they form a network of immune alert resident macrophages with a capacity for immune surveillance and control. activated microglia can destroy invading micro-organisms, remove potentially deleterious debris, promote tissue repair by secreting growth factors and thus facilitate the return to tissue homeostasis. an understanding of intercellular signalling pathways for microglia proliferation and activation could form a rational basis for targeted intervention on glial reactions to injuries in the cns.
no consistent conclusions have been drawn from existing studies regarding the effectiveness of different approaches to learning from imbalanced data. in this paper we apply bias-variance analysis to study the utility of different strategies for imbalanced learning. we conduct experiments on 15 real-world imbalanced datasets of applying various re-sampling and induction bias adjustment strategies to the standard decision tree, naive bayes and k-nearest neighbour (k-nn) learning algorithms. our main findings include: imbalanced class distribution is primarily a high bias problem, which partly explains why it impedes the performance of many standard learning algorithms. compared to the re-sampling strategies, adjusting induction bias can more significantly vary the bias and variance components of classification errors. especially the inverse distance weighting strategy can significantly reduce the variance errors for k-nn. based on these findings we offer practical advice on applying the re-sampling and induction bias adjustment strategies to improve imbalanced learning. we present a comprehensive suite of experimentation on the subject of learning from imbalanced data. when classes are imbalanced, many learning algorithms can suffer from the perspective of reduced performance. can data sampling be used to improve the performance of learners built from imbalanced data? is the effectiveness of sampling related to the type of learner? do the results change if the objective is to optimize different performance metrics? we address these and other issues in this work, showing that sampling in many cases will improve classifier performance.
loss of mitotic checkpoint of cells contributes to chromosomal instability and leads to carcinogenesis. mitotic arrest deficient 1 (mad1) is a key component in mitotic checkpoint signalling. in this study, we identified a novel mad1 interacting partner, proline‐rich acidic protein 1 (prap1), using yeast‐two hybrid screening, and investigated its role in mitotic checkpoint signalling in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). we demonstrated the physical interaction of prap1 with mad1 and of prap1 with mad1 isoform mad1β, using a co‐immunoprecipitation assay. moreover, stable expression of prap1 in mitotic checkpoint‐competent hcc cells, bel‐7402 and smmc‐7721, induced impairment of the mitotic checkpoint (p < 0.01), formation of chromosome bridges (p < 0.01) and aberrant chromosome numbers (p < 0.001). interestingly, ectopic expression prap1 in hcc cells led to significant under‐expression of mad1. in human hcc tumours, 40.4% (23/57) of hccs showed under‐expression of prap1 protein as compared with their corresponding non‐tumorous livers; up‐regulation of mad1 protein was significantly associated with down‐regulation of prap1 (p = 0.030). our data revealed that prap1 is a protein interacting partner of mad1 and that prap1 is able to down‐regulate mad1 and suppress mitotic checkpoint signalling in hcc. published by john wiley & sons, ltd. www.pathsoc.org.uk motivation genes are often characterized dichotomously as either housekeeping or single-tissue specific. we conjectured that crucial functional information resides in genes with midrange profiles of expression.   results to obtain such novel information genome-wide, we have determined the mrna expression levels for one of the largest hitherto analyzed set of 62 839 probesets in 12 representative normal human tissues. indeed, when using a newly defined graded tissue specificity index tau, valued between 0 for housekeeping genes and 1 for tissue-specific genes, genes with midrange profiles having 0.15< tau<0.85 were found to constitute >50% of all expression patterns. we developed a binary classification, indicating for every gene the i(b) tissues in which it is overly expressed, and the 12-i(b) tissues in which it shows low expression. the 85 dominant midrange patterns with i(b)=2-11 were found to be bimodally distributed, and to contribute most significantly to the definition of tissue specification dendrograms. our analyses provide a novel route to infer expression profiles for presumed ancestral nodes in the tissue dendrogram. such definition has uncovered an unsuspected correlation, whereby de novo enhancement and diminution of gene expression go hand in hand. these findings highlight the importance of gene suppression events, with implications to the course of tissue specification in ontogeny and phylogeny.   availability all data and analyses are publically available at the genenote website, http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/genenote/ and, geo accession gse803.   contact doron.lancet@weizmann.ac.il   supplementary information four tables available at the above site.
araucaria araucana (molina) k. koch is a conifer distributed in the andean-patagonian forests in the south of argentina and chile. the main objective of this work was to relate the different root classes appearing in a. araucana to mycorrhizal behavior. samples were collected in three different sites in the lanín national park (nw patagonia, argentina). two different root classes were present in a. araucana: longitudinal fine roots (lfr) and globular short roots (gsr). both had extensive mycorrhizal arbuscular symbiosis (am) and presented abundant hyphae and coils in root cells, a characteristic of the anatomical paris-type. dark septate fungal endophytes were also observed. values of total am colonization were high, with similar partial am% values for each root class. seasonal differences were found for total and partial colonization, with higher values in spring compared to autumn. regarding the percentage of fungal structures between root classes, values were similar for vesicles and arbuscules, but higher coil percentages were observed in gsr compared to lfr. the percentages of vesicles increased in autumn, whereas the arbuscule percentages increased in spring, coinciding with the plant growth peak. results show that both root classes of a. araucana in andean-patagonian forests are associated with am fungi, which may have ecological relevance in terms of the importance of this symbiosis, in response to soil nutrient-deficiencies, especially high p-retention. summaryroots of 76 plant species collected in west spitsbergen (svalbard), in the middle-northern arctic zone, were examined for mycorrhiza and root-associated fungi. dryas octopetala, pedicularis dasyantha and salix polaris were ectomycorrhizal and cassiope tetragona and empetrum hermaphroditum ericoid mycorrhizal. pedicularis dasyantha was only slightly infected. structures resembling vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (vam) fungi were not found in the roots, and soil samples screened for vam fungi contained only one spore. root endophytic fungi commonly occurred in spits-bergen, but only olpidium brassicae, pleospora herbarum, papulaspora, microdochium bolleyi and rhizoctonia solani were identified with reasonable certainty. a sterile endophytic dark-septate fungus (dsf) was in 39.5% of the flowering-plant species examined, especially in the brassicaceae, caryophyllaceae, saxifragaceae and poaceae. dsf were categorized into four slightly overlapping groups. sterile endophytic hyaline septate fungi were rare. in the literature it is suggested that at least some of the dsf species or the hyaline septate fungi are functionally mutualistic rather than saprophytic or pathogenic. the literature on ectomycorrhizal fungi and plants in spitsbergen is reviewed, including about 50 species, mainly of the genera cortinarius, hebeloma, inocybe, laccaria, lactarius and russula. these are symbiotic with the above-mentioned ectomycorrhizal plants. four further ectomycorrhizal plants (betula nana, salix spp.) are very rare in the area.
abstract in fission yeast, overexpression of the replication initiator protein cdc18p induces re-replication, a phenotype characterized by continuous dna synthesis in the absence of cell division. in contrast, overexpression of cdc6p, the budding yeast homolog of cdc18p, does not cause re-replication in s. cerevisiae. however, we have found that cdc6p has the ability to induce re-replication in fission yeast. cdc6p cannot functionally replace cdc18p, but instead interferes with the proteolysis of both cdc18p and rum1p, the inhibitor of the protein kinase cdc2p. this activity of cdc6p is entirely contained within a short n-terminal peptide, which forms a tight complex with cdc2p and the f-box/wd-repeat protein sud1p/pop2p, a component of the scfpop ubiquitin ligase in fission yeast. these interactions are mediated by two distinct regions within the n-terminal region of cdc6p and depend on the integrity of its cdc2p phosphorylation sites. the data suggest that disruption of re-replication control by overexpression of cdc6p in fission yeast is a consequence of sequestration of cdc2p and pop2p, two factors involved in the negative regulation of rum1p, cdc18p and potentially other replication proteins. p25rum1 from the fission yeast s. pombe is shown to act as a specific in vitro inhibitor of the p34cdc2/p56cdc13 mitotic kinase. it is also shown that early g1 cells contain p25rum1, which associates with and inhibits the mitotic kinase, and maintains p56cdc13 mitotic b cyclin at a low level, ensuring that these cells do not undergo a premature lethal entry into mitosis. a high level of p25rum1 in g2 cells inhibits the p34cdc2/p56cdc13 kinase that removes the block preventing a further s phase and leads to repeated rounds of dna replication. thus, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p25rum1, acting on the p34cdc2 mitotic kinase, plays an important role in ensuring the correct sequence of s phase and mitosis during the cell cycle.
backgroundto investigate the impact of weekly screening within the bundle of infection control measures to terminate vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) transmissions on an oncologic ward.methodsa cluster of 12 vre colonisation and five infections was detected on an oncologic ward between january and april 2015. subsequently, the vre point prevalence was detected and, as part of a the bundle of infection control strategies to terminate the vre cluster, we isolated affected patients, performed hand hygiene training among staff on ward, increased observations by infection control specialists, intensified surface disinfection, used personal protective equipment and initiated an admission screening in may 2015. after a further nosocomial vre infection in august 2015, a weekly screening strategy of all oncology patients on the respective ward was established while admission screening was continued. whole genome sequencing (wgs)-based typing was applied to determine the clonal relationship of isolated strains.resultsinitially, 12 of 29 patients were vre colonised; of these 10 were hospital-acquired. during may to august, on average 7 of 40 patients were detected to be vre colonised per week during the admission screening, showing no significant decline compared to the initial situation. wgs-based typing revealed five different clusters of which three were due to vanb- and two vana-positive enterococci. after an additional weekly screening was established, the number of colonised patients significantly declined to 1/53 and no further nosocomial cases were detected.conclusionsweekly screening helped to differentiate between nosocomial and community-acquired vre cases resulting in earlier infection control strategies on epidemic situations for a successful termination of nosocomial vre transmissions. abstract infections attributable to vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains have become increasingly prevalent over the past decade. prompt identification of colonized patients combined with effective multifaceted infection control practices can reduce the transmission of vre and aid in the prevention of hospital-acquired infections (hais). increasingly, the clinical microbiology laboratory is being asked to support infection control efforts through the early identification of potential patient or environmental reservoirs. this review discusses the factors that contribute to the rise of vre as an important health care-associated pathogen, the utility of laboratory screening and various infection control strategies, and the available laboratory methods to identify vre in clinical specimens.
backgroundcorrect treatment of potentially life-threatening illnesses (pltis) in children under 5 years, such as malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea, can substantially reduce mortality. the integrated management of childhood illness (imci) strategy has been shown to improve treatment of child illnesses, but multiple studies have shown that gaps in health worker performance remain after training. to better understand factors related to health worker performance, we analyzed 9,330 patient consultations in benin from 2001–2002, after training one of the first cohorts of 32 health workers in imci.methodswith data abstracted from patient registers specially designed for imci-trained health workers, we examined associations between health facility-, health worker-, and patient-level factors and 10 case-management outcomes for pltis.resultsaltogether, 63.6 % of children received treatment for all their pltis in accordance with imci guidelines, and 77.8 % received life-saving treatment (i.e., clinically effective treatment, even if not exactly in accordance with imci guidelines). performance of individual health workers varied greatly, from 15–88 % of patients treated correctly, on average. multivariate regression analyses identified several factors that might have influenced case-management quality, many outside a manager’s direct control. younger health workers significantly outperformed older ones, and infants received better care than older children. children with danger signs, those with more complex illnesses, and those with anemia received worse care. health worker supervision was associated with improved performance for some outcomes.conclusionsa variety of factors, some outside the direct control of program managers, can influence health worker practices. an understanding of these influences can help inform the development of strategies to improve performance. objectives to prepare for the implementation of integrated management of childhood illness (imci) in benin, we studied the management of ill children younger than 5 years at outpatient health facilities.   methods we observed a representative sample of consultations; after each consultation, we interviewed caregivers and reexamined children. health workers' performance was evaluated against imci guidelines. to identify determinants of performance, statistical modeling was performed and 6 focus groups with health workers were conducted to solicit their opinions.   results altogether, 584 children were enrolled and 101 health workers were observed; 130 health workers participated in focus group discussions. many serious deficiencies were found: incomplete assessment of children's signs and symptoms, incorrect diagnosis and treatment of potentially life-threatening illnesses, inappropriate prescription of dangerous sedatives, missed opportunities to vaccinate, and failure to refer severely ill children for hospitalization. quantitative and qualitative analyses showed various health facility-, health worker-, caregiver-, and child-related factors as possible determinants of health worker performance.   conclusions action is urgently needed. our results suggest that to improve health care delivery, interventions should target both the health system and the community level.
for a generic flexible efficient array antenna receiver platform a hierarchical reconfigurable tiled architecture has been proposed. the architecture provides a flexible reconfigurable solution, but partitioning, mapping, modelling and programming such systems remains an issue. a semantic model has been presented to allow the development of the model for the specification, design and implementation. the semantic model is used for partitioning the application, evaluating the consequences and mapping to an architectures. design space exploration allows us to adapt the partitioning and mapping to an architecture or visa-versa.    with tiled reconfigurable cores as basis for the architecture, this paper explores the different options for processing cores and its suitability with respect to the design flow of the semantic model approach. trade-offs with respect to granularity depending on flexibility and efficiency allow interesting design evaluations, especially for programability. this work therefore represent an important step forward in the design flow for designing and using multi-core tiled architectures. parallel computing teaching has an important difficulty, there are few tools to directly learn the behavior of the parallel algorithms and the parallel architectures. normally the student is formed to think in sequential algorithms running in sequential machines. we present psee, a tool to reduce the gap between the basic concepts and its utilization. psee is an integrated and interactive graphic environment which allows to simulate and evaluate the performance of parallel algorithms in parallel architectures. psee permits to manage the main characteristic parameters involved in the system in order to show the tuning grade of the algorithm/architecture couple. psee includes a graphic editor for algorithms and architectures in modelled form, an interactive simulator to run (simulate) the algorithm on the architecture and a performance evaluation instrument.
abstract. in β-lactam producing microorganisms, the first step in the biosynthesis of the β-lactam ring is the condensation of three amino acid precursors: α-aminoadipate, l-cysteine and d-valine. in nocardia lactamdurans and other cephamycin-producing actinomycetes, α-aminoadipate is generated from l-lysine by two sequential enzymatic steps. the first step involves a lysine-6-aminotransferase activity (lat), considered to be one of the rate-limiting steps for antibiotic biosynthesis. here, we report the effect of exogenous lysine on antibiotic production by n. lactamdurans ma4213. lysine-supplemented cultures showed higher titers of cephamycin c, an effect that was more significant at early fermentation times. the increase in cephamycin c production was not quantitatively correlated with specific lat activity in lysine-supplemented cultures. observation of a positive effect of lysine on cephamycin c production by n. lactamdurans was dependent on carbon source availability in the culture media. supplementation of the culture media with exogenous lysine did not affect the mrna levels of the early biosynthetic genes controlled by the bidirectional promoter. these results indicate that l-lysine is required not only for antibiotic biosynthesis, but particularly as carbon or nitrogen source. abstractl-lysine is known to stimulate production of β-lactam antibiotics bystreptomyces clavuligerus via provision of the lysine breakdown product,l-α-aminoadipic acid, which is a limiting precursor. previous investigations utilized levels of 10–20 mml-lysine as an addition to chemically-defined media resulting in 50–100% improvement in antibiotic production. we were surprised to note that as the concentration was further increased, the organism responded by producing even higher titers of antibiotics. the optimum concentration of 100 mml-lysine yielded an approximate 500% increase in production with only minor effects on growth.dl- andd-lysine also exerted enhancements suggesting the presence of a lysine racemase or some other route fromd-lysine tol-α-aminoadipate in this organism;d-lysine was considerably less potent thandl- orl-lysine.
incidences of adverse cardiac events and orthostatic hypotension are associated with diurnal variations. the primary purpose of the present study was to determine if the vestibulosympathetic reflex (vsr) follows a diurnal variation in humans. we hypothesized that the vsr would be attenuated at night based on the relation between melatonin and the vsr. arterial blood pressure, heart rate, calf blood flow, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (msna) were measured in nine healthy subjects (28 ± 1 yr, 5 men and 4 women) at rest and during head-down rotation. each subject was tested during the day at 11:34 ± 13 and again at night 22:10 ± 5. msna was significantly decreased at night compared with day (8 ± 1 vs. 11 ± 2 bursts/min, respectively, p < 0.02). heart rate and arterial blood pressure at rest were significantly increased at night compared with day (heart rate: 70 ± 4 vs. 66 ± 4 beats/min and mean arterial blood pressure: 91 ± 2 vs. 87 ± 1 mmhg, respectively). msna and hemodynamic responses to head-down rotation were not significantly altered at night compared with day (changes of 3 ± 1 bursts/min and 25 ± 6% for msna and calf blood flow, respectively). the data indicate that msna at rest decreases during the late evening hours and exhibits a diurnal variation, whereas the vsr does not. in summary, diurnal variation of orthostatic hypotension in humans does not appear to be associated with changes in the vsr and msna at rest. melatonin has been reported to decrease nerve activity of medial vestibular nuclei in the rat and is associated with attenuated muscle sympathetic nerve activity (msna) responses to baroreceptor unloading in humans. the purpose of this study was to determine if melatonin alters the vestibulosympathetic reflex (vsr) and vestibulocollic reflex (vcr) in humans. in study 1, msna, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were measured in 12 healthy subjects (28 ± 1 yr; 6 men, 6 women) during head-down rotation (hdr) before and 45 min after ingestion of either melatonin (3 mg) or placebo (sucrose). subjects returned at least 2 days later at the same time of day to repeat the trial after ingesting the opposite treatment (melatonin or placebo). melatonin significantly attenuated msna responses during hdr compared with placebo (burst frequency δ 4 ± 1 vs. δ 7 ± 1 bursts/min, and total msna δ 51 ± 20 and δ 96 ± 15%, respectively; p < 0.02). in study 2, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (vemp) were measured in 10 healthy subjects (26 ± 1 yr; 4 men and 6 women) before and after ingestion of 3 mg melatonin. melatonin did not alter the timing of the p13 and n23 peaks (pre-melatonin 13.2 ± 0.4 and 21.3 ± 0.6 ms vs. post-melatonin 13.5 ± 0.4 and 21.4 ± 0.7 ms, respectively) or the p13-n23 interpeak amplitudes [pre-melatonin 22.5 ± 4.6 arbitrary units (au) and post-melatonin 22.7 ± 4.6 au]. in summary, melatonin attenuates the vsr and supports the concept that melatonin negatively affects orthostatic tolerance. however, melatonin does not alter the vcr in humans suggesting melatonin's effect on the vsr appears to be mediated by the utricles.
objectivesthis study aimed to determine the degree of conversion (dc) of two nano-hybrid resin-based composites (rbcs) with novel monomer composition based on dimer acid derivates (hydrogenated dimer acid) and tricyclodecane–urethane structure compared to three nano-hybrid materials containing conventional matrices. dc was evaluated at 0.1, 2, and 6 mm depth at varying irradiation times (10, 20, and 40 s) and layering techniques (bulk and incremental).materials and methodsdc was measured in real time by a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) spectrometer with attenuated total reflectance accessory. the ftir spectra were recorded on the bottom of the samples in real time for 5 min from photoinitiation. results were compared using one- and multiple-way anova, tukey's hsd post hoc test (α = 0.05), and partial eta-squared statistic.resultsafter 5 min of measurement, dc showed no significant difference by varying cure time for specimens of 0.1 mm thickness. at 2 mm depth, the dc significantly increased after a cure time of 20 s compared to 10 s, remaining equal after 40 s of irradiation. at 6 mm depth, bulk curing showed significantly lower dc compared to incremental curing for all polymerization times. specimen geometry revealed a strong effect on dc (η2 = 0.90) followed by curing time (η2 = 0.39).conclusionsthe rbcs containing the dimer acid and tricyclodecane–urethane structure showed a relatively low decrease of dc with increasing incremental thickness compared to the conventionally formulated materials. the former reached the highest dc among the tested materials.clinical relevancefor the tested rbcs, increments of 2 mm and irradiation time of at least 20 s may be recommended for clinical practice. the two materials containing novel monomer composition might be applied for enlarged increments because of the low decrease of dc they demonstrated for 6-mm increments. objective the objective of this study was to compare the microstructures of teeth, natural opals, and opal dental enamel porcelains to examine the mechanisms that cause opalescence.   method and materials four dental porcelains, a natural opal mineral, and a human tooth were examined. replicas were assessed in transmission electron microscopy for features that would cause opalescence. enamel dental porcelains denoted as "light" were selected for the study. x-ray diffraction and color analyses of the porcelains were also performed.   results all the materials were opalescent, to varying degrees. the porcelains with fewer microscopic features were less opalescent. the presence of dispersed particles or a phase-separated glass was found to cause opalescence in dental porcelains.   conclusion a phase-separated glass in one enamel porcelain best resembled the microstructure of natural opal mineral and teeth, and this was the most "opalescent" material.
the hydrophobic character and electrophoretic mobility (epm) of microorganisms are vital aspects of understanding their interactions with the environment. these properties are fundamental in fate-and-transport, physiological, and virulence studies, and thus integral in surrogate selection. hydrophobic and electrostatic forces are significant contributors to particle and microorganism mobility in the environment. herein, the surface properties of commonly used bacillus anthracis surrogate endospores were tested under comparable conditions with respect to culture, endospore purification, buffer type and strength. additionally, data is presented of endospores suspended in dechlorinated tap water to evaluate the surrogates in regard to a breach of water infrastructure security. the surface properties of b. anthracis were found to be the most hydrophobic and least electronegative among the six bacillus species tested across buffer strength. the effect of epm on hydrophobicity varies in a species-specific manner. this study demonstrates that surrogate surface properties differ and care must be taken when choosing the most suitable surrogate. moreover, it is shown that bacillus thuringensis best represents bacillus anthracis-sterne with respect to both epm and hydrophobicity across all test buffers. this study was designed to elucidate the influence of spore properties such as the presence of an exosporium, on their ability to adhere to materials. this analysis was performed on 17 strains belonging to the b. cereus group and to less related bacillus species. we first demonstrated that spores of the b. cereus group, surrounded by an exosporium, differed in their morphological features such as exosporium size, number of appendages or hair-like nap length. we also found that the saccharidic composition of exosporium differed among strains, e.g. concerning a newly identified rhamnose derivative: the 2,4-o-dimethyl-rhamnose. conversely, spores of distant bacillus species shared morphological and physico-chemical properties with b. cereus spores. some external features were also observed on these spores, such as a thin loose-fitting layer, whose nature is still to be determined, or a thick saccharidic layer (mainly composed of rhamnose and quinovose). the ability of spores to adhere to stainless steel varied among strains, those belonging to the b. cereus group generally being the most adherent. however, the presence of an exosporium is not sufficient to explain the ability of spores to adhere to inanimate surfaces. indeed, when the 17 strains were compared, hydrophobicity and the number of appendages were the only significant adhesion parameters. furthermore, the differences in spore adhesion observed within the b. cereus group were related to differences in the number of appendages, the exosporium length and to a lesser extent, the zeta potential.
nitric oxide (no) diffuses as short-lived messenger through the plasma membrane and serves, among many other functions, as an activator of the cgmp synthesizing enzyme soluble guanylyl cyclase (sgc). in view of recent genetic investigations that postulated a retrograde signal from the larval muscle fibers to the presynaptic terminals, we looked for the presence of an no/cgmp signaling system at the neuromuscular junction (nmj) of drosophila melanogaster larvae. application of no donors induced cgmp immunoreactivity in the presynaptic terminals but not the postsynaptic muscle fibers at an identified nmj. the no-induced cgmp immunoreactivity was sensitive to a specific inhibitor (odq) of the sgc. since presynaptic terminals which were surgically isolated from the central nervous system are capable of synthesizing cgmp, we suggest that an no-sensitive guanylyl cyclase is present in the terminal arborizations. using a fluorescent dye that is known to stain recycling synaptic vesicles, we demonstrate that no donors and membrane permeant cgmp analogues cause vesicle release at the nmj. moreover, the no-induced release could be blocked by the specific inhibitor of the sgc. a destaining of synaptic terminals after no exposure in ca2+-free solution in the presence of cobalt chloride as a channel blocker suggested that no stimulates ca2+-independent vesicle release at the nmj. the combined immunocytochemical and exocytosis imaging experiments imply the involvement of cgmp and no in the regulation of vesicle release at the nmj of drosophila larvae. nitric oxide is generated by a ca2+/calmodulin‐stimulated nitric oxide synthase and activates soluble guanylyl cyclase. using nadph diaphorase (nadphd) staining as a marker for the enzyme nitric oxide synthase and an antiserum against cgmp, we investigated the cellular organization of nitric oxide donor and target cells in olfactory pathways of the brain of the locust (schistocerca gregaria). a small subset of neuronal and glial cells expressed cgmp immunoreactivity after incubation of tissue in a nitric oxide donor. nitric oxide‐induced increases in cgmp immunoreactivity were quantified in a tissue preparation of the antennal lobe and in primary mushroom body cell cultures. the mushroom body neuropil is a potential target of a transcellular nitric oxide/ cgmp messenger system since it is innervated by extrinsic nadphd‐positive neurons. the mushroom body‐intrinsic kenyon cells do not stain for nadphd but can be induced to express cgmp immunoreactivity. the colocalization of nadphd and cgmp immunoreactivity in a cluster of interneurons of the antennal lobe, the principal olfactory neuropil of the insect brain, suggests a role of the nitric oxide/cgmp system in olfactory sensory processing. colocalization of nadphd staining and cgmp immunoreactivity was also found in certain glial cells. the cellular organization of the nitric oxide/cgmp system in neurons and glia raises the possibility that nitric oxide acts not only as an intercellular but also as an intracellular messenger molecule in the insect brain.
particle filtering (pf) based object tracking algorithms have drawn great attention from lots of scholars. the core of pf is to predict the possible location of the target via the state transition model. one commonly adopted approach is resorting to prior motion cues under the smooth motion assumption, which performs well when the target moves with a relatively stable velocity. however, it would possibly fail if the target is undergoing abrupt motion. to address this problem, inspired by insect vision, we propose a simple yet effective visual tracking framework based on pf. utilizing the neuronal computational model of the insect vision, we estimate the motion of the target in a novel way so as to refine the position state of propagated particles using more accurate transition mode. furthermore, we design a novel sample optimization framework where local and global search strategies are jointly used. in addition, we propose a new method to monitor long duration severe occlusion and we could recover the target. experiments on publicly available benchmark video sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracking algorithm outperforms the state-of-the art methods in challenging scenarios, especially for tracking target which is undergoing abrupt motion or fast movement. recent years have seen greater interest in the use of discriminative classifiers in tracking systems, owing to their success in object detection. they are trained online with samples collected during tracking. unfortunately, the potentially large number of samples becomes a computational burden, which directly conflicts with real-time requirements. on the other hand, limiting the samples may sacrifice performance.    interestingly, we observed that, as we add more and more samples, the problem acquires circulant structure. using the well-established theory of circulant matrices, we provide a link to fourier analysis that opens up the possibility of extremely fast learning and detection with the fast fourier transform. this can be done in the dual space of kernel machines as fast as with linear classifiers. we derive closed-form solutions for training and detection with several types of kernels, including the popular gaussian and polynomial kernels. the resulting tracker achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art, can be implemented with only a few lines of code and runs at hundreds of frames-per-second. matlab code is provided in the paper (see algorithm 1).
provided stimuli are highly distinct, the detection of changes between two briefly separated arrays appears to be achieved by an all-or-none process where either the relevant information is in working memory or observers guess. this observation suggests that it is possible to estimate the average number of items an observer was able to retain across a series of trials, a potentially highly informative cognitive characteristic. for each version of the change detection paradigm, for this estimate to be accurate, it is important to specify how observers use the information available to them. for some instantiations of this task it is possible that observers use knowledge of the contents of working memory even when they are in a guessing state, rather than selecting between the response alternatives at random. here we test the suggestion that observers may be able to use their knowledge of the number of items in memory to guide guessing in two versions of the change detection task. the four experiments reported here suggest that participants are, in fact, able to use the parameters of the task to update their base expectation of a change occurring to arrive at more informed guessing. (194 words) here we examine a new task to assess working memory for visual arrays in which the participant must judge how many items changed from a studied array to a test array. as a clue to processing, on some trials in the first 2 experiments, participants carried out a metamemory judgment in which they were to decide how many items were in working memory. trial-to-trial fluctuations in these working memory storage judgments correlated with performance fluctuations within an individual, indicating a need to include trial-to-trial variation within capacity models (through either capacity fluctuation or some other attention parameter). mathematical modeling of the results achieved a good fit to a complex pattern of results, suggesting that working memory capacity limits can apply even to judgments that involve an entire array rather than just a single item that may have changed, thus providing the expected conscious access to at least some of the contents of working memory.
mitochondrial respiration is important for cell proliferation; however, the specific metabolic requirements fulfilled by respiration to support proliferation have not been defined. here, we show that a major role of respiration in proliferating cells is to provide electron acceptors for aspartate synthesis. this finding is consistent with the observation that cells lacking a functional respiratory chain are auxotrophic for pyruvate, which serves as an exogenous electron acceptor. further, the pyruvate requirement can be fulfilled with an alternative electron acceptor, alpha-ketobutyrate, which provides cells neither carbon nor atp. alpha-ketobutyrate restores proliferation when respiration is inhibited, suggesting that an alternative electron acceptor can substitute for respiration to support proliferation. we find that electron acceptors are limiting for producing aspartate, and supplying aspartate enables proliferation of respiration deficient cells in the absence of exogenous electron acceptors. together, these data argue a major function of respiration in proliferating cells is to support aspartate synthesis. reprogramming of cellular metabolism is an emerging hallmark of neoplastic transformation. however, it is not known how the expression of metabolic genes in tumors differs from that in normal tissues, or whether different tumor types exhibit similar metabolic changes. here we compare expression patterns of metabolic genes across 22 diverse types of human tumors. overall, the metabolic gene expression program in tumors is similar to that in the corresponding normal tissues. although expression changes of some metabolic pathways (e.g., upregulation of nucleotide biosynthesis and glycolysis) are frequently observed across tumors, expression changes of other pathways (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation) are very heterogeneous. our analysis also suggests that the expression changes of some metabolic genes (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase) may enhance or mimic the effects of recurrent mutations in tumors. on the level of individual biochemical reactions, many hundreds of metabolic isoenzymes show significant and tumor-specific expression changes. these isoenzymes are potential targets for anticancer therapy.
objective: the purposes of this study were to investigate self-reported social experience in 10-year-old children born with a cleft lip and/or palate and to gain a better understanding of variables implicated in psychosocial resilience. design: cross-sectional study of 10-year-old children from five consecutive birth cohorts, born from 1992 to 1997. participants: a total of 268 children treated by the oslo cleft team (norway) participated in the study. the children's cleft conditions included cleft lip and palate, cleft lip alveolus, cleft palate, and submucous cleft palate. outcome measures: psychosocial resilience was measured with the child experience questionnaire (ceq). other variables were obtained during a clinical interview with the child. cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial functioning was measured with the personality inventory for children (pic). satisfaction with appearance was assessed through the use of the satisfaction with appearance scales (swa). informants were both children and parents. results: cleft types differed significantly with respect to subtype and frequency of additional difficulties. psychosocial resilience was associated with adequate emotional functioning, high satisfaction with appearance, and a lower frequency of reported teasing. child characteristics such as visibility of cleft, gender, and additional diagnosis did not contribute to explain psychosocial resilience. conclusions: results reported here emphasise the importance of assessing the child's subjective report of satisfaction with appearance and psychosocial experience. the objective of this study was to determine whether variation in psychological adjustment to physically disfiguring conditions is related to organisation of the content of appearance-related information in the self-concept. a cross-sectional design was employed, using 70 participants with a range of appearance problems recruited from support groups and the nhs. a postal paper and pencil task was completed by participants which assessed the level of their adjustment using the derriford appearance scale, and measured the three self-concept variables – differential importance, compartmentalisation and complexity. regression analyses showed that poor adjustment to disfigurement is related to greater differential importance of appearance-related self-aspects, greater compartmentalisation of appearance-related information and greater self-concept complexity. no moderating effects were found between these independent variables. the results have implications for psychological treatment strategies, particularly cognitive behavioural therapeutic interventions.
the c-jun nh2-terminal kinase (jnk), also known as stress-activated protein kinase, is a mitogen-activated protein kinase that determines cell survival in response to environmental stress. activation of jnk involves redox-sensitive mechanisms and physiological stimuli such as shear stress, the dragging force generated by blood flow over the endothelium. laminar shear stress has antiatherogenic properties and controls structure and function of endothelial cells by mechanisms including production of nitric oxide (no) and superoxide ([formula: see text]). here we show that both no and [formula: see text] are required for activation of jnk by shear stress in endothelial cells. the present study also demonstrates that exposure of endothelial cells to shear stress increases tyrosine nitration, a marker of reactive nitrogen species formation. furthermore, inhibitors or scavengers of no, [formula: see text], or reactive nitrogen species prevented shear-dependent increase in tyrosine nitration and activation of jnk. peroxynitrite alone, added to cells as a bolus or generated over 60 min by 3-morpholinosydnonimine, also activates jnk. these results suggest that reactive nitrogen species, in this case most likely peroxynitrite, act as signaling molecules in the mechanoactivation of jnk. shear stress differentially regulates production of many vasoactive factors at the level of gene expression in endothelial cells that may be mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) and n-terminal jun kinase (jnk). here we show, using bovine aortic endothelial cells (baec), that shear stress differentially regulates erk and jnk by mechanisms involving gi2 and pertussis toxin (ptx)-insensitive g-protein-dependent pathways, respectively. shear activated erk with a rapid, biphasic time course (maximum by 5 min and basal by 30-min shear exposure) and force dependence (minimum and maximum at 1 and 10 dyn/cm2 shear stress, respectively). ptx treatment prevented shear-dependent activation of erk1/2, consistent with a gi-dependent mechanism. in contrast, jnk activity was maximally turned on by a threshold level of shear force (0.5 dyn/cm2 or higher) with a much slower and prolonged time course (requiring at least 30 min to 4 h) than that of erk. also, ptx had no effect on shear-dependent activation of jnk. to further define the shear-sensitive erk and jnk pathways, vectors expressing hemagglutinin epitope-tagged erk (ha-erk) or ha-jnk were co-transfected with other vectors by using adenovirus-polylysine in baec. expression of the mutant αi2(g203), antisense gαi2 and a dominant negative ras (n17ras) prevented shear-dependent activation of ha-erk, while that of αi2(g204) and antisense αi3 did not. expression of a gβ/γ scavenger, the carboxyl terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βark-ct), and n17ras inhibited shear-dependent activation of ha-jnk. treatment of baec with genistein prevented shear-dependent activation of erk and jnk, indicating the essential role of tyrosine kinase(s) in both erk and jnk pathways. these results provide evidence that 1) gi2-protein, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s) are upstream regulators of shear-dependent activation of erk and 2) that shear-dependent activation of jnk is regulated by mechanisms involving gβ/γ, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s).
in physiological conditions, different types of macrophages can be found within the central nervous system (cns), i.e., microglia, meningeal macrophages, and perivascular (blood-brain barrier) and choroid plexus (blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier) macrophages. microglia and tissue-resident macrophages, as well as blood-borne monocytes, have different origins, as the former derive from yolk sac erythromyeloid precursors and the latter from the fetal liver or bone marrow. accordingly, specific phenotypic patterns characterize each population. these cells function to maintain homeostasis and are directly involved in the development and resolution of neuroinflammatory processes. also, following inflammation, circulating monocytes can be recruited and enter the cns, therefore contributing to brain pathology. these cell populations have now been identified as key players in cns pathology, including autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, and degenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and alzheimer’s disease. here, we review the evidence on the involvement of cns macrophages in neuroinflammation and the advantages, pitfalls, and translational opportunities of pharmacological interventions targeting these heterogeneous cellular populations for the treatment of brain diseases. pu.1 is a member of the ets family of transcription factors and is expressed exclusively in cells of the hematopoietic lineage. mice homozygous for a disruption in the pu.1 dna binding domain are born alive but die of severe septicemia within 48 h. the analysis of these neonates revealed a lack of mature macrophages, neutrophils, b cells and t cells, although erythrocytes and megakaryocytes were present. the absence of lymphoid commitment and development in null mice was not absolute, since mice maintained on antibiotics began to develop normal appearing t cells 3–5 days after birth. in contrast, mature b cells remained undetectable in these older mice. within the myeloid lineage, despite a lack of macrophages in the older antibiotic‐treated animals, a few cells with the characteristics of neutrophils began to appear by day 3. while the pu.1 protein appears not to be essential for myeloid and lymphoid lineage commitment, it is absolutely required for the normal differentiation of b cells and macrophages.
significance development of donor-specific antibodies (dsa) after kidney transplantation is associated with reduced allograft survival. a few strategies have been tested in controlled clinical trials for the treatment of antibody-mediated rejection (amr), and no therapies are approved by regulatory authorities. thus development of antihumoral therapies that provide prompt elimination of dsa and improve allograft survival is an important goal.   recent advances proteasome inhibitor (pi)-based regimens provide a promising new approach for treating amr. to date, experiences have been limited to off-label bortezomib use in amr. key findings with pi-based therapy are that they provide effective primary and rescue therapy for amr by prompt reduction in immunodominant dsa and improvements in histologic and renal function. early and late amr differ immunologically and in response to pi therapy. bortezomib-related toxicities in renal transplant recipients are similar to those observed in the multiple myeloma population.   critical issues although preliminary evidence with pi therapy for amr is encouraging, the evidence is limited. larger, prospective, randomized controlled trials with long-term follow up are needed. advancement in endpoints of clinical trial designs and rigorous clinical trials with more standardized adjunct therapies are also required to explore the risks and benefits of amr treatment modalities.   future directions in the next few years, new pis are likely to be introduced and new approaches would be developed for achieving synergy with pis. the ultimate goal will be to develop a regimen that delivers reliable, rapid, complete, and durable elimination of dsa with an acceptable safety profile. plasma cells provide humoral immunity. they have traditionally been viewed mainly as short-lived end-stage products of b-cell differentiation that deserve little interest. this view is changing, however, because we now know that plasma cells can survive for long periods in the appropriate survival niches and that they are an independent cellular component of immunological memory. studies of the biology of plasma cells reveal a mechanism of intriguing simplicity and elegance that focuses memory provided by plasma cells on recently encountered pathogens while minimizing the 'fading' of memory for pathogens encountered in the distant past. this mechanism is based on competition for survival niches between newly generated plasmablasts and older plasma cells.
contextual policy search allows adapting robotic movement primitives to different situations. for instance, a locomotion primitive might be adapted to different terrain inclinations or desired walking speeds. such an adaptation is often achievable by modifying a small number of hyperparameters. however, learning, when performed on real robotic systems, is typically restricted to a small number of trials. bayesian optimization has recently been proposed as a sample-efficient means for contextual policy search that is well suited under these conditions. in this work, we extend entropy search, a variant of bayesian optimization, such that it can be used for active contextual policy search where the agent selects those tasks during training in which it expects to learn the most. empirical results in simulation suggest that this allows learning successful behavior with less trials. contextual policy search is a reinforcement learning approach for multi-task learning in the context of robot control learning. it can be used to learn versatilely applicable skills that generalize over a range of tasks specified by a context vector. in this work, we combine contextual policy search with ideas from active learning for selecting the task in which the next trial will be performed. moreover, we use active training set selection for reducing detrimental effects of exploration in the sampling policy. a core challenge in this approach is that the distribution of the obtained rewards may not be directly comparable between different tasks. we propose the novel approach pubsve for estimating a reward baseline and investigate empirically on benchmark problems and simulated robotic tasks to which extent this method can remedy the issue of non-comparable reward.
the multiple-access relay channel (marc) and its gaussian version are important models in cellular, ad hoc communication systems, and sensor networks and also, this channel is a comprehensive model which consist of two important channels: relay channel (rc) and multiple access channel (mac). in this paper, we study and analyse the two-user state-dependent discrete and memoryless marc in which the independent states of channel are known non-causally only at the encoders. an achievable rate region by using binning and decode-and-forward (df) schemes and an outer bound for this model are obtained. we also by using our results obtain an inner bound for two-user gaussian marc with identical non-causal side information. our model includes discrete and continuous (gaussian) multiple access channel rate region and relay channel rate with non-causal side information. finally, we evaluate our bounds for gaussian marc numerically and illustrate the effect of interference power on bounds. we extend shannon's result on the capacity of channels with state information to multiple user channels. more specifically, we characterize the capacity (region) of degraded broadcast channels and physically degraded relay channels where the channel state information is causally available at the transmitters. we also obtain inner and outer bounds on the capacity region for multiple access channels with causal state information at the transmitters
backgroundmonoclonal gammopathies encompass a wide range of diseases characterized by the monoclonal expansion of a b-cell clone. despite emerging therapeutic strategies, chances of survival of patients who are affected are still scarce, which implies that new tools are necessary not only for the diagnosis but also for the follow-up of patients affected by such diseases. in this context, the use of free light chains (flcs) has been incorporated into many guidelines.likewise, tumor microenvironment is consistently gaining importance as role player in tumor pathogenesis. specifically, syndecan-1 (cd138), a heparan-sulfate proteoglycan is attracting interests as it is highly expressed and shed by myeloma plasma-cells.the aim of our study was to analyze cd138 levels in the serum of patients affected by multiple myeloma or light chain only disease, and to compare the values obtained with free light chain (flc) kappa, lambda and flc ratio in both groups of patients.methods84 patients affected by multiple myeloma and light chain myeloma were recruited for this study. serum cd138 was assessed by elisa (diaclone research, france) and flc values were quantified by nephelometry (freelite tm human kappa and lambda free kits, the binding site, uk). data was analyzed by graphpad prism software and statgraph.resultswe observed higher cd138 mean values in myeloma patients compared to the light chain only myeloma group. a positive linear regression of cd138 and flc was observed in the light chain only cohort as opposed to myeloma patients which show an inverse trend.conclusionsthe study highlighted an existing relationship between flcs and cd138 and wishes to seek also a correlation in order to rapidly and efficiently perform diagnosis and different diagnostic schemes. significance exosome-mediated intercellular transfer of proteins and nucleic acids has attracted considerable attention as exosomes may promote the development of cancer and other pathological conditions; however, the mechanism of exosome uptake by target cells and how this may be inhibited remain as important questions. we provide evidence that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (hspgs) function as receptors of cancer cell-derived exosomes. importantly, our data indicate that the hspg-dependent uptake route is highly relevant for the biological activity of exosomes, and thus a potential target for inhibition of exosome-mediated tumor development. given that several viruses have previously been shown to enter cells through hspgs, our data implicate hspg as a convergence point during cellular uptake of endogenous vesicles and virus particles. extracellular vesicle (ev)-mediated intercellular transfer of signaling proteins and nucleic acids has recently been implicated in the development of cancer and other pathological conditions; however, the mechanism of ev uptake and how this may be targeted remain as important questions. here, we provide evidence that heparan sulfate (hs) proteoglycans (pgs; hspgs) function as internalizing receptors of cancer cell-derived evs with exosome-like characteristics. internalized exosomes colocalized with cell-surface hspgs of the syndecan and glypican type, and exosome uptake was specifically inhibited by free hs chains, whereas closely related chondroitin sulfate had no effect. by using several cell mutants, we provide genetic evidence of a receptor function of hspg in exosome uptake, which was dependent on intact hs, specifically on the 2-o and n-sulfation groups. further, enzymatic depletion of cell-surface hspg or pharmacological inhibition of endogenous pg biosynthesis by xyloside significantly attenuated exosome uptake. we provide biochemical evidence that hspgs are sorted to and associate with exosomes; however, exosome-associated hspgs appear to have no direct role in exosome internalization. on a functional level, exosome-induced erk1/2 signaling activation was attenuated in pg-deficient mutant cells as well as in wt cells treated with xyloside. importantly, exosome-mediated stimulation of cancer cell migration was significantly reduced in pg-deficient mutant cells, or by treatment of wt cells with heparin or xyloside. we conclude that cancer cell-derived exosomes use hspgs for their internalization and functional activity, which significantly extends the emerging role of hspgs as key receptors of macromolecular cargo.
zearalenone (zea) is a mycoestrogen frequently found in food and animal feed materials all over the world. despite its hydrophobic character, zea is also found in surface and ground waters which suggests an environmental risk for aquatic animals. knowledge concerning mycotoxin-related mechanisms of toxicity is still incomplete, e.g. little is known about the influence of zea exposure on fish. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of zea on selected biochemical parameters in juvenile rainbow trout after 24, 72, and 168 h of intraperitoneal exposure (10 mg/kg of body weight). the analysis showed a slight tendency towards prolonged blood clotting time and significant iron deficiency in the liver and ovary of exposed animals. however, no differences in aminotransferase (alaat, aspat) activity or glucose levels in fish plasma was observed. the results of this study suggest that although trout exposed to zea did not exhibit any distinct symptoms of liver damage, the mycotoxin tested was able interfere with blood coagulation and iron-storage processes. bisphenol a (bpa), an estrogenic environmental contaminant is also known for oxidative stress-inducing effect. malnutrition is recognized as a confounding factor in oxidative stress. however, little is known about effect of malnutrition on oxidative stress induced by bpa or other endocrine disrupting chemicals (edcs). we studied effect of malnutrition (iron deficiency) in rats chronically exposed to low levels of bpa taking into consideration the oxidative stress and antioxidant status in liver, kidney and gonads. iron deficiency significantly elevated level of lipid peroxidation in bpa-exposed rats. similarly, decrease in reduced glutathione level was more significant in rats maintained on iron deficient diet compared to those maintained on normal diet. iron deficiency also significantly modulated activities of vital antioxidant enzymes in all the tissues. female rats showed more vulnerability than males to iron-deficiency modulated effects of bpa on the above parameters. this study demonstrated that malnutrition, especially iron deficiency, might act as a confounding factor in edc-induced oxidative stress. however, more studies may be needed to confirm effect of nutritional factors on estrogenic activity of bpa or other edcs.
hox genes are important regulators of limb pattern in vertebrate development. misexpression of hox genes in chicks using retroviral vectors provides an opportunity to analyze gain-of-function phenotypes and to assess their modes of action. here we report the misexpression phenotype for hoxd-13 and compare it to the misexpression phenotype of hoxd-11. hoxd-13 misexpression in the hindlimb results in a shortening of the long bones, including the femur, the tibia, the fibula and the tarsometatarsals. mutations in an alanine repeat region in the n-terminus of hoxd-13 have recently been implicated in human synpolydactyly (muragaki, y., mundlos, s., upton, j. and olsen, b. r. (1996) science 272, 548-551). n-terminal truncations of hoxd-13 which lack this repeat were constructed and were found to produce a similar, although slightly milder, misexpression phenotype than the full-length hoxd-13. the stage of bone development regulated by hox genes has not previously been examined. the changes in bone lengths caused by hoxd-13 misexpression are late phenotypes that first become apparent during the growth phase of the bones. analysis of tritiated thymidine uptake by the tibia and fibula demonstrates that hox genes can pattern the limb skeleton by regulating the rates of cell division in the proliferative zone of growing cartilage. hoxd-11, in contrast to hoxd-13, acts both at the initial cartilage condensation phase in the foot and during the later growth phase in the lower leg. ectopic hoxd-13 appears to act in a dominant negative manner in regions where it is not normally expressed. we propose a model in which all hox genes are growth promoters, regulating the expression of the same target genes, with some hox genes being more effective promoters of growth than other hox genes. according to this model, the overall rate of growth in a given region is the result of the combined action of all of the hox genes expressed in that region competing for the same target genes. replication-competent avian retroviruses, capable of transducing and expressing up to 2 kb of nonviral sequences, are now available to effect widespread gene transfer in chicken (chick) embryos (s. h. hughes, j. j. greenhouse, c. j. petropoulos, and p. sutrave, j. virol. 61:3004-3012, 1987). we have constructed novel avian retroviral vectors that encode human placental alkaline phosphatase as a marker whose expression can be histochemically monitored. these vectors have been tested for expression by introducing them into the embryonic chick nervous system. they have revealed that the expression of retrovirally transduced genes can be spatially and temporally limited without the need for tissue-specific promoters. by varying the site and time of infection, targeted gene transfer can be confined to selected populations of neural cells over the course of several days, a time window that is sufficient for many key developmental processes. the capability of differentially infecting specific target populations may avoid confounding variables such as detrimental effects of a transduced gene on processes unrelated to the cells or tissue of interest. these vectors and methods thus should be useful in studies of the effect of transduced genes on the development of various organs and tissues during avian embryogenesis. in addition, the vectors will facilitate studies aimed at an understanding of viral infection and expression patterns.
background hormonally active environmental agents have recently been associated with the development of endometriosis.   methods we undertook a study to assess the relationship between endometriosis, an estrogen-dependent gynaecological disease, and 62 individual polychlorinated biphenyl (pcbs) congeners. we enrolled 84 eligible women aged 18-40 years undergoing laparoscopy for study, which included an interview and blood specimen (n=79; 94%). thirty-two women had visually confirmed endometriosis at laparoscopy while 52 did not. blood specimens were run in batches of 14 including four quality control samples for toxicological analysis. each pcb congener was adjusted for recovery; batch-specific reagent blanks were subtracted. all pcb concentrations were log transformed and expressed in ng/g serum first as a sum and then as tertiles by purported estrogenic or anti-estrogenic activity of pcb congeners.   results using unconditional logistic regression analysis, a significantly elevated odds ratio (or) was observed for women in the third tertile of anti-estrogenic pcbs [or 3.77; 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.12-12.68]. risk remained elevated after controlling for gravidity, current cigarette smoking and serum lipids (or 3.30; 95% ci 0.87-12.46).   conclusions these data suggest that anti-estrogenic pcbs may be associated with the development of endometriosis. 17 beta-estradiol (e2) induces cathepsin d mrna levels and intracellular levels of immunoreactive protein in mcf-7 human breast cancer cells. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd) alone does not affect cathepsin d gene expression in this cell line; however, in cells cotreated with tcdd and e2, tcdd inhibited e2-induced cathepsin d mrna levels, the rate of gene transcription, and levels of immunoreactive protein. the inhibitory responses were observed within 30 to 120 min after the cells were treated with tcdd. tcdd also inhibited e2-induced secreted alkaline phosphatase activity in aryl hydrocarbon (ah)-responsive mcf-7 and wild-type mouse hepa 1c1c7 cells cotransfected with the human estrogen receptor (her) and the pbc12/s1/pac plasmid, which contains the 5' promoter region (-296/+57) of the cathepsin d gene and an alkaline phosphatase reporter gene. the e2-responsive er/sp1 sequence (-199 to -165) in the cathepsin d 5' region contains an imperfect gtgcgtg (-175/-181) xenobiotic responsive element (xre); the role of this sequence in ah responsiveness was investigated in gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays and with plasmid constructs containing a wild-type er/sp1 oligonucleotide or a mutant er/sp1-"xre" oligonucleotide containing two c-->a mutations in the xre sequence (antisense strand). in plasmid constructs which contained a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and the wild-type er/sp1 promoter sequence, e2-induced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity and mrna levels were inhibited by tcdd whereas no inhibition was observed with the mutant er/sp1-"xre" plasmids. electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the nuclear or transformed cytosolic ah receptor complex blocked formation of the er-sp1 complex with the wild-type but not the er/sp1 mutant oligonucleotide. moreover, incubation of the wild-type bromodeoxyuridine-substituted er/sp1 oligonucleotide with the nuclear ah receptor complex gave a specifically bound cross-linked 200-kda band. these data demonstrate that ah receptor-mediated inhibition of e2-induced cathepsin d gene expression is due to disruption of the er-sp1 complex by targeted interaction with an overlapping xre.
abstract the most frequent sites of distant metastasis of colorectal cancer (crc) are primarily liver and lung, followed by brain and bone metastases. infrequently, metastases are found in the adrenal glands. they usually have a metachronous and homolateral character. we present a case of contralateral synchronic adrenal metastasis of crc and its surgical resolution. integrated fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (pet)-computed tomography (ct) for adrenal gland imaging in cancer patients allows early detection and accurate localization of adrenal lesions and differentiation of metastatic nodules from benign lesions, thereby facilitating treatment planning. however, false-positive findings are encountered at integrated pet-ct in approximately 5% of adrenal lesions identified as positive at pet, including adrenal adenomas, adrenal endothelial cysts, and inflammatory and infectious lesions. moreover, false-negative findings may be seen in adrenal metastatic lesions with hemorrhage or necrosis, small-sized (<10-mm) metastatic nodules, and metastases from pulmonary bronchioloalveolar carcinoma or carcinoid tumors. an awareness of the potential pitfalls of integrated pet-ct enhances the diagnostic efficacy of this modality by allowing differentiation of metastatic adrenal lesions from other abnormalities.
perk signaling is required for cancer invasion and there is interest in targeting this pathway for therapy. unfortunately, chemical inhibitors of perk’s kinase activity cause on-target side effects that have precluded their further development. one strategy for resolving this difficulty would be to target downstream components of the pathway that specifically mediate perk’s pro-invasive and metastatic functions. here we identify the transcription factor creb3l1 as an essential mediator of perk’s pro-metastatic functions in breast cancer. creb3l1 acts downstream of perk, specifically in the mesenchymal subtype of triple-negative tumors, and its inhibition by genetic or pharmacological methods suppresses cancer cell invasion and metastasis. in patients with this tumor subtype, creb3l1 expression is predictive of distant metastasis. these findings establish creb3l1 as a key downstream mediator of perk-driven metastasis and a druggable target for breast cancer therapy.perk stress signaling is an important driver of cancer invasion and metastasis, but chemical inhibitors of perk cause side effects. here, the authors find that creb3l1 is required for perk's pro-metastatic function in breast cancer, and its inhibition suppresses cancer invasion and metastasis. oasis is a transcription factor similar to atf6 that is activated by endoplasmic reticulum stress. in this study we investigated the expression of oasis in human glioma cell lines and the effect of oasis knock-down on the er stress response and cell migration. oasis mrna was detected in three distinct glioma cell lines (u373, a172 and u87) and expression levels were increased upon treatment with er stress-inducing compounds in the u373 and u87 lines. oasis protein, which is glycosylated on asn-513, was detected in the u373 and u87 glioma lines at low levels in control cells and protein expression was induced by er stress. knock-down of oasis in human glioma cell lines resulted in an attenuated unfolded protein response to er stress (reduced grp78/bip and grp94 induction) and decreased expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan extracellular matrix proteins, but induction of the collagen gene col1a1 was unaffected. cells in which oasis was knocked-down exhibited altered cell morphology and reduced cell migration. these results suggest that oasis is important for the er stress response and maintenance of some extracellular matrix proteins in human glioma cells.
interpersonal victimization is widely acknowledged to be a significant stressor and psychologically damaging factor for both children and adolescents. despite the large number of studies that report a clear association between specific kinds of victimization and psychiatric disorders, little research to date has accounted for the full spectrum of victimization to which adolescents can be exposed. the current thesis aims to analyse the mental health aftermath of victimization, taking into account the wide range of victimizations to which adolescents are exposed, and highlighting the higher vulnerability of those who can be considered “poly-victims”. it also aims to study the role that variables like self-esteem may play in buffering the negative effects of victimization. this thesis is based on four studies (soler, paretilla, kirchner, & forns, 2012; soler, kirchner, paretilla & forns, 2013; soler, segura, kirchner, & forns, 2013; soler, forns, kirchner, & segura, 2014). overall, the results highlight the high burden of victimization to which spanish adolescents are exposed, and show that youth rarely suffer single victimizing events but are more likely to endure rather multiple victimization experiences. similarly, very few adolescents reported victimization in only one area (e.g., only sexual victimization); rather, they tend to report a combination of different areas. moreover, it was found that the impact of individual areas of victimization on mental health tends to decrease and even become irrelevant when the combination of different areas is taken into account, showing that it is probably the combination of victimization areas, and not single areas, that is truly important for adolescents’ mental health. overall, girls at adolescent ages showed higher psychological distress than boys. moreover, although in general boys and girls reported equivalent amounts of victimization (i.e., total kinds of victimization), girls reported twice as much child maltreatment and sexual victimization as boys. boys and girls in the poly-victim condition were the ones that reported the most psychopathological symptoms (e.g., ptss, suicidal behaviours) and lower self-esteem, highlighting the cumulative effect of increasing stressors (cloitre et al., 2009). a gender-specific psychopathologic response linked to the cumulative pattern of interpersonal victimization was found, with boys showing increased distress in the poly-victim condition and girls showing increased distress even in mild levels of victimization. this signals that victimization may play an important role in producing the gender differences in mental health that are found in the general population, and highlights females’ greater vulnerability to victimization. experiencing multiple kinds of victimization or poly-victimization was found to affect adolescents’ self-evaluation as worthy social beings (i.e., self-liking), but it did not seem to make them question their self-efficacy (i.e., self-competence). also, self-liking was found to be a partial mediator of the relationship between victimization and certain mental health variables (e.g., internalizing symptoms) in both boys and girls, whereas self-competence was found to be a mediator of this relationship only in girls. these findings may be of help to clinicians and health practitioners since they suggest that working on adolescents’ sense of personal value (self-liking) and girls’ sense of ability to meet personal goals (self-competence) may help them to build up resilience in the face of adversity. youths who have been maltreated often experience symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd), and this special population has received increased attention from researchers. pathways toward maladaptive effects of maltreatment and ptsd are remarkably similar and reflect specific biological diatheses and psychological vulnerabilities that produce wide-ranging self-regulation deficits. developmental models of effects of maltreatment and of ptsd are thus increasingly intertwined and have begun to inform specialized assessment and treatment strategies for this population. this review covers key aspects of posttraumatic stress disorder in maltreated youth, including epidemiology, symptomatology, outcome, and risk factors as well as assessment and treatment strategies and challenges for these youths.
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is a prevalent and complex disease that confers a high risk of severe liver disorders. despite such public and clinical health importance, very few effective therapies are currently available for nafld. we report a protective function and the underlying mechanism of dual‐specificity phosphatase 14 (dusp14) in nafld and related metabolic disorders. insulin resistance, hepatic lipid accumulation, and concomitant inflammatory responses, key pathological processes involved in nafld development, were significantly ameliorated by hepatocyte‐specific dusp14 overexpression (dusp14‐htg) in high‐fat diet (hfd)‐induced or genetically obese mouse models. by contrast, specific dusp14 deficiency in hepatocytes (dusp14‐hko) aggravated these pathological alterations. we provided mechanistic evidence that dusp14 directly binds to and dephosphorylates transforming growth factor β–activated kinase 1 (tak1), resulting in the reduced activation of tak1 and its downstream signaling molecules c‐jun n‐terminal kinase 1 (jnk), p38, and nuclear factor kappa b nf‐κb. this effect was further evidenced by the finding that inhibiting tak1 activity effectively attenuated the deterioration of glucolipid metabolic phenotype in dusp14‐hko mice challenged by hfd administration. furthermore, we identified that both the binding domain and the phosphatase activity of dusp14 are required for its protective role against hepatic steatosis, because interruption of the dusp14‐tak1 interaction abolished the mitigative effects of dusp14. conclusion: hepatocyte dusp14 is required for maintaining hepatic metabolic homeostasis and for suppressing inflammation, a novel function that relies on constraining tak1 hyperactivation. (hepatology 2018;67:1320‐1338). dusps (dual-specificity phosphatases) are a heterogeneous group of protein phosphatases that can dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues within the one substrate. dusps have been implicated as major modulators of critical signalling pathways that are dysregulated in various diseases. dusps can be divided into six subgroups on the basis of sequence similarity that include slingshots, prls (phosphatases of regenerating liver), cdc14 phosphatases (cdc is cell division cycle), ptens (phosphatase and tensin homologues deleted on chromosome 10), myotubularins, mkps (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases) and atypical dusps. of these subgroups, a great deal of research has focused on the characterization of the mkps. as their name suggests, mkps dephosphorylate mapk (mitogen-activated protein kinase) proteins erk (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), jnk (c-jun n-terminal kinase) and p38 with specificity distinct from that of individual mkp proteins. atypical dusps are mostly of low-molecular-mass and lack the n-terminal ch2 (cdc25 homology 2) domain common to mkps. the discovery of most atypical dusps has occurred in the last 6 years, which has initiated a large amount of interest in their role and regulation. in the past, atypical dusps have generally been grouped together with the mkps and characterized for their role in mapk signalling cascades. indeed, some have been shown to dephosphorylate mapks. the current literature hints at the potential of the atypical dusps as important signalling regulators, but is crowded with conflicting reports. the present review provides an overview of the dusp family before focusing on atypical dusps, emerging as a group of proteins with vastly diverse substrate specificity and function.
mental capital and wellbeing. the views expressed do not represent the policy of any government or organisation. 2 summary the onset of substance use coincides with a critical maturation period of the neural substrates that are affected by alcohol and other drugs of abuse. behaviourally, adolescents exhibit distinct patterns of risk-taking. moreover, neuroimaging studies have shown that these individuals, when compared to adults, engage different neural systems when processing rewards and punishments. therefore, a better understanding of the behavioural and neural systems processes during adolescence is very important for the design of effective intervention programming. this review highlights the characteristics of alcohol and other drug use disorders during adolescence and shows examples of behavioural and neural substrate response patterns revealing differential processing of cue-related stimuli and risk-taking behaviour. recent studies are reviewed, showing that heavy drinking during adolescence is associated with reduced hippocampal volume, disturbed white matter integrity, and abnormal brain response during cognitive tasks, while heavy cannabis use during adolescence is linked to abnormal brain response during cognitive tasks as well as poorer learning and attention performance. we propose that certain individuals may be at a higher risk for substance problems because of a mixture of pre-existing conditions and increased vulnerability to the effects of alcohol or other drugs of abuse. in particular, youth deploying more processing resources to reward-related stimuli and not taking into account risk-related outcomes may be vulnerable to adverse behavioural consequences. support for this proposition would provide a rational basis for the development of new intervention programmes. 1. adolescence, drug use and the brain individuals often initiate the use of substances during a time when the brain is undergoing a critical maturation period. moreover, these substances can have profound effects on neural substrates that are important for cognition and emotion. for example, adolescents exhibit distinct patterns of risk-taking behaviour, weighing rewards and potential punishments differently than adults, and neuroimaging studies have shown that these individuals, compared to adults, engage different neural systems when processing rewards and punishments. therefore, to develop better intervention programmes, we need a thorough understanding of how brains of adolescents process these and other behaviours. this review highlights the characteristics of alcohol and other drug use disorders during adolescence and shows examples of behavioural and neural substrate response patterns revealing differential processing of cue-related stimuli and risk-taking behaviour. we propose that certain individuals may be at a higher risk for substance problems … background the present study examined associations between alcohol involvement in early to middle adolescence and neuropsychological (np) functioning.   methods alcohol-dependent adolescents (n = 33) with over 100 lifetime alcohol episodes and without dependence on other substances were recruited from alcohol/drug abuse treatment facilities. comparison (n = 24) adolescents had no histories of alcohol or drug problems and were matched to alcohol-dependent participants on age (15 to 16 years), gender, socioeconomic status, education, and family history of alcohol dependence. np tests and psychosocial measures were administered to alcohol-dependent participants following 3 weeks of detoxification.   results alcohol-dependent and comparison adolescents demonstrated significant differences on several np scores. protracted alcohol use was associated with poorer performance on verbal and nonverbal retention in the context of intact learning and recognition discriminability. recent alcohol withdrawal among adolescents was associated with poor visuospatial functioning, whereas lifetime alcohol withdrawal was associated with poorer retrieval of verbal and nonverbal information.   conclusions deficits in retrieval of verbal and nonverbal information and in visuospatial functioning were evident in youths with histories of heavy drinking during early and middle adolescence.
a literacy-related activity that occurs in children's homes-talk about letters in everyday conversations-was examined using data from 50 children who were visited every 4 months between 14 and 50 months. parents talked about some letters, including those that are common in english words and the first letter of their children's names, especially often. parents' focus on the child's initial was especially strong in families of higher socioeconomic status, and the extent to which parents talked about the child's initial during the later sessions of the study was related to the children's kindergarten reading skill. conversations that included the child's initial were longer than those that did not, and parents presented a variety of information about this letter. two studies were performed to determine whether children's experiences with their own names boost their knowledge about the components of the name, the letters. the children in study one showed a significant superiority for the initial letter of their own first name in tests of letter-name, but not letter-sound, knowledge. this pattern was found for australian first graders (mean age 5 years, 5 months), u.s. kindergartners (mean age 5 years, 8 months), and u.s. preschoolers (mean age 4 years, 10 months). study two, with u.s. preschoolers (mean age 4 years, 11 months), again revealed an advantage for the initial letter of a child's first name in knowledge of letter names but not knowledge of letter sounds. moreover, the children were better at printing the initial letter of their own first name than other letters. the results show that different factors are involved in the learning of letter names and letter sounds. they further suggest that children use letter-based strategies with their own names at a time when they are often considered to be "logographic" readers.
probiotics are becoming increasingly popular due to their perceived effects on health, despite a lack of mechanistic information on how they impart these benefits. infant formula and complementary foods are common targets for supplementation with probiotics. however, different probiotic strains have different properties, and there is a lack of data on long-term health effects on the consumer. given the increasing interest in supplementation with probiotics and the fact that the gastrointestinal tracts of infants are still immature, we sought to determine whether consumption of infant formula containing the probiotic bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis hn019 for 3 months starting at birth would impact gut microbial colonization, as well as infant immunity and metabolism, when compared with consumption of formula alone. abstract to investigate the impact of probiotic supplementation of infant formula on immune parameters, intestinal microbiota, and metabolism, five individually housed infant rhesus monkeys exclusively fed standard infant formula supplemented with probiotics (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis hn019) from birth until 3 months of age were compared with five standard formula-fed and five breast-fed monkeys. anthropometric measurements, serum insulin, immune parameters, fecal microbiota, and metabolic profiles of serum, urine, and feces were evaluated. consumption of b. lactis-supplemented formula reduced microbial diversity, restructured the fecal microbial community, and altered the fecal metabolome at the last two time points, in addition to increasing short-chain fatty acids in serum and urine. circulating ccl22 was lower and threonine, branched-chain amino acids, urea, and allantoin, as well as dimethylglycine in serum and urine, were increased in the group supplemented with b. lactis compared with the standard formula-fed group. these results support a role of probiotics as effectors of gut microbial activity regulating amino acid utilization and nitrogen cycling. future risk-benefit analyses are still needed to consolidate the existing knowledge on the long-term consequences of probiotic administration during infancy. importance probiotics are becoming increasingly popular due to their perceived effects on health, despite a lack of mechanistic information on how they impart these benefits. infant formula and complementary foods are common targets for supplementation with probiotics. however, different probiotic strains have different properties, and there is a lack of data on long-term health effects on the consumer. given the increasing interest in supplementation with probiotics and the fact that the gastrointestinal tracts of infants are still immature, we sought to determine whether consumption of infant formula containing the probiotic bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis hn019 for 3 months starting at birth would impact gut microbial colonization, as well as infant immunity and metabolism, when compared with consumption of formula alone. exposure to a strong t-helper 2 (th2)-like environment during fetal development may promote allergy development. increased cord blood (cb) levels of the th2-associated chemokine ccl22 were associated with allergy development during the first 2 y of life. the aim of the present study was to determine whether cb th1- and th2-associated chemokine levels are associated with allergy development during the first 6 y of life, allowing assessment of respiratory allergic symptoms usually developing in this period. the cb levels of cytokines, chemokines, and total ige were determined in 56 children of 20 women with allergic symptoms and 36 women without allergic symptoms. total ige and allergen-specific ige antibody levels were quantified at 6, 12, 24 mo, and 6 y of age. increased cb ccl22 levels were associated with development of allergic sensitization and asthma and increased ccl17 levels with development of allergic symptoms, including asthma. sensitized children with allergic symptoms showed higher cb ccl17 and ccl22 levels and higher ratios between these th2-associated chemokines and the th1-associated chemokine cxcl10 than nonsensitized children without allergic symptoms. a pronounced th2 deviation at birth, reflected by increased cb ccl17 and ccl22 levels, and increased ccl22/cxcl10 and ccl17/cxcl10 ratios might promote allergy development later in life.
humans and other animals use the global geometry of the surrounding environment in order to orient and determine which direction they are facing. accordingly, the impact of environment geometry on spatial behavior is reflected in the paths of progression in the environment. when the perception of the global geometry is limited, such as in large or dark environments, the global geometry of the environment has to be constructed gradually as the accumulated geometry of locales. in the present study, we progressively altered the form of a dark square test arena by means of local alterations to its corners and walls, in order to differentiate the impact of the global arena geometry from that of the local arena geometry sectors on spatial behavior in rats. we found that as long as the local alterations did not distort the global square geometry of the dark environment, the rats’ behavior did not significantly change. in contrast, distortion of the square shape of the arena resulted in significant changes in the spatial distribution of the rats’ activity. accordingly, we suggest that the perceived global geometry affects spatial behavior, overriding the impact of the local geometry. exploration in a dark open field undergoes three progressive changes: (i) an initial phase of spending equal amounts of time in various zones of the arena changes to staying in the corners, and ultimately spending most of the time in one corner; (ii) travel paths are first circular and scattered all over the arena, but gradually become anchored to one corner at which they start and end; (iii) traveled distance gradually decreases to that of the initial level seen in a lit open field. altogether, rodents shift from a 'looping' exploration mechanism with feeble coupling with the environment, to 'home base' exploration which is firmly anchored to the environment. this shift also involves switching from momentary and sporadic to repeated returns to a specific, presumably familiar place, to which the animal navigates back from various other places. we suggest that this switching illustrates navigation first by directional and then by positional environmental cues, as hypothesized in the 'parallel map theory'. we also suggest that the transition from looping to home base behavior is part of a hierarchal construction of space representation via three modes of spatial information processing: (i) piloting--sequential processing, based on moving from one landmark to the next; (ii) orienting--parallel processing, based on moving from one point to the next, with the same starting and ending point; (iii) navigating--continuous processing, based on continuously updating the position in relation to several locations in the environment (map navigation).
abstract herpesviruses utilize multiple mechanisms to redirect host proteins for use in viral processes and to avoid recognition and repression by the host. to investigate dynamic interactions between herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) dna and viral and host proteins throughout infection, we developed an approach to identify proteins that associate with the infecting viral genome from nuclear entry through packaging. to accomplish this, virus stocks were prepared in the presence of ethynyl-modified nucleotides to enable covalent tagging of viral genomes after infection for analysis of viral genome-protein interactions by imaging or affinity purification. affinity purification was combined with stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (silac) mass spectrometry to enable the distinction between proteins that were brought into the cell by the virus or expressed within the infected cell before or during infection. we found that input viral dna progressed within 6 h through four temporal stages where the genomes sequentially (i) interacted with intrinsic antiviral and dna damage response proteins, (ii) underwent a robust transcriptional switch mediated largely by icp4, (iii) engaged in replication, repair, and continued transcription, and then (iv) transitioned to a more transcriptionally inert state engaging de novo-synthesized viral structural components while maintaining interactions with replication proteins. using a combination of genetic, imaging, and proteomic approaches, we provide a new and temporally compressed view of the hsv-1 life cycle based on input genome-proteome dynamics. importance herpesviruses are highly prevalent and ubiquitous human pathogens. studies of herpesviruses and other viruses have previously been limited by the ability to directly study events that occur on the viral dna throughout infection. we present a new powerful approach, which allows for the temporal investigation of viral genome-protein interactions at all phases of infection. this work has integrated many results from previous studies with the discovery of novel factors potentially involved in viral infection that may represent new antiviral targets. in addition, the study provides a new view of the hsv-1 life cycle based on genome-proteome dynamics. importance herpesviruses are highly prevalent and ubiquitous human pathogens. studies of herpesviruses and other viruses have previously been limited by the ability to directly study events that occur on the viral dna throughout infection. we present a new powerful approach, which allows for the temporal investigation of viral genome-protein interactions at all phases of infection. this work has integrated many results from previous studies with the discovery of novel factors potentially involved in viral infection that may represent new antiviral targets. in addition, the study provides a new view of the hsv-1 life cycle based on genome-proteome dynamics. herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) infects over half the human population. much of the infectious cycle occurs in the nucleus of cells where the virus has evolved mechanisms to manipulate host processes for the production of virus. the genome of hsv-1 is coordinately expressed, maintained, and replicated such that progeny virions are produced within 4–6 hours post infection. in this study, we selectively purify hsv-1 replication forks and associated proteins from virus-infected cells and identify select viral and cellular replication, repair, and transcription factors that associate with viral replication forks. pulse chase analyses and imaging studies reveal temporal and spatial dynamics between viral replication forks and associated proteins and demonstrate that several dna repair complexes and key transcription factors are recruited to or near replication forks. consistent with these observations we show that the initiation of viral dna replication is sufficient to license late gene transcription. these data provide insight into mechanisms that couple hsv-1 dna replication with transcription and repair for the coordinated expression and maintenance of the viral genome.
backgroundto date, elective nephron-sparing surgery is an established method for the exstirpation of renal tumors. while open partial nephrectomy remains the reference standard of the management of renal masses, laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (lpn) continues to evolve. conventional techniques include clamping the renal vessels risking ischaemic damage of the clamped organ. thus, new techniques are needed that combine a sufficient tissue incision for exstirpation of the tumor with an efficient coagulation to assure haemostasis and abandon renal vessel clamping in lpn. laser-excision of renal tumors during laparoscopic surgery seems to be a logical solution.methodswe performed nephron-sparing surgery without clamping of the renal vessels in 11 patients with a renal tumor in exophytic position (mean size 32 mm, ranging 8–45 mm) by laser-supported lpn.resultsregular ultrasound monitoring and insertion of a temporary drainage showed no evidence of postoperative hemorrhage. all tumors were removed with a histopathologically confirmed surrounding margin of normal renal tissue (r0 resection). serum creatinine, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were nearly unaltered before and after surgery.conclusionsthe experience won in these patients have confirmed that laser-assisted lpn without clamping of the renal vessels could be a safe and gentle alternative to classic partial nephrectomy in patients with exophytic position of renal tumors. objectives the extirpation of peripherally seated renal tumors by partial nephrectomy is an established method. to decrease the disadvantages of vascular hilar clamping, we proved the use of a laser for partial nephrectomy. to date, this laser application has only been described in the animal model.   methods with an exophytic position of the renal tumor, we successfully performed nephron-sparing surgery without clamping of the renal vessels in 5 patients.   results regular ultrasound monitoring showed no evidence of postoperative hemorrhage. the serum creatinine, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were nearly unaltered before and after surgery.   conclusions the results of our study have shown that laser-supported partial nephrectomy without clamping of the renal vessels, particular in carefully selected patients, is a safe alternative to classic partial nephrectomy.
short interval intracortical inhibition (sici) is a common paired-pulse tms technique that is used to measure gabaa-ergic inhibition in the cerebral motor cortex. however, inhibition evaluated with an interstimulus interval (isi) between the tms pulses of 2.5 ms has quite different properties from that seen at 1 ms. it is thought that the latter may represent either (or both) a different type of synaptic inhibition or refractoriness of neural membranes. the present experiments provide further evidence about the early and late components of sici using transcranial direct current stimulation (tdcs), a technique thought to change neural excitability by polarising the nerve membranes. we assessed sici using a threshold tracking method at a range of isis during concurrent application of tdcs in 11 healthy volunteers (8 males, 27–43 years old). each subject underwent both anodal and cathodal tdcs with two different intensities of stimulation (1 and 2 ma). because there was no significant difference between the results at the two intensities, the data were combined. principal component analysis was used to separate the contributions of early and late sici to the time course of inhibition from 1 to 5 ms tdcs had opposite effects on early and late sici. anodal tdcs reduced late sici but enhanced early sici, whereas cathodal tdcs had the opposite effect. this is further evidence that the two phases of sici are produced by different mechanisms, perhaps involving different sets of neurones or different locations on the same neurone that respond oppositely to tdcs. short-interval intracortical inhibition (sici) is a widely used method to study cortical inhibition, and abnormalities have been found in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. previous studies suggested that sici involves two phases and the first phase may be explained by axonal refractoriness. our objectives are to further investigate the mechanisms of the two phases of sici. sici was studied in 11 normal volunteers by a paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) paradigm applied to the left motor cortex with a subthreshold conditioning stimulus (80% resting motor threshold for rest condition and 95% active motor threshold for active condition) followed by a suprathreshold test stimulus at interstimulus intervals (isis) of 1–4.5 ms in steps of 0.5 ms. motor-evoked potentials (meps) were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. three different test stimulus intensities adjusted to produce 0.2, 1 and 4 mv meps at rest were studied with the target muscle relaxed and during 20% maximum contraction. maximum inhibition was observed at isis of 1 ms and 2.5 ms for the rest condition and the difference among isis was reduced with voluntary contraction. sici increased with larger test mep amplitude and decreased with voluntary contraction. at test mep of 0.2 mv, some subjects showed facilitation and this is likely related to short-interval intracortical facilitation. for rest sici, the correlation between adjacent isis was much higher from 3 to 4.5 ms than from 1 to 2.5 ms or between 1 and 2.5 ms. there was no correlation between sici at different test mep amplitudes. we conclude that maximum sici at isis of 1 and 2.5 ms are mediated by different mechanisms. sici at 1 ms cannot be fully explained by axonal refractoriness and synaptic inhibition may be involved. sici is a complex phenomenon and inhibition at different isis may be mediated by different inhibitory circuits.
backgroundmagnetic resonance (mr) imaging evaluation of the painful failed shoulder arthroplasty is a useful imaging modality due to advancements in metal artifact reduction techniques, which allow assessment of the integrity of the supporting soft-tissue envelope and the implant.questions/purposesthe focus of this pictorial review is to illustrate the benefits of mr imaging, whether used alone or as an adjunct to other imaging modalities, in aiding the clinician in the complex decision making process.methodsa pubmed (medline) search focusing on the complications and imaging assessment of shoulder arthroplasty was performed. articles were selected for review based on their pertinence to the aforementioned topics.resultswe discuss the ability of mr imaging to identify why a patient’s arthroplasty may have failed. specific causes including component loosening and implant failure, rotator cuff and deltoid integrity, infection, subtle fractures, and nerve pathology are reviewed, with illustrative sample images.conclusionmri is a valuable tool in the assessment for pathology in the shoulder following arthroplasty. total shoulder arthroplasty, originally used by pean in 1893 to treat tuberculous arthritis1 and subsequently modernized by neer et al. in the 1950s for the treatment of three and four-part proximal humeral fractures2, has demonstrated clinical efficacy when used for the treatment of primary and secondary degenerative conditions of the shoulder. the overall number of shoulder replacements has increased in parallel to the total number of total joint arthroplasties. approximately 7000 total shoulder replacements were performed annually in the united states from 1996 through 2002. this represents a 40% increase compared with the 5000 arthroplasties per year performed from 1990 through 19923-11. despite the increase in the annual volume of shoulder arthroplasties, data have suggested that nearly three-fourths of the operations are performed by surgeons who do two or fewer procedures a year12,13. the favorability of the clinical outcomes of total shoulder arthroplasty as well as the decision to proceed with a total shoulder replacement instead of a hemiarthroplasty have been shown to depend on surgeon experience and hospital volume12-16. patient readmission rates, complication rates, and lengths of hospital stays have all been shown to …
fertiloscopy represents an alternative to laparoscopy in the diagnostic evaluation of unexplained infertility or for the purpose of ovarian drilling. the learning curve of fertiloscopy in an experienced laparoscopic surgeon was evaluated in a prospective multicentre observational trial. a total of 110 fertiloscopies were carried out. at centre 1, a beginner, and at centre 2, an expert in fertiloscopy, performed the procedures. in three cases in centre 1, and in 0 cases in centre 2, the procedure was converted to transabdominal laparoscopy owing to intraoperative complications. median operating time was longer at centre 1 during the first 40 procedures (p < 0.001) and equal thereafter. analyzing fertiloscopies with and without ovarian drilling separately, operating time was only longer for the first 20 procedures in each group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002). in a multivariate analysis, intraoperative complications and fertiloscopy with ovarian drilling (compared with diagnostic fertiloscopy) were associated with longer duration of surgery (p < 0.001 for both parameters). an increasing consecutive number of fertiloscopies was associated with shorter duration of surgery (p < 0.001). experienced laparoscopists should consider a transition towards fertiloscopy in the diagnostic workup of unexplained infertility or for the purpose of ovarian drilling. study objective to prospectively analyze the learning curve of laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (lavh) in a surgical team and evaluate if length of surgery can be reduced safely.   design prospective observational study (canadian task force classification ii-2).   setting department of obstetrics and gynecology in a university-affiliated hospital.   patients one hundred and sixty consecutive women undergoing lavh performed between january 1, 1998 and april 30, 2001.   intervention lavh (aagl classification system for laparoscopic hysterectomy iii-b-3).   measurements and main results the primary parameter evaluated was length of surgery. patients were grouped in cohorts of 10, in order to perform a time curve that would assist us in evaluation of the learning process. once the plateau was reached, we evaluated the process before and after this plateau (groups 1 [learning stage] and 2 [second stage], respectively). average length of surgery was 126 minutes (range, 60-260). length of surgery was 138 minutes (range, 75-260) in the learning stage (first 80 cases) and 112 minutes (range, 60-225) in the second stage (p <.0001). total rate of complications was 11.6%. there were three major complications, and they occurred before the plateau. there were 15 minor complications (9.67%), 8 during the first stage and 7 in the second stage, (p =.9; ns). a second learning curve excluding lavh with associated surgeries was obtained. the average length of surgery for the first stage was 133 minutes (range, 75-205) and 102 minutes for the second stage (range, 60-130) (p >.0001).   conclusion analysis of the learning curve demonstrated that the length of surgery in lavh could be reduced without increasing the number of complications.
connexins form gap junction channels that provide a hydrophilic path between cell interiors. some connexins, particularly the lens connexins, cx46 and cx50 and their orthologs, can form functional hemichannels in nonjunctional membranes. these hemichannels are a nonselective conduit to the extracellular medium and may jeopardize cell survival. the physiological function of hemichannels has remained elusive, but it has been postulated that hemichannels are involved in atp-release caused by mechanical stimulation. here we show with single-channel and whole cell electrophysiological studies that cx46 hemichannels are mechanosensitive, like other families of ion channels and membrane-bound enzymes. the hemichannel response to mechanical stress is bipolar. at negative potentials stress opens the channel, and at positive potentials stress closes it. physiologically, cx46 hemichannels may assist accommodation of the ocular lens by providing a transient path for volume flow as the lens changes shape. gap junction channels are formed by members of the connexin gene family and mediate direct intercellular communication through linked hemichannels (connexons) from each of two adjacent cells. while for most connexins, the hemichannels appear to require an apposing hemichannel to open, macroscopic currents obtained from xenopus oocytes expressing rat cx46 suggested that some hemichannels can be readily opened by membrane depolarization [paul, d. l., ebihara, l., takemoto, l. j., swenson, k. i. & goodenough, d. a. (1991), j. cell biol. 115, 1077-1089]. here we demonstrate by single channel recording that hemichannels comprised of rat cx46 exhibit complex voltage gating consistent with there being two distinct gating mechanisms. one mechanism partially closes cx46 hemichannels from a fully open state, gammaopen, to a substate, gammasub, about one-third of the conductance of gammaopen; these transitions occur when the cell is depolarized to inside positive voltages, consistent with gating by transjunctional voltage in cx46 gap junctions. the other gating mechanism closes cx46 hemichannels to a fully closed state, gammaclosed, on hyperpolarization to inside negative voltages and has unusual characteristics; transitions between gammaclosed and gammaopen appear slow (10-20 ms), often involving several transient substates distinct from gammasub. the polarity of activation and kinetics of this latter form of gating indicate that it is the mechanism by which these hemichannels open in the cell surface membrane when unapposed by another hemichannel. cx46 hemichannels display a substantial preference for cations over anions, yet have a large unitary conductance (approximately 300 ps) and a relatively large pore as inferred from permeability to tetraethylammonium (approximately 8.5 angstroms diameter). these hemichannels open at physiological voltages and could induce substantial cation fluxes in cells expressing cx46.
background it is estimated that there is at least a 2-fold rise in the incidence of monozygotic twinning after assisted reproductive technology compared with natural conception. this can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes.   methods we searched medline, embase and scisearch for studies that estimated the risk of monozygotic twinning and its association with any particular assisted reproductive technique. monozygotic twinning was defined by ultrasound or weinberg criteria. a meta-analysis of the proportion of monozygotic twins was performed using both fixed and random effects models.   results the search revealed 37 publications reporting on the incidence of monozygotic twins after assisted reproductive techniques. twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. the summary incidence of monozygotic twins after assisted conception was 0.9% (0.8-0.9%). the incidence of monozygotic twins in natural conception is 0.4%. blastocyst transfer and intracytoplasmic sperm injection are associated with 4.25 and 2.25 times higher risk of monozygotic twins.   conclusions the risk of monozygotic twins in assisted conception is 2.25 times higher than the natural conceptions. larger studies reporting on monozygotic twinning following single-embryo transfer or after post-natal confirmation of zygosity with dna analysis are warranted before definitive conclusions can be drawn and guidelines produced. in order to provide adequate pre-conceptional counselling, it is important to monitor the incidence of monozygotic twins in both natural and assisted conceptions. we suggest building a national multiple pregnancy database based on accurate diagnosis of zygosity. objective the purpose of our study is to compare the occurrence of monozygotic twinning (mzt) from blastocyst transfer (bt) in our program between an earlier and more recent time period.   design retrospective.   setting academic ivf practice.   patient(s) all pregnancies conceived between march 2002 and december 2005 (n = 932) in our program were compared to pregnancies conceived before march 2002 (n = 554), which were the subject of a previous study.   intervention(s) none.   main outcome measure(s) the incidence of mzt with day 3 embryo transfer and bt were compared between the study and control groups.   result(s) during the study period, the rate of mzt was not significantly different for bt at 2.3% (9/385) compared to day 3 embryo transfer at 1.8% (10/547). this rate of 2.3% for bt was significantly lower than the rate of 5.6% (11/197) reported at our institution for bt before march 2002.   conclusion(s) our study suggests that the risk of mzt with bt is significantly lower in the more recent time period and is in the range of what is seen with cleavage stage transfer. it is likely that improvements in culture systems as experience is gained with bt played a role.
following entry into non‐phagocytic hela cells, the facultative pathogen salmonella typhimurium survives and replicates within a membrane‐bound vacuole. preceding the initiation of intracellular replication there is a lag phase, during which the bacteria modulate their environment. this phase is characterized by the rapid recycling of early endosomal proteins present on the nascent vacuole followed by the acquisition of a subset of lysosomal proteins. to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of intracellular survival, we have followed the biogenesis of the s.typhimurium‐containing vacuole (scv) in hela cells expressing different mutant forms of the small gtpase rab7. we demonstrate that the scv recruits pre‐existing lysosomal glycoproteins (lgps) in a rab7‐dependent manner, without directly interacting with lysosomes. we also show the transient accumulation, in the vicinity of the scv, of novel rab7‐ and lgp‐containing vesicles containing very low amounts of cathepsin d. the size of these vesicles is dependent on rab7 activity, suggesting a role for rab7 in their homotypic fusion. taken together, these results indicate that rab7 regulates scv biogenesis during the phase characterized by the rapid acquisition of lysosomal proteins. we propose that scv maturation involves its interaction with rab7/lgp‐containing vesicles which are possible intermediate cargo components of the late endocytic pathway. rab gtpases belong to the ras gtpase superfamily and are key regulators of membrane traffic. among them, rab7 has been localized on late endosomes of nrk cells but its function remains unknown. in order to investigate its role, we generated stable hela cell lines that express either wild type or a gtpase-defective mutant of rab7 in an inducible manner. a morphological analysis of the intracellular localization of these proteins was performed by confocal laser microscopy. here we show that, in hela cells, rab7 is present on a vesicular compartment that extends from the perinuclear area to the cell periphery and shows only a partial colocalization with the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, a marker for late endosomes. the topology of this compartment is dependent on the microtubule network since nocodazole treatment results in its scattering throughout the cytoplasm. in addition, we observed that, in contrast to the wild-type protein, a rab7 mutant with a reduced gtpase activity is in part associated with lysosomal membranes. this observation was confirmed by subcellular fractionation in a percoll gradient. our data implicate rab7 as the first gtpase functioning on terminal endocytic structures in mammalian cells.
kutajarista is an ayurvedic fermented herbal formulation prescribed for gastrointestinal disorders. this herbal formulation undergoes a gradual fermentative process and takes around 2 months for production. in this study, microbial composition at initial stages of fermentation of kutajarista was assessed by culture independent 16s rrna gene clone library approach. physicochemical changes were also compared at these stages of fermentation. high performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis showed that gallic acid, ellagic acid, and its derivatives were the major chemical constituents recovered in this process. at 0 day of fermentation, lactobacillus sp., acinetobacter sp., alcaligenes sp., and methylobacterium sp. were recovered, but were not detected at 8 day of fermentation. initially, microbial diversity increased after 8 days of fermentation with 11 operational taxonomic units (otus), which further decreased to 3 otus at 30 day of fermentation. aeromonas sp., pseudomonas sp., and klebsiella sp. dominated till 30 day of fermentation. predominance of γ- proteobacteria and presence of gallolyl derivatives at the saturation stage of fermentation implies tannin degrading potential of these microbes. this is the first study to highlight the microbial role in an ayurvedic herbal product fermentation. abstract bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) have been domesticated and widely used for silk production. it feeds on mulberry leaves. mulberry leaves are mainly composed of pectin, xylan, cellulose and starch. some of the digestive enzymes that degrade these carbohydrates might be produced by gut bacteria. eleven isolates were obtained from the digestive tract of b. mori, including the gram positive bacillus circulans and gram negative proteus vulgaris, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, serratia liquefaciens, enterobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, p. aeruginosa, aeromonas sp., and erwinia sp.. three of these isolates, p. vulgaris, k. pneumoniae, c. freundii, were cellulolytic and xylanolytic, p. fluorescens and erwinia sp., were pectinolytic and k. pneumoniae degraded starch. aeromonas sp. was able to utilize the cmcellulose and xylan. s. liquefaciens was able to utilize three polysaccharides including cmcellulose, xylan and pectin. b. circulans was able to utilize all four polysaccharides with different efficacy. the gut of b. mori has an alkaline ph and all of the isolated bacterial strains were found to grow and degrade polysaccharides at alkaline ph. the number of cellulolytic bacteria increases with each instar.
purposewhile intervention effects in target outcomes have typically been tested based on change from baseline to post-intervention, such approaches typically ignore individual differences in change, including time taken to see improvement. the present study demonstrates how weekly patient-reported data may be used to augment traditional pre–post intervention evaluations in order to gain greater insights into treatment efficacy.methodstwo hundred and fifty-two adolescent boys and girls (mage = 13.6 years, sd = 0.6 years) from four secondary schools in victoria, australia, were assigned by school into control (n = 88) or intervention (n = 164) groups. the intervention group participated in a 6-week course designed to improve subjective wellbeing (swb) by fostering resilience, coping skills, and self-esteem. in addition to baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up assessments of swb, intervention group participants also completed weekly summarise of affective experiences for the duration of the intervention phase.resultswhile standard pre–post data showed significant improvement in swb for the intervention group relative to controls, weekly data showed individual differences in the trajectory of change during this intervention phase; low swb individuals experienced initial worsening of symptoms followed by improvement in the second half of the intervention phase, whereas high swb individuals experienced initial gains, followed by a plateau from week 4 onwards.conclusionsaddition of weekly data provided greater insights into intervention effects by: (1) contradicting the notion that early responsiveness to treatment is predictive of level of improvement by post-intervention, and (2) providing data-based insights into ways to enhance the intervention. the timing (spacing) of assessments is an important component of longitudinal research. the purpose of the present study is to determine methods of timing the collection of longitudinal data that provide better parameter recovery in mixed effects nonlinear growth modeling. a simulation study was conducted, varying function type, as well as the number of measurement occasions, in order to examine the effect of timing on the accuracy and efficiency of parameter estimates. the number of measurement occasions was associated with greater efficiency for all functional forms and was associated with greater accuracy for the intrinsically nonlinear functions. in general, concentrating measurement occasions toward the left or at the extremes was associated with increased efficiency when estimating the intercepts of intrinsically linear functions, and concentrating values where the curvature of the function was greatest generally resulted in the best recovery for intrinsically nonlinear functions. results from this study can be used in conjunction with theory to improve the design of longitudinal research studies. in addition, an r program is provided for researchers to run customized simulations to identify optimal sampling schedules for their own research.
abstractour main purpose in this paper is to introduce the notion of φ -contractive mapping in fuzzy metric spaces and to present two new re-sults on the existence and the approximation of ﬁxed point of nonlinearcontractions mappings and semigroups in fuzzy metric spaces. theseresults are of interest in view of analogous results in metric spaces (seefor example [1], [7]) mathematics subject classiﬁcation: primary 47h10, 54h25keywords: fixed point, fuzzy metric, left reversible semigroup, nonlinearcontractive conditions 1 introduction our terminology and notation for fuzzy metric spaces conform of that georgeet al. [5, 6]. recently gregori et al. [4] have showed that the study of theintuitionistic fuzzy metric space (ifms) ( x,m,n,∗,♦ ) can be reduced to thestudy of the fuzzy metric space (fms) ( x,m,∗ ). more exactly, the topology τ ( mn ) of an ifms ( x,m,n,∗,♦ ) coincides with the topology τ ( m ) generatedby the fms ( x,m,∗ ), which has as a base the family of open sets. so, ourstudy is limited to fmss.deﬁnition 1.1 where \p is some function defined on the closure of the range of p. in [3], rakotch proved that if \p(t) =ct(t)t, where a is decreasing and a(t) <1 for i>0, then a mapping satisfying (3) has a unique fixed point x0. it is an easy exercise to show that if \p(t) =a(t)t, where a is increasing, and a(/)<l for t^o, then the conclusion of banach's theorem still holds. we shall show that one need only assume that ip(t) <t for ¿>0, together with a semicontinuity condition on \[/. for a metrically convex space, even this latter condition may be dropped. a number of examples are given to show that the results do in fact improve upon those mentioned above. we wish to thank the referee for suggesting the improved version of theorem 1 which is presented in this paper. we begin with some preliminary results on metrically convex spaces. definition 1 [l, p. 41]. a metric space x is said to be metrically convex if for each x, yex, there is a z^x, y for which p(x, y) =p(x, z) +p(z, y)-
hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. it also is associated with platelet hyperactivity, which increases morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. however, the mechanisms by which hypercholesterolemia produces a procoagulant state remain undefined. atherosclerosis is associated with accumulation of oxidized lipoproteins within atherosclerotic lesions. small quantities of oxidized lipoproteins are also present in the circulation of patients with coronary artery disease. we therefore hypothesized that hypercholesterolemia leads to elevated levels of oxidized ldl (oxldl) in plasma and that this induces expression of the procoagulant protein tissue factor (tf) in monocytes. in support of this hypothesis, we report here that oxldl induced tf expression in human monocytic cells and monocytes. in addition, patients with familial hypercholesterolemia had elevated levels of plasma microparticle (mp) tf activity. furthermore, a high-fat diet induced a time-dependent increase in plasma mp tf activity and activation of coagulation in both ldl receptor-deficient mice and african green monkeys. genetic deficiency of tf in bone marrow cells reduced coagulation in hypercholesterolemic mice, consistent with a major role for monocyte-derived tf in the activation of coagulation. similarly, a deficiency of either tlr4 or tlr6 reduced levels of mp tf activity. simvastatin treatment of hypercholesterolemic mice and monkeys reduced oxldl, monocyte tf expression, mp tf activity, activation of coagulation, and inflammation, without affecting total cholesterol levels. our results suggest that the prothrombotic state associated with hypercholesterolemia is caused by oxldl-mediated induction of tf expression in monocytes via engagement of a tlr4/tlr6 complex. objective—anti-inflammatory effects of statins contribute to their clinical benefit. molecular mechanisms underlying these effects have not been well explored. because statins attenuate lipopolysaccharide (lps) responsiveness, we hypothesized that part of the pleiotropic effects are mediated through innate immunity. methods and results—toll-like receptor (tlr) 4 expression and downstream signaling in cd14+ monocytes after incubation with simvastatin and atorvastatin were quantified via flow-cytometry, quantitative rt-pcr, kinase assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. incubation with intermediates/ inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway was used to identify the mode of statin action. statin incubation resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of tlr4 expression (53±7.6% reduction compared with untreated monocytes; p<0.005), transcript levels (68±6.3%; p<0.002), decreased irak phosphorylation (37±8.3%; p<0.05), and lps-induced il-6, il-12, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-&agr;, and b7-1 expression (p<0.05). four weeks of treatment with atorvastatin significantly reduced tlr4 expression on circulating cd14+ monocytes by 36.2±4.2% (p<0.05). effects of statins were reversed by mevalonate (p=0.57). incubation with specific inhibitors of geranylgeranyltransferase (54±4.3%), farnesyltransferase (57±5.1%), or with clostridium-difficile toxin b (58±6.1%, p<0.01) imitated the statin effects. whereas wortmannin and ly294002 inhibited the statin effect (p=0.27), incubation with a specific rhoa kinase inhibitor had no effect (p=0.57). conclusions—statins influence tlr4 expression and signaling via inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation and farnesylation. these observations imply interactions with innate immunity as one pleiotropic mechanism.
effect of various voltage of electrical stimulation (es) on meat quality of lamb and goat was investigated by using a total of 36 animals at 3–5 years old. constant 50 hz frequency and 50, 100, and 250 v, 90 sec of es were administered to 1/2 carcasses and were examined according their textural, physicochemical, and sensorial characteristics. es decreased the ph values of lamb and goat meat, and accelerated the rigor mortis (p < 0.05). additionally, es enhanced the water activity, water-holding capacity, and drip loss of both animals. shear force varied between lamb and goat meat, and tenderness was improved depending on voltage range used (p < 0.001). es caused difference in instrumental colour (cie l ∗, a ∗, b ∗) values of lamb and goat meat compared with the control groups (p < 0.05) during aging period at 4°c. sensorial characteristics were also improved with various levels of es treatments. in conclusion, es had positive effects on meat quality of lamb and goat, in contrast to undesirable consumer preferences. our study examined high and low voltage electrical stimulation and postmortem storage as strategies to improve tenderness and lean color in cabrito carcasses. boer cross (n=60) kids were assigned to either high (550 v), low (20 v), or no electrical stimulation treatments. no differences in muscle temperature were observed between treatments at any time measured. muscle ph declined fastest in high voltage treated carcasses. high voltage electrical stimulation slightly increased (p<0.05) b (∗) and a (∗) in the m. gluteus medius and tended to increase l (∗) and b (∗) (p=0.06 and 0.11, respectively) values in the m. longissimus thoracis. electrical stimulation had no effect on myofibril fragmentation at 1-, 3-, or 14-d postmortem or sarcomere length. high voltage electrical stimulation increased (p<0.05) tenderness at 1- and 3-d postmortem, but not at 14-d postmortem. aging for 3 d did not affect tenderness regardless of stimulation treatment, but aging time for 14 d improved (p<0.05) tenderness. these data indicate that high voltage electrical stimulation and 14 d aging were effective in improving the tenderness of meat from cabrito carcasses.
prefrontal dysfunction in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ad/hd) has been repeatedly detected on a behavioral level, and various brain-imaging studies have elucidated the pathophysiology of ad/hd. recent advances in near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) have enabled noninvasive investigations of brain function in various mental disorders, especially major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. the objective of this preliminary study was to use nirs to evaluate changes in frontal lobe blood flow in post childhood or adult patients with ad/hd symptoms. the subjects included five patients with a range of mental disorders and ad/hd symptoms, and a matched (age, sex, and dominant hand) control group of five healthy subjects. we compared the changes in cerebral blood flow during verbal fluency tasks between the two groups. the duration of the elevated oxygenated hemoglobin was notably shorter in the ad/hd group than that in the healthy control group. we suggest that the shorter elevation durations of oxygenated hemoglobin concentrations might be a biological indicator for post childhood or adult ad/hd or of impaired executive functioning. near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) is an optical imaging method, which allows non-invasive in vivo measurements of changes in the concentration of oxygenated (o2hb) and deoxygenated (hhb) haemoglobin in cortical tissue. for the present study, we examined 13 adult adhd patients and 13 age- and gender-matched healthy controls by means of multi-channel nirs (optical topography; etg-100, hitachi medical co., japan) during performance of a working memory (n-back) paradigm. compared to the healthy control group, adhd patients showed reduced task-related increases in the concentration of o2hb in nirs channels located over the ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, indicating reduced activation during performance of the n-back task in this part of the brain. this finding was particularly apparent for the task condition with high working memory load (2-back), and was accompanied by a statistical trend towards an increased number of omission errors in the patient group. the data confirm previous findings of working memory deficits and prefrontal cortex dysfunction in patients suffering from adhd, and are discussed in the light of imaging findings and theoretical models of working memory function.
naturalistic stimuli like movies evoke complex perceptual processes, which are of great interest in the study of human cognition by functional mri (fmri). however, conventional fmri analysis based on statistical parametric mapping (spm) and the general linear model (glm) is hampered by a lack of accurate parametric models of the bold response to complex stimuli. in this situation, statistical machine-learning methods, a.k.a. multivariate pattern analysis (mvpa), have received growing attention for their ability to generate stimulus response models in a data-driven fashion. however, machine-learning methods typically require large amounts of training data as well as computational resources. in the past, this has largely limited their application to fmri experiments involving small sets of stimulus categories and small regions of interest in the brain. by contrast, the present study compares several classification algorithms known as nearest neighbor (nn), gaussian naïve bayes (gnb), and (regularized) linear discriminant analysis (lda) in terms of their classification accuracy in discriminating the global fmri response patterns evoked by a large number of naturalistic visual stimuli presented as a movie. results show that lda regularized by principal component analysis (pca) achieved high classification accuracies, above 90% on average for single fmri volumes acquired 2 s apart during a 300 s movie (chance level 0.7% = 2 s/300 s). the largest source of classification errors were autocorrelations in the bold signal compounded by the similarity of consecutive stimuli. all classifiers performed best when given input features from a large region of interest comprising around 25% of the voxels that responded significantly to the visual stimulus. consistent with this, the most informative principal components represented widespread distributions of co-activated brain regions that were similar between subjects and may represent functional networks. in light of these results, the combination of naturalistic movie stimuli and classification analysis in fmri experiments may prove to be a sensitive tool for the assessment of changes in natural cognitive processes under experimental manipulation. pattern recognition methods have shown that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) data can reveal significant information about brain activity. for example, in the debate of how object categories are represented in the brain, multivariate analysis has been used to provide evidence of a distributed encoding scheme [science 293:5539 (2001) 2425-2430]. many follow-up studies have employed different methods to analyze human fmri data with varying degrees of success [nature reviews 7:7 (2006) 523-534]. in this study, we compare four popular pattern recognition methods: correlation analysis, support-vector machines (svm), linear discriminant analysis (lda) and gaussian naïve bayes (gnb), using data collected at high field (7 tesla) with higher resolution than usual fmri studies. we investigate prediction performance on single trials and for averages across varying numbers of stimulus presentations. the performance of the various algorithms depends on the nature of the brain activity being categorized: for several tasks, many of the methods work well, whereas for others, no method performs above chance level. an important factor in overall classification performance is careful preprocessing of the data, including dimensionality reduction, voxel selection and outlier elimination.
the potent antitumor activity of certain cytokines is often achieved at the expense of unacceptable toxicity. one avenue to improve the therapeutic index of cytokines in cancer therapy consists of fusing them to monoclonal antibodies capable of a selective localization at the tumor site. we have constructed fusion proteins of interleukin-12 (il-12) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf-alpha) with l19, an antibody fragment specific to the extradomain b of fibronectin which has been shown to target tumors in animal models and in patients with cancer. these fusions display a potent antitumor activity in several immunocompetent murine models of cancer but do not lead to complete remissions of established aggressive tumors. in this article, we have evaluated the tumor-targeting properties and the anticancer activities of combinations of the two antibody-cytokine fusion proteins, as well as of a triple fusion protein between il-12, l19, and tnf-alpha. although all fusion proteins were active in vitro, the triple fusion protein failed to localize to tumors in vivo and to show significant therapeutic effects. by contrast, the combination of il-12-l19 and l19-tnf-alpha displayed potent synergistic anticancer activity and led to the eradication of f9 teratocarcinomas grafted in immunocompetent mice. when cured mice were rechallenged with tumor cells, a delayed onset of tumor growth was observed, indicating the induction of a partial antitumor vaccination effect. potent anticancer effects were achieved at doses of il-12-l19 and l19-tnf-alpha (2 micro g + 2 micro g/mouse), which were at least 5-fold lower than the maximal-tolerated dose. the combined administration of the two fusion proteins showed only a modest increase in toxicity, compared with treatments performed with the individual fusion proteins. these results show that the targeted delivery of cytokines to the tumor environment strongly potentiates their antitumor activity and that the combination treatment with il-12-l19 and l19-tnf-alpha appears to be synergistic in vivo. the potential of specifically targeting antineoplastic drugs and toxins to tumors with the use of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) reactive with tumor-associated antigens is currently being examined. n-acetyl-melphalan-moab (n-acmel-moab) conjugates have previously been shown to have greater antitumor activity than n-acmel, melphalan, or moab alone against both subcutaneous and ascites murine thymomas in mice (1). although this conjugate is also a highly selective tumor inhibitor in vitro, it may not reach all the tumor cells in a high concentration, and consequently larger tumors (greater than 0.4 cm2) cannot be eradicated. this conjugate is representative of many drug-moab conjugates in that they are unable to gain adequate access to the tumor site to exert their cytotoxic effect. to potentiate the antitumor effect of the n-acmel-moab conjugate, studies were undertaken to analyze its action in combination with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rtnf-alpha), a monokine, capable of causing acute necrosis of syngeneic tumor transplants in mice. treatment of mice with murine thymomas (0.4 to 0.6 cm2 in size) demonstrated that 30% of the tumors in mice receiving conjugate and rtnf-alpha partially or completely regressed, while no regressions were observed in the tumors of mice receiving n-acmel-anti-ly-2.1 conjugate or rtnf-alpha alone. this and other experiments indicated that the antitumor effect and tumor localization of n-acmel-moab conjugates can be enhanced in vivo by rtnf-alpha, thereby enabling successful eradication of larger established subcutaneous murine tumors.
hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (hif-1) is an important transcriptional factor in mammalian cells for coordination of adaptive responses to hypoxia. it consists of a regulatory subunit hif-1α, which accumulates under hypoxic conditions, and a constitutively expressed subunit hif-1β. in addition to the well characterized oxygen-dependent mode of action of hif-1, recent work has shown that various growth factors and cytokines stimulate hif-1α expression, thereby triggering transcription of numerous hypoxia-inducible genes by oxygen-independent mechanisms. in this study, we examined whether accumulation of hif-1α induced by insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1) has a regulatory role in excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal neuron cultures. our results show that igf-1 induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in hif-1α expression that was blocked by pretreatment with selective igf-1 receptor antagonist, transcriptional inhibitor, and translational inhibitors. in addition, pharmacological blockade of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt/mammalian target of the rapamycin signaling pathway, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase, inhibited igf-1-induced hif-1α expression. more importantly, the increase in hif-1α expression induced by igf-1 was accompanied by increasing levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) mrna and protein, which enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission. in parallel, blockade of hif-1α activity by echinomycin or lentiviral infection with dominant-negative mutant hif-1α or short hairpin rna targeting hif-1α inhibited the increase in expression of vegf and the enhancement of synaptic transmission induced by igf-1. conversely, transfection of constitutively active hif-1α into neurons mimicked the effects of igf-1 treatment. together, these results suggest that hif-1α accumulation can enhance excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons by regulating production of vegf. in addition to its potent effects on vasculature, it has become clear that vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) has effects on both neurons and glia, and recent studies suggest that it can be neuroprotective. to determine potential mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection, recombinant human vegf was bath applied to adult rat hippocampal slices, and both extracellular and intracellular recordings were used to examine intrinsic properties and synaptic responses of hippocampal principal neurons. initial studies in area ca1 showed that vegf significantly reduced the amplitude of responses elicited by schaffer collateral stimulation, without influencing membrane properties. similar effects occurred in ca3 pyramidal cells and dentate gyrus granule cells when their major glutamatergic afferents were stimulated. because vegf expression is increased after seizures, effects of vegf were also examined in rats with recurrent spontaneous seizures. vegf reduced spontaneous discharges in slices from these rats but had surprisingly little effect on epileptiform discharges produced by disinhibition of slices from control rats. these results demonstrate a previously unknown effect of vegf on neuronal activity and also demonstrate a remarkable potency in the epileptic brain. based on this, we suggest that vegf or vegf-related targets could provide useful endpoints to direct novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy.
abstract speech articulation requires precise control of and coordination between the effectors of the vocal tract (e.g., lips, tongue, soft palate, and larynx). however, it is unclear how the cortex represents movements of and contact between these effectors during speech, or how these cortical responses relate to inter‐regional anatomical borders. here, we used phase‐encoded fmri to map somatomotor representations of speech articulations. phonetically trained participants produced speech phones, progressing from front (bilabial) to back (glottal) place of articulation. maps of cortical myelin proxies (r1 = 1/t1) further allowed us to situate functional maps with respect to anatomical borders of motor and somatosensory regions. across participants, we found a consistent topological map of place of articulation, spanning the central sulcus and primary motor and somatosensory areas, that moved from lateral to inferior as place of articulation progressed from front to back. phones produced at velar and glottal places of articulation activated the inferior aspect of the central sulcus, but with considerable across‐subject variability. r1 maps for a subset of participants revealed that articulator maps extended posteriorly into secondary somatosensory regions. these results show consistent topological organization of cortical representations of the vocal apparatus in the context of speech behavior. the sensory projections from the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx are crucial in assuring safe deglutition, coughing, breathing, and voice production/speaking. although several studies using neuroimaging techniques have demonstrated cortical activation related to pharyngeal and laryngeal functions, little is known regarding sensory projections from the laryngeal area to the somatosensory cortex. the purpose of this study was to establish the cortical activity evoked by somatic air-puff stimulation at the laryngeal mucosa using magnetoencephalography. twelve healthy volunteers were trained to inhibit swallowing in response to air stimuli delivered to the larynx. minimum norm estimates was performed on the laryngeal somatosensory evoked fields (lsefs) to best differentiate the target activations from non-task-related activations. evoked magnetic fields were recorded with acceptable reproducibility in the left hemisphere, with a peak latency of approximately 100ms in 10 subjects. peak activation was estimated at the caudolateral region of the primary somatosensory area (s1). these results establish the ability to detect lsefs with an acceptable reproducibility within a single subject and among subjects. these results also suggest the existence of laryngeal somatic afferent input to the caudolateral region of s1 in human. our findings indicate that further investigation in this area is needed, and should focus on laryngeal lateralization, swallowing, and speech processing.
background the usefulness of plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (ngal) concentration for predicting the outcome of community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is unclear. we evaluated the prognostic value of plasma ngal concentration for predicting disease severity in comparison with other widely used biological markers of inflammation in patients with cap.   methods ngal, procalcitonin, and c-reactive protein concentrations were measured in 362 patients with cap, who were followed for up to 30days. the pneumonia severity index (psi) and curb-65 score were obtained for all patients.   results the median plasma ngal concentration increased with cap severity classified according to the psi. plasma ngal concentration was higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors. the auc for predicting mortality was highest for ngal concentration (0.871), followed by that for psi (0.865) and procalcitonin concentration (0.744). multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that plasma ngal concentration was an independent predictor of hospital mortality in cap patients. plasma ngal concentration correlated positively with c-reactive protein and procalcitonin concentrations, curb-65 score, and psi.   conclusions plasma ngal concentration is a valuable biological marker in the assessment of the severity and prediction of the prognosis of patients with cap in the emergency department. purposeto study the impact of inflammation/sepsis on the concentrations of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (ngal) in plasma and urine in adult intensive care unit (icu) patients and to estimate the predictive properties of ngal in plasma and urine for early detection of acute kidney injury (aki) in patients with septic shock.methodssixty-five patients admitted to the general icu at the karolinska university hospital solna, sweden, with normal plasma creatinine were assessed for eligibility. twenty-seven patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs), severe sepsis, or septic shock without aki and 18 patients with septic shock and concomitant aki were included in the final analysis. plasma and urine were analyzed twice daily for plasma ngal (pngal), c-reactive protein (crp), procalcitonin, myeloperoxidase, plasma cystatin c, plasma creatinine, urine ngal (ungal), urine cystatin c, and urine α1-microglobulin.resultsof the 45 patients, 40 had elevated peak levels of pngal. peak levels of pngal were not significantly different between septic shock patients with and without aki. peak levels of ungal were below the upper reference limit in all but four patients without aki. ungal was a good predictor (area under roc 0.86) whereas pngal was a poor predictor (area under roc 0.67) for aki within the next 12 h in patients with septic shock.conclusionspngal is raised in patients with sirs, severe sepsis, and septic shock and should be used with caution as a marker of aki in icu patients with septic shock. ungal is more useful in predicting aki as the levels are not elevated in septic patients without aki.
purpose   this paper presents a highly accurate cross-sectional preparation technique. the research aim was to develop an adequate imaging modality for both soft and bony tissue structures featuring high contrast and high resolution. therefore, the advancement of an already existing microgrinding procedure was pursued. the central objectives were to preserve spatial relations and to ensure the accurate three-dimensional reconstruction of histological sections.methods   twelve human temporal bone specimens including middle and inner ear structures were utilized. they were embedded in epoxy resin, then dissected by serial grinding and finally digitalized. the actual abrasion of each grinding slice was measured using a tactile length gauge with an accuracy of one micrometre. the cross-sectional images were aligned with the aid of artificial markers and by applying a feature-based, custom-made auto-registration algorithm. to determine the accuracy of the overall reconstruction procedure, a well-known reference object was used for comparison. to ensure the compatibility of the histological data with conventional clinical image data, the image stacks were finally converted into the dicom standard.results   the image fusion of data from temporal bone specimens’ and from non-destructive flat-panel-based volume computed tomography confirmed the spatial accuracy achieved by the procedure, as did the evaluation using the reference object.conclusion   this systematic and easy-to-follow preparation technique enables the three-dimensional (3d) histological reconstruction of complex soft and bony tissue structures. it facilitates the creation of detailed and spatially correct 3d anatomical models. such models are of great benefit for image-based segmentation and planning in the field of computer-assisted surgery as well as in finite element analysis. in the context of human inner ear surgery, three-dimensional histology will improve the experimental evaluation and determination of intra-cochlear trauma after the insertion of an electrode array of a cochlear implant system. abstract conclusion: candidates for hearing preservation cochlear implant (ci) surgery can be divided into: those who benefit from electrical complement (ec) to remaining hearing and don't require additional amplification, those using a combined electric-acoustic stimulation (eas) and those with the least amount of residual hearing who benefit from electric-only stimulation (es) provided via medium length electrode. objectives: patients with a borderline level of residual hearing may benefit from a hybrid electric stimulation and acoustic amplification (eas) after a cochlear implantation procedure aimed at hearing preservation. however, there is another group of individuals who possess substantial low-frequency residual hearing that is still functional. these partially deaf patients present a ‘cliff-like’ audiogram and have difficulty in comfortable listening, especially in noisy conditions and are deprived of the full enjoyment of music. methods: eleven adults and seven children were implanted via round window with insertion depth intentionally limited to 18–22 mm. none of them could benefit from hearing aids before surgery and they were considered for ec to their residual hearing. results: pure tone audiograms and discrimination scores show benefit from either ec to conserved natural acoustic hearing or eas. one patient with a loss of functional residual hearing benefited from electrical stimulation (es) and a standard ci coding strategy.
alpha-herpesviruses, including human herpes simplex virus 1 & 2, varicella zoster virus and the swine pseudorabies virus (prv), infect the peripheral nervous system of their hosts. symptoms of infection often include itching, numbness, or pain indicative of altered neurological function. to determine if there is an in vitro electrophysiological correlate to these characteristic in vivo symptoms, we infected cultured rat sympathetic neurons with well-characterized strains of prv known to produce virulent or attenuated symptoms in animals. whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made at various times after infection. by 8 hours of infection with virulent prv, action potential (ap) firing rates increased substantially and were accompanied by hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials and spikelet-like events. coincident with the increase in ap firing rate, adjacent neurons exhibited coupled firing events, first with ap-spikelets and later with near identical resting membrane potentials and ap firing. small fusion pores between adjacent cell bodies formed early after infection as demonstrated by transfer of the low molecular weight dye, lucifer yellow. later, larger pores formed as demonstrated by transfer of high molecular weight texas red-dextran conjugates between infected cells. further evidence for viral-induced fusion pores was obtained by infecting neurons with a viral mutant defective for glycoprotein b, a component of the viral membrane fusion complex. these infected neurons were essentially identical to mock infected neurons: no increased ap firing, no spikelet-like events, and no electrical or dye transfer. infection with prv bartha, an attenuated circuit-tracing strain delayed, but did not eliminate the increased neuronal activity and coupling events. we suggest that formation of fusion pores between infected neurons results in electrical coupling and elevated firing rates, and that these processes may contribute to the altered neural function seen in prv-infected animals. we provide physiological, pharmacological, and structural evidence that axons of hippocampal principal cells are electrically coupled, with prepotentials or spikelets forming the physiological substrate of electrical coupling as observed in cell somata. antidromic activation of neighboring axons induced somatic spikelet potentials in neurons of ca3, ca1, and dentate gyrus areas of rat hippocampal slices. somatic invasion by these spikelets was dependent on the activation of fast na(+) channels in the postjunctional neuron. antidromically elicited spikelets were suppressed by gap junction blockers and low intracellular ph. paired axo-somatic and somato-dendritic recordings revealed that the coupling potentials appeared in the axon before invading the soma and the dendrite. using confocal laser scanning microscopy we found that putative axons of principal cells were dye coupled. our data thus suggest that hippocampal neurons are coupled by axo-axonal junctions, providing a novel mechanism for very fast electrical communication.
copy number variants (cnvs) detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (cma) significantly contribute to understanding the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (asd) and other related conditions. in recognition of the value of cma testing and its impact on medical management, cma is in medical guidelines as a first-tier test in the evaluation of children with these disorders. as cma becomes adopted into routine care for these patients, it becomes increasingly important to report these clinical findings. this study summarizes the results of over 4 years of cma testing by a clia-certified clinical testing laboratory. using a 2.8 million probe microarray optimized for the detection of cnvs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, we report an overall cnv detection rate of 28.1% in 10,351 consecutive patients, which rises to nearly 33% in cases without asd, with only developmental delay/intellectual disability (dd/id) and/or multiple congenital anomalies (mca). the overall detection rate for individuals with asd is also significant at 24.4%. the detection rate and pathogenic yield of cma vary significantly with the indications for testing, age, and gender, as well as the specialty of the ordering doctor. we note discrete differences in the most common recurrent cnvs found in individuals with or without a diagnosis of asd. copy number variants (cnvs) as detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (cma) significantly contribute to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as developmental delay (dd), intellectual disability (id), and autism spectrum disorder (asd). this study summarizes the results of 3.5 years of cma testing by a clia-certified clinical testing laboratory 5487 patients with neurodevelopmental conditions were clinically evaluated for rare copy number variants using a 2.8-million probe custom cma optimized for the detection of cnvs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. we report an overall detection rate of 29.4% in our neurodevelopmental cohort, which rises to nearly 33% when cases with dd/id and/or mca only are considered. the detection rate for the asd cohort is also significant, at 25%. additionally, we find that detection rate and pathogenic yield of cma vary significantly depending on the primary indications for testing, the age of the individuals tested, and the specialty of the ordering doctor. we also report a significant difference between the detection rate on the ultrahigh resolution optimized array in comparison to the array from which it originated. this increase in detection can significantly contribute to the efficient and effective medical management of neurodevelopmental conditions in the clinic.
the increasing use of enzymes in industrial processes and the importance of understanding protein folding and stability have led to several attempts to predict and quantify the effect of every possible amino acid exchange (mutation) on the thermostability of proteins. in this article we describe a knowledge-based discrimination function that acts as a fast and reliable guide in protein engineering and optimization. the function used consists of two parts, a pairwise energy function based on a distanceand direction-dependent atomic description of the amino acid environment, and a torsion angle energy function. in a first step a training set of 11 proteins including 646 mutant proteins with experimentally determined thermostability was used to optimize the knowledge-based energy functions. the resulting potential function was then tested using a test mutant database consisting of 918 various point mutations introduced in 27 proteins. the best correlation coefficient obtained for the experimental data and the predicted thermostability for the training set is r=0.81 (561 data points). a total of 76% of the mutations could be predicted correctly as being either stabilizing or destabilizing. the results for the test set are r=0.74 (747 data points) and 72%, respectively. the global correlation over the combined data (1308 mutants) obtained is 0.78. we have developed a method to both predict the geometry and the relative stability of point mutants that may be used for arbitrary mutations. the geometry optimization procedure was first tested on a new benchmark of 2141 ordered pairs of x‐ray crystal structures of proteins that differ by a single point mutation, the largest data set to date. an empirical energy function, which includes terms representing the energy contributions of the folded and denatured proteins and uses the predicted mutant side chain conformation, was fit to a training set consisting of half of a diverse set of 1816 experimental stability values for single point mutations in 81 different proteins. the data included a substantial number of small to large residue mutations not considered by previous prediction studies. after removing 22 (≈2%) outliers, the stability calculation gave a standard deviation of 1.08 kcal/mol with a correlation coefficient of 0.82. the prediction method was then tested on the remaining half of the experimental data, giving a standard deviation of 1.10 kcal/mol and covariance of 0.66 for 97% of the test set. a regression fit of the energy function to a subset of 137 mutants, for which both native and mutant structures were available, gave a prediction error comparable to that for the complete training set with predicted side chain conformations. we found that about half of the variation is due to conformation‐independent residue contributions. finally, a fit to the experimental stability data using these residue parameters exclusively suggests guidelines for improving protein stability in the absence of detailed structure information. proteins 2004. © 2004 wiley‐liss, inc.
peroxiredoxins (prx's) are a family of peroxidases that maintain thiol homeostasis by catalyzing the reduction of organic hydroperoxides, h₂o₂, and peroxynitrite. under conditions of oxidative stress, eukaryotic prx's can be inactivated by the substrate-dependent oxidation of the catalytic cysteine to sulfinic acid, which may regulate the intracellular messenger function of h₂o₂. a small redox protein, sulfiredoxin (srx), conserved only in eukaryotes, has been shown to reduce sulfinylated 2-cys prx's, adding to the complexity of the h₂o₂ signaling network. in this study, we addressed the regulation of srx expression in immunostimulated primary macrophages that produce both reactive oxygen species (ros) and nitric oxide (no(•)). we present genetic evidence that no-mediated srx up-regulation is mediated by the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (nrf2). we also show that the no(•)/srx pathway inhibits generation of ros. these results reveal a link between innate immunity and h₂o₂ signaling. we propose that an no(•)/nrf2/srx pathway participates in the maintenance of redox homeostasis in cytokine-activated macrophages and other inflammatory settings. neutrophils and other phagocytes manufacture o(2)(-) (superoxide) by the one-electron reduction of oxygen at the expense of nadph. most of the o(2)(-) reacts with itself to form h(2)o(2) (hydrogen peroxide). from these agents a large number of highly reactive microbicidal oxidants are formed, including hocl (hypochlorous acid), which is produced by the myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of cl(-) by h(2)o(2); oh(*) (hydroxyl radical), produced by the reduction of h(2)o(2) by fe(++) or cu(+); onoo(-) (peroxynitrite), formed by the reaction between o(2)(-) and no(*); and many others. these reactive oxidants are manufactured for the purpose of killing invading microorganisms, but they also inflict damage on nearby tissues, and are thought to be of pathogenic significance in a large number of diseases. included among these are emphysema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, atherosclerosis, reperfusion injury, malignancy and rheumatoid arthritis.
aniline exposure is associated with toxicity to the spleen leading to splenomegaly, hyperplasia, fibrosis and a variety of sarcomas of the spleen on chronic exposure. in earlier studies, we have shown that aniline exposure leads to iron overload, oxidative stress and activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors, which could regulate various genes leading to a tumorigenic response in the spleen. however, molecular mechanisms leading to aniline-induced cellular proliferation in the spleen remain largely unknown. this study was, therefore, undertaken on the regulation of g1 phase cell cycle proteins (cyclins), expression of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (prb) and cell proliferation in the spleen, in an experimental condition preceding a tumorigenic response. male sd rats were treated with aniline (0.5 mmol/kg/day via drinking water) for 30 days (controls received drinking water only), and splenocyte proliferation, protein expression of g1 phase cyclins, cdks and prb were measured. aniline treatment resulted in significant increases in splenocyte proliferation, based on cell counts, cell proliferation markers including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna), nuclear ki67 protein (ki67) and minichromosome maintenance (mcm), mtt assay and flow cytometric analysis. western blot analysis of splenocyte proteins from aniline-treated rats showed significantly increased expression of cyclins d1, d2, d3 and e, as compared to the controls. similarly, real-time pcr analysis showed significantly increased mrna expression for cyclins d1, d2, d3 and e in the spleens of aniline-treated rats. the overexpression of these cyclins was associated with increases in the expression of cdk4, cdk6, cdk2 as well as phosphorylation of prb protein. our data suggest that increased expression of cyclins, cdks and phosphorylation of prb protein could be critical in cell proliferation, and may contribute to aniline-induced tumorigenic response in the spleen. cell cycle progression and cell division are driven by the sequential activation of a group of serine-threonine kinases called cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). multiple cdks control the cell cycle in mammals and have been long considered essential for normal proliferation, development and homeostasis. the importance of the cdk-cyclin complexes in cell proliferation is underscored by the fact that deregulation of the cdk activity is found in virtually the whole spectrum of human tumors. advances in the cell cycle proteins in the last 25 years, since the discovery of cyclins, have been discussed and have shed even more light on this essential life sustaining process. recent information from different models for the various cyclins and cdks have made some of the generally accepted concepts of cell cycle regulation to be revised and new and exciting questions to be investigated. there is also increasing evidence that suggests that cdks such as cdc2 are also commonly targeted by viral proteins, which modulate host cell cycle machinery to benefit viral survival or replication. this review, describes some of the most recent and important us patents related to cell cycle regulation and those on viral proteins involved in cell cycle modulation particularly the g2/m phase transition and cancer therapy.
edge illumination (ei) x-ray phase contrast computed tomography (ct) can provide threedimensional distributions of the real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index ( δ β = − + n 1 i ) of the sample. phase retrieval, i.e. the separation of attenuation and refraction data from projections that contain a combination of both, is a key step in the image reconstruction process. in ei-based x-ray phase contrast ct, this is conventionally performed on the basis of two projections acquired in opposite illumination configurations (i.e. with different positions of the pre-sample mask) at each ct angle. displacing the pre-sample mask at each projection makes the scan susceptible to motor-induced misalignment and prevents a continuous sample rotation. we present an alternative method for the retrieval of attenuation and refraction data that does not require repositioning the pre-sample mask. the method is based on the reverse projection relation published by zhu et al (2010 proc. natl acad. sci. usa 107 13576–81) for grating interferometry-based x-ray phase contrast ct. we use this relation to derive a simplified acquisition strategy that allows acquiring data with a continuous sample rotation, which can reduce scan time when combined with a fast read-out detector. besides discussing the theory and the necessary alignment of the experimental setup, we present tomograms obtained with reverse projection retrieval and demonstrate their agreement with those obtained with the conventional ei retrieval. x-ray phase contrast imaging is probably the most relevant among emerging x-ray imaging techniques, and it has the proven potential of revolutionizing the field of diagnostic radiology. impressive images of a wide range of samples have been obtained, mostly at synchrotron radiation facilities. the necessity of relying on synchrotron radiation has prevented to a large extent a widespread diffusion of phase contrast imaging, thus precluding its transfer to clinical practice. a new technique, based on the use of coded apertures, was recently developed at ucl. this technique was demonstrated to provide intense phase contrast signals with conventional x-ray sources and detectors. unlike other attempts at making phase contrast imaging feasible with conventional sources, the coded-aperture approach does not impose substantial limitations and/or filtering of the radiation beam, and it therefore allows, for the first time, exposures compatible with clinical practice. the technique has been thoroughly modelled, and this paper describes the technique in detail by going through the different steps of the modelling. all the main factors influencing image quality are discussed, alongside the viability of realizing a prototype suitable for clinical use. the model has been experimentally validated and a section of the paper shows the comparison between simulated and experimental results.
backgroundmolecular biomarkers assisting risk-group assignment and subsequent treatment stratification are urgently needed for patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck region (hnscc). aberrant methylation is a frequent event in cancer and, therefore, a promising source for potential biomarkers. here, the methylation status of the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 3 (pitx3) was evaluated in hnscc.methodsusing a quantitative real-time pcr, pitx3 methylation was assessed in a cohort of 326 hnscc patients treated for localized or locally advanced disease (training cohort). the results were validated with infinium humanmethylation450 beadchip data from a 528 hnscc patient cohort (validation cohort) generated by the cancer genome atlas (tcga) research network.resultspitx3 methylation was significantly higher methylated in tumor compared to normal adjacent tissue (nat; training cohort: median methylation nat 32.3%, tumor 71.8%, p < 0.001; validation cohort: median methylation nat 16.9%, tumor 35.9%, p < 0.001). pitx3 methylation was also significantly correlated with lymph node status both in the training (p = 0.006) and validation (p < 0.001) cohort. pitx3 methylation was significantly higher in hpv-associated (p16-positive) tumors compared to p16-negative tumors (training cohort: 73.7 vs. 66.2%, p = 0.013; validation cohort: 40.0 vs. 33.1%, p = 0.015). hypermethylation was significantly associated with the risk of death (training cohort: hazard ratio (hr) = 1.80, [95% confidence interval (ci) 1.20–2.69], p = 0.005; validation cohort: hr = 1.43, [95% ci 1.05–1.95], p = 0.022). in multivariate cox analyses, pitx3 added independent prognostic information. messenger rna (mrna) expression analysis revealed an inverse correlation with pitx3 methylation in the tcga cohort.conclusionspitx3 dna methylation is an independent prognostic biomarker for overall survival in patients with hnscc and might aid in the process of risk stratification for individualized treatment. gene amplification, a common mechanism for oncogene activation in cancer, has been used as a tag for the identification of novel oncogenes. dna amplification is frequently observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) and potential oncogenes have already been reported. we applied restriction landmark genome scanning (rlgs) to study gene amplifications and low-level copy number changes in hnscc in order to locate previously uncharacterized regions with copy number gains in primary tumor samples. a total of 63 enhanced rlgs fragments, indicative of dna copy number changes, including gains of single alleles, were scored. enhanced sequences were identified from 33 different chromosomal regions including those previously reported (e.g. 3q26.3 and 11q13.3) as well as novel regions (e.g. 3q29, 8q13.1, 8q22.3, 9q32, 10q24.32, 14q32.32, 17q25.1 and 20q13.33). furthermore, our data suggest that amplicons 11q13.3 and 3q26.3–q29 may be divided into possibly two and three independent amplicons, respectively, an observation supported by published microarray expression data.
the emergence of herbicide-resistant weeds is a major threat facing modern agriculture. over 470 weedy-plant populations have developed resistance to herbicides. traditional evolutionary mechanisms are not always sufficient to explain the rapidity with which certain weed populations adapt in response to herbicide exposure. stress-induced epigenetic changes, such as alterations in dna methylation, are potential additional adaptive mechanisms for herbicide resistance. we performed methylc sequencing of arabidopsis thaliana leaves that developed after either mock treatment or two different sub-lethal doses of the herbicide glyphosate, the most-used herbicide in the history of agriculture. the herbicide injury resulted in 9,205 differentially methylated regions (dmrs) across the genome. in total, 5,914 of these dmrs were induced in a dose-dependent manner, wherein the methylation levels were positively correlated to the severity of the herbicide injury, suggesting that plants can modulate the magnitude of methylation changes based on the severity of the stress. of the 3,680 genes associated with glyphosate-induced dmrs, only 7% were also implicated in methylation changes following biotic or salinity stress. these results demonstrate that plants respond to herbicide stress through changes in methylation patterns that are, in general, dose-sensitive and, at least partially, stress-specific. glyphosate is a systemic, nonselective and most widely used herbicide in the world. the introduction of glyphosate-resistant crops in the mid-1990s resulted in a dramatic increase in the use of glyphosate herbicide making it most widely used herbicide in the world. the average maize yield loss in the field caused by pests is around 20 % but in many regions it is much higher. it is now clear that glyphosate causes broader range of physiological alterations than previously assumed and some plants gain higher level of resistance to glyphosate without the need to use genetic engineering methods. to understand the mechanisms of such heightened resistance we must first know the processes mediating the plants’ death in response to glyphosate treatment. here, we show that 12 mirnas, belonging to mir167, mir396, mir159, mir156, mir169, mir444 and mir827 families, are significantly upregulated, and one, mir166, downregulated following glyphosate treatment. these mirnas have been previously shown to be involved in abiotic stress responses and implicated in senescence. strikingly, two of the induced mirnas, mir444 and mir827, have been shown to regulate phosphate transport pathways, which seem to be common for pi and glyphosate uptake.
brassica juncea (indian mustard) is a commercially important oil seed crop, which is highly affected by many biotic stresses. among them, alternaria leaf blight and powdery mildew are the most devastating diseases leading to huge yield losses in b. juncea around the world. in this regard, genetic engineering is a promising tool that may possibly allow us to enhance the b. juncea disease resistance against these pathogens. npr1 (non-expressor of pathogen-related gene 1) is a bonafide receptor of salicylic acid (sa) which modulates multiple immune responses in plants especially activation of induced and systemic acquired resistance (sar). here, we report the isolation and characterization of new npr1 homolog (bjnpr1) from b. juncea. the phylogenetic tree constructed based on the deduced sequence of bjnpr1 with homologs from other species revealed that bjnpr1 grouped together with other known npr1 proteins of cruciferae family, and was nearest to b. napus. furthermore, expression analysis showed that bjnpr1 was upregulated after sa treatment and fungal infection but not by jasmonic acid or abscisic acid. to understand the defensive role of this gene, we generated b. juncea transgenic lines overexpressing bjnpr1, and further confirmed by pcr and southern blotting. the transgenic lines showed no phenotypic abnormalities, and constitutive expression of bjnpr1 activates defense signaling pathways by priming the expression of antifungal pr genes. moreover, bjnpr1 transgenic lines showed enhanced resistance to alternaria brassicae and erysiphe cruciferarum as there was delay in symptoms and reduced disease severity than non-transgenic plants. in addition, the rate of disease spreading to uninfected or distal parts was also delayed in transgenic plants thus suggesting the activation of sar. altogether, the present study suggests that bjnpr1 is involved in broad spectrum of disease resistance against fungal pathogens. the key regulator of salicylic acid (sa)-mediated resistance, npr1, is functionally conserved in diverse plant species, including rice (oryza sativa l.). investigation in depth is needed to provide an understanding of npr1-mediated resistance and a practical strategy for the improvement of disease resistance in the model crop rice. the rice genome contains five npr1-like genes. in our study, three rice homologous genes, osnpr1/nh1, osnpr2/nh2 and osnpr3, were found to be induced by rice bacterial blight xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and rice blast magnaporthe grisea, and the defence molecules benzothiadiazole, methyl jasmonate and ethylene. we confirmed that osnpr1 is the rice orthologue by complementing the arabidopsis npr1 mutant. over-expression of osnpr1 conferred disease resistance to bacterial blight, but also enhanced herbivore susceptibility in transgenic plants. the osnpr1-green fluorescent protein (gfp) fusion protein was localized in the cytoplasm and moved into the nucleus after redox change. mutations in its conserved cysteine residues led to the constitutive localization of osnpr1(2ca)-gfp in the nucleus and also abolished herbivore hypersensitivity in transgenic rice. different subcellular localizations of osnpr1 antagonistically regulated sa- and jasmonic acid (ja)-responsive genes, but not sa and ja levels, indicating that osnpr1 might mediate antagonistic cross-talk between the sa- and ja-dependent pathways in rice. this study demonstrates that rice has evolved an sa-mediated systemic acquired resistance similar to that in arabidopsis, and also provides a practical approach for the improvement of disease resistance without the penalty of decreased herbivore resistance in rice.
actinorhizal plants are capable of high rates of nitrogen fixation, due to their capacity to establish a root-nodule symbiosis with n2-fixing actinomycetes of the genus frankia. nodulation is an ontogenic process which requires a sequence of highly coordinated events. one of these mechanisms is the induction of defense-related events, whose precise role during nodulation is largely unknown. in order to contribute to the clarification of the involvement of defense-related genes during actinorhizal root-nodule symbiosis, we have analysed the differential expression of several genes with putative defense-related functions in casuarina glauca nodules versus non-inoculated roots. four genes encoding a chitinase (cgchi1), a glutathione s-transferase (cggst), a hairpin-inducible protein (cghin1) and a peroxidase (cgpox4) were found to be up-regulated in mature nodules compared to roots. in order to find out to which extend were the encoded proteins involved in nodule protection, development or both, gene regulation studies in response to sa and wounding as well as phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequences were performed. these were further characterized through expression studies after sa-treatment and wounding, and by phylogenetic analysis. we suggest that cgchi1 and cggst are involved in defense or microsymbiont control and cgpox4 is involved in nodule development. for cghin1 the question “defense, development or both” remains open. plant peroxidases (class iii peroxidases) are present in all land plants. they are members of a large multigenic family. probably due to this high number of isoforms, and to a very heterogeneous regulation of their expression, plant peroxidases are involved in a broad range of physiological processes all along the plant life cycle. due to two possible catalytic cycles, peroxidative and hydroxylic, peroxidases can generate reactive oxygen species (ros) (•oh, hoo•), polymerise cell wall compounds, and regulate h2o2 levels. by modulating their activity and expression following internal and external stimuli, peroxidases are prevalent at every stage of plant growth, including the demands that the plant meets in stressful conditions. these multifunctional enzymes can build a rigid wall or produce ros to make it more flexible; they can prevent biological and chemical attacks by raising physical barriers or by counterattacking with a large production of ros; they can be involved in a more peaceful symbiosis. they are finally present from the first hours of a plant’s life until its last moments. although some functions look paradoxical, the whole process is probably regulated by a fine-tuning that has yet to be elucidated. this review will discuss the factors that can influence this delicate balance.
abstract the corrosion inhibitor 1h-benzotriazole (pk a  = 8.4) can exist in two different forms in natural waters, and photochemical transformation is a potentially significant attenuation pathway for both of them. depending on conditions, the modelled half-life times range from some days/weeks to several months. in sunlit water bodies, the acidic (neutral) form would undergo direct photolysis (accounting for up to 7% of total phototransformation) and, most notably, reaction with the hydroxyl radicals ( · oh) and the triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter ( 3 cdom*). the basic (anionic) form would undergo significant transformation with · oh and 3 cdom*. the · oh reactions would be more important at low dissolved organic carbon (doc) and the 3 cdom* processes at high doc. in the presence of highly reactive triplet-state model compounds, the two benzotriazole forms react with similar rate constants. in this case, they would show comparable half-life times in surface-water environments. with less reactive triplet states, the rate constant of the anionic form can be a couple of orders of magnitude higher than that of the neutral one. under these circumstances, the neutral form could be considerably more photostable than the anionic one at high doc. therefore, depending on 3 cdom* reactivity, the solution ph may or may not play an important role in the photoattenuation kinetics of 1h-benzotriazole in sunlit natural waters, especially at high doc. both forms of benzotriazole yield hydroxyderivatives as their main transformation intermediates under all the relevant photochemical reaction pathways. these intermediates could be formed via · oh-induced hydroxylation, or upon electron abstraction followed by reaction with water. differently from uvc irradiation data reported in previous studies, the concentration of aniline upon excitation of 1h-benzotriazole under environmentally significant uv wavelengths was always below the detection limit of the analytical method used in this work (5 μmol l − 1 ). the occurrence and removal of 58 pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, corrosion inhibitors, biocides, and pesticides, were assessed in the wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) of the city of lausanne, switzerland, as well as in the effluent-receiving water body, the vidy bay of lake geneva. an analytical screening method to simultaneously measure all of the 58 micropollutants was developed based on ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (uplc-ms/ms). the selection of pharmaceuticals was primarily based on a prioritization study, which designated them as environmentally relevant for the lake geneva region. except for the endocrine disruptor 17alpha-ethinylestradiol, all substances were detected in 24-h composite samples of wastewater entering the wwtp or in the treated effluent. of these compounds, 40% were also detected in raw drinking water, pumped from the lake 3 km downstream of the wwtp. the contributions of dilution and degradation to micropollutant elimination between the wwtp outlet and the raw drinking water intake were established in different model scenarios using hypothetical residence times of the wastewater in vidy bay of 1, 4, or 90 d. concentration decrease due to processes other than dilution was observed for diclofenac, beta-blockers, several antibiotics, corrosion inhibitors, and pesticides. measured environmental concentrations (mecs) of pharmaceuticals were compared to the predicted environmental concentrations (pecs) determined in the prioritization study and agreed within one order of magnitude, but mecs were typically greater than the corresponding pecs. predicted no-effect concentrations of the analgesic paracetamol, and the two antibiotics ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole, were exceeded in raw drinking water samples and therefore present a potential risk to the ecosystem.
the effect of the orientation of the cutting planes producing planar curves over the surface of an object on its perceived pose and shape was investigated for line drawings representing three-dimensional objects. the results suggest that the orientational flow produced by the surface curves introduces an apparent object rotation in depth and in the image plane and changes in its perceived elongation. the apparent location of the nearest points is determined by the points of maximal view-dependent unsigned curvature of the surface curves. the data are discussed in relation to the interaction of the shape-from-silhouette system and shape-from-contour system and its effect on the interpretation of the surface contours with respect to the surface geometry. most existing computational models of the visual perception of three-dimensional shape from texture are based on assumed constraints about how texture is distributed on visible surfaces. the research described in the present article was designed to investigate how violations of these assumptions influence human perception. observers were presented with images of smoothly curved surfaces depicted with different types of texture, whose distribution of surface markings could be both anisotropic and inhomogeneous. observers judged the pattern of ordinal depth on each object by marking local maxima and minima along designated scan lines. they also judged the apparent magnitudes of relative depth between designated probe points on the surface. the results revealed a high degree of accuracy and reliability in all conditions, except for a systematic underestimation of the overall magnitude of surface relief. these findings suggest that human perception of three-dimensional shape from texture is much more robust than would be reasonable to expect based on current computational models of this phenomenon.
unlabelled recent research has shown that the noncontingent delivery of competing stimuli can effectively reduce rates of destructive behavior maintained by social-positive reinforcement, even when the contingency for destructive behavior remains intact. it may be useful, therefore, to have a systematic means for predicting which reinforcers do and do not compete successfully with the reinforcer that is maintaining destructive behavior. in the present study, we conducted a brief competing stimulus assessment in which noncontingent access to a variety of tangible stimuli (one toy per trial) was superimposed on a fixed-ratio 1 schedule of attention for destructive behavior for individuals whose behavior was found to be reinforced by attention during a functional analysis. tangible stimuli that resulted in the lowest rates of destructive behavior and highest percentages of engagement during the competing stimulus assessment were subsequently used in a noncontingent tangible items plus extinction treatment package and were compared to noncontingent attention plus extinction and extinction alone. results indicated that both treatments resulted in greater reductions in the target behavior than did extinction alone and suggested that the competing stimulus assessment may be helpful in predicting stimuli that can enhance the effects of extinction when noncontingent attention is unavailable.   descriptors attention-maintained problem behavior, competing stimuli, extinction, functional analysis, noncontingent reinforcement we present one method for distinguishing between extinction and punishment effects. the proportion of responses that produced a consequence (blocking) was varied while hand mouthing was treated in a man diagnosed with profound mental retardation. response patterns across the schedule changes suggested that the blocking procedure functioned as a punishing event.
amyloid beta (aβ) homeostasis in the brain is governed by its production and clearance mechanisms. an imbalance in this homeostasis results in pathological accumulations of cerebral aβ, a characteristic of alzheimer’s disease (ad). while aβ may be cleared by several physiological mechanisms, a major route of aβ clearance is the vascular-mediated removal of aβ from the brain across the blood-brain barrier (bbb). here, we discuss the role of the predominant aβ clearance protein—low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (lrp1)—in the efflux of aβ from the brain. we also outline the multiple factors that influence the function of lrp1-mediated aβ clearance, such as its expression, shedding, structural modification and transcriptional regulation by other genes. finally, we summarize approaches aimed at restoring lrp1-mediated aβ clearance from the brain. , 212ra161 (2013); 5  sci transl med et al. eloise hudry of amyloid deposition and neurotoxicity in mouse brain isoforms results in differential modulation apoe gene transfer of human editor's summary protection. -mediated apoe2 risk or enhancing apoe4 and may help to guide development of therapies aimed at mitigating in amyloid deposition apoe4 . these results confirm a major role for apoe2 in the brains of mice receiving human variant did the opposite with shrinking of some amyloid plaques and plaque-associated damage apoe2 contrast, the in increased the rate at which amyloid plaques developed and increased plaque-associated damage to brain neurons. variant apoe4 transgenic mice with amyloid plaques, a pathological characteristic of ad. introduction of the high-risk human gene variant or the apoe2, protective human gene variant to apoe4 therapy to deliver the isoforms affect the risk of developing ad. the authors used gene apoe that might help to explain how these different . use a transgenic mouse model of ad and advanced microscopy techniques to examine one mechanism et al hudry gene, one form of the gene increases the risk of developing ad, whereas another form decreases the risk. apoe the certain genes help to determine the chance that someone will develop alzheimer's disease (ad). in the case of variants and risk in alzheimer's disease
backgrounddesmoglein 1 (dsg1) is the target protein in the skin disease exudative epidermitis in pigs caused by virulent strains of staphylococcus hyicus. the exfoliative toxins produced by s. hyicus digest the porcine desmoglein 1 (pig)dsg1 by a very specific reaction. this study investigated the location of single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in the porcine desmoglein 1 gene (pig)dsg1 in correlation to the cleavage site as well as if the genotype of the snps is correlated to susceptibility or resistance to the disease.resultsdna from 32 affected and 32 unaffected piglets with exudative epidermitis were diagnosed clinically as affected or unaffected. two regions of the desmoglein 1 gene were sequenced and genotypes of the snps were established. seven snps (823t>c, 828a>g, 829a>g, 830a>t, 831a>t, 838a>c and 1139c>t) were found in the analysed sequences and the allele frequencies were determined for the snps resulting in amino acid change. four of the seven polymorphisms were situated in the motif known to be important for toxin cleavage. the distribution of the genotypes between affected and unaffected animals was analysed.conclusionthe study indicated a possible correlation between the genotypes of two out of seven snps found in the porcine desmoglein 1 gene and the susceptibility to exudative epidermitis. aims:  to develop a multiplex pcr for detection of genes encoding the exfoliative toxins exha, exhb, exhc and exhd from staphylococcus hyicus and to estimate the prevalence of exfoliative toxins among staph. hyicus isolates from danish pig herds with exudative epidermitis (ee).
kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (khe) is a rare locally aggressive vascular neoplasm characterized by infiltrating nodules and sheets of spindle cells, and unmistakable resemblance to kaposi's sarcoma. khe occurs mainly in newborns and infants and presents most commonly in the skin, deep soft tissue, and bone. we report a case of khe in a 36-year-old female who presented with a spleen mass and underwent splenectomy. macroscopic examination revealed a large, dark-red, firm mass in the spleen. histologically, the tumor consisted of irregular, infiltrating nodules of densely packed spindle-shaped tumor cells closely associated with small slit-like and sieve-like blood vessels, which were separated with hyalinized hypocellular fibrous stroma. immunohistochemically, both spindle and epithelioid cells were positive for cd34, cd31, and vimentin, but negative for ema, cytokeratin, cd21, cd35, cd1a, and s-100 protein. the well-formed capillaries and mature vessels but not spindle tumor cell showed reactivity for factor viii- related antigen. alpha-smooth muscle actin was detected in pericytes surrounding small round or slit-like capillaries. the final histologic diagnosis was khe. follow-up 6 month after operation revealed no sign of recurrence or metastasis.to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of khe arising in the spleen. we report the clinical and pathological features of nine distinctive, but relatively unknown, vascular tumors of infancy and childhood presenting as soft tissue masses often associated with locally aggressive disease, lymphangiomatosis and kasabach-merritt syndrome. the patients, four males and five females, were all in their first decade of life except for two (median, 2 years; range, 5 months to 19 years). these tumors involved deep soft tissues of the upper extremity (four cases), retroperitoneum (two cases), chest wall, scalp, and neck (one case each). four patients also had kasabach-merritt syndrome, and three patients had lymphangiomatosis. lymphangiomatosis consisted of diffusely infiltrating lymphangioma of soft tissue (three cases) and in two by the additional presence of bone lesions. in one of these three cases, lymphangiomatosis antedated the diagnosis of the vascular tumor, and in the remainder they were concurrently diagnosed. tumors were characterized by infiltrating, interconnecting sheets or irregular nodules of slender endothelial cells lining crescentic or slit-like vessels and, less commonly, rounded capillary-type vessels. within some tumors, nests of epithelioid endothelial cells with prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm containing finely granular hemosiderin, hyaline droplets, and cytoplasmic vacuoles were identified. smaller amounts of hemosiderin were observed within the spindled endothelial cells and microthrombi could be seen occasionally within the tiny lumina. nuclear atypia was minimal within these tumors and mitotic figures were infrequent, averaging 2 to 3/10 high-power fields (hpf) (range 0-7/10 hpf). larger, well-formed feeding vessels were present at the periphery of the tumor. the endothelium of these vessels expressed factor viii-ag, cd34, and bound ulex europaeus, and muscle- specific actin. in contrast, the spindled tumor cells expressed only cd34. human papilloma virus (hpv)-16- like dna transcripts, which have been identified in cases of kaposi's sarcoma, were not detected by polymerase chain reaction in two cases. follow-up information revealed that four patients were alive without disease after wide excision, multiple excision(s), or amputation (one case); three were alive with disease; and two died, one from lymphangiomatosis with respiratory compromise and the other from hemorrhage complicating kasabach-merritt syndrome. it appears that treatment should consist of wide local excision and supportive therapy for associated symptoms.
to define the functions of ncor1 we developed an integrative analysis that combined encode and nci-60 data, followed by in vitro validation. ncor1 and h3k9me3 chip-seq, faire-seq and dna cpg methylation interactions were related to gene expression using bootstrapping approaches. most ncor1 combinations (24/44) were associated with significantly elevated level expression of protein coding genes and only very few combinations related to gene repression. david's biological process annotation revealed that elevated gene expression was uniquely associated with acetylation and ets binding. a matrix of gene and drug interactions built on nci-60 data identified that imatinib significantly targeted the ncor1 governed transcriptome. stable knockdown of ncor1 in k562 cells slowed growth and significantly repressed genes associated with ncor1 cistrome, again, with the go terms acetylation and ets binding, and significantly dampened sensitivity to imatinib-induced erythroid differentiation. mining public microarray data revealed that ncor1-targeted genes were significantly enriched in imatinib response gene signatures in cell lines and chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml) patients. these approaches integrated cistrome, transcriptome and drug sensitivity relationships to reveal that ncor1 function is surprisingly most associated with elevated gene expression, and that these targets, both in cml cell lines and patients, associate with sensitivity to imatinib. lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1, kdm1a) functions as a transcriptional corepressor through demethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (h3k4) but has a coactivator function on some genes through mechanisms that are unclear. we show that lsd1, interacting with corest, associates with and coactivates androgen receptor (ar) on a large fraction of androgen-stimulated genes. a subset of these ar/lsd1-associated enhancer sites have histone 3 threonine 6 phosphorylation (h3t6ph), and these sites are further enriched for androgen-stimulated genes. significantly, despite its coactivator activity, lsd1 still mediates h3k4me2 demethylation at these androgen-stimulated enhancers. foxa1 is also associated with lsd1 at ar-regulated enhancer sites, and a foxa1 interaction with lsd1 enhances binding of both proteins at these sites. these findings show that lsd1 functions broadly as a regulator of ar function, that it maintains a transcriptional repression function at ar-regulated enhancers through h3k4 demethylation, and that it has a distinct ar-linked coactivator function mediated by demethylation of other substrates.
background and objectives the superiority of atypical antipsychotics (also known as second-generation antipsychotics (sgas)) over typical antipsychotics (first generation antipsychotics (fgas)) for negative symptom control in schizophrenic patients is widely debated. the objective of this study was to characterize the time course of the scores of the 3 subscales (positive, negative, general) of the positive and negative syndrome scale (panss) after treatment of patients with antipsychotics, and to compare the control of negative symptom by sgas versus a fga (haloperidol) using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (pkpd) modelling. in addition, to obtain insight in the relationship between the clinical efficacy and the in vitro and in vivo receptor pharmacology profiles, the d2 and 5-ht2a receptor occupancy levels of antipsychotics were related to the effective concentrations.   methods the pkpd model structure developed earlier (part i) was used to quantify the drug effect using the 3 panss subscales. the maximum drug effect sizes (emax) of oral sgas (risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, and paliperidone) across panss subscales were compared with that of haloperidol, while accounting for the placebo effect. using the estimates of pkpd model parameters, the effective concentrations (ceff) needed to achieve 30% reduction in the panss subscales were computed. calculated effective concentrations were then correlated with receptor pharmacology profiles.   results positive symptoms of schizophrenia responded well to all antipsychotics. olanzapine showed a better effect towards negative symptoms than the other sgas and haloperidol. dropout modelling results showed that the probability of a patient dropping out from a trial was associated with all subscales, but was more strongly correlated with the positive subscale than with the negative or the general subscales. our results suggest that different levels of d2 or 5-ht2a receptor occupancy are required to achieve improvement in panss subscales.   conclusions this pkpd modelling approach can be helpful to differentiate the effect of antipsychotics across the different symptom domains of schizophrenia. our analysis revealed that olanzapine seems to be superior in treating the negative symptoms compared to other non-clozapine sgas. the relationship between receptor pharmacology profiles of the antipsychotics and their clinical efficacy is not yet fully understood. background to develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) model using individual-level data of positive and negative syndrome scale (panss) total score to characterize the antipsychotic drug effect taking into account the placebo effect and dropout rate. in addition, a clinical utility (cu) criterion that describes the usefulness of a drug therapy was calculated using the efficacy of the drug and dropout rates.   methods data from 12 clinical trials in schizophrenia patients was used to quantify the effects of the antipsychotic drugs (aps), namely, haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone and paliperidone. compartmental pk models were used to describe the time course of plasma drug concentrations. the combination of an emax and the weibull model was used to describe the drug and placebo effects. the steady-state drug concentrations were assumed to be the drivers of the exposure-response relationship. an exponential model was utilized to identify the predictors of probability of dropout. simulations were performed to check the predictability of the model, and to calculate the cu of the drugs based on panss scores and dropout rates.   results the maximal drug effect (e(max)) was highest for olanzapine whilst it was lowest for ziprasidone. higher observed panss scores resulted in a greater likelihood of dropout. taking into account the efficacy and the drop-out rate, all aps possessed a comparable cu at the therapeutic doses. the resulting pk-pd model parameters were used to compute the effective concentration and dose required to produce a clinically meaningful 30% drop in panss score from the baseline.   conclusions the developed pk-pd model and the associated cu score allow the evaluation of the time course of the panss scores of the different aps and a proper comparison of their clinically relevant treatments effects.
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr), a transcription factor known for mediating xenobiotic toxicity, is expressed in b cells, which are known targets for environmental pollutants. however, it is unclear what the physiological functions of ahr in b cells are. we show here that expression of ahr in b cells is up‐regulated upon b‐cell receptor (bcr) engagement and il‐4 treatment. addition of a natural ligand of ahr, ficz, induces ahr translocation to the nucleus and transcription of the ahr target gene cyp1a1, showing that the ahr pathway is functional in b cells. ahr‐deficient (ahr−/−) b cells proliferate less than ahr‐sufficient (ahr+/+) cells following in vitro bcr stimulation and in vivo adoptive transfer models confirmed that ahr−/− b cells are outcompeted by ahr+/+ cells. transcriptome comparison of ahr‐deficient and ahr‐sufficient b cells identified cyclin o (ccno), a direct target of ahr, as a top candidate affected by ahr deficiency. recent advances in genomics and proteomics, combined with the facilitated generation and analysis of transgenic and gene-knockout animals, have revealed new complexities in classical biological systems, including the b-cell compartment. studies on an 'old', but poorly characterized, b-cell subset — the naive, marginal-zone (mz) b-cell subset — over the past two years have spawned an avalanche of data that encompass the generation and function of these cells. now that the initial 'infatuation' is over, it is time to reconsider these data and generate some conclusions that can be incorporated into a working model of the b-cell system.
the aim of this study was first to examine the effects of 24-h sleep deprivation on apnea index and duration in lambs. the effects on sleep architecture and sigh and swallowing indices were also studied. the impact of postnatal maturation on all measured variables was assessed by studying two different age groups. twelve lambs (six aged 1–2 d and six aged 23–24 d on the day of surgery) were chronically instrumented for polysomnographic recordings including sleep state assessment, nasal flow, diaphragm electromyogram, and glottal constrictor muscle electromyogram. two recordings, one control and one after 24-h sleep deprivation, were performed in all lambs. results show that the effects of sleep deprivation predominate in rapid eye movement sleep in the younger group, with increased rapid eye movement sleep proportion and apnea, sigh, and swallowing index. our results in lambs suggest that the consequences of sleep deprivation upon respiration are predominant early after birth. although the potential relationship of these observations to neonatal apneas and sudden infant death syndrome has yet to be defined, awareness of the effects of sleep deprivation is important for neonatal care. variations in heart rate and respiration rate were found to be responsive to total sleep deprivation, particularly under experimental conditions more realistic to everyday life.
dietary protein restriction in pregnant females reduces offspring birth weight and increases the risk of developing obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. despite these grave consequences, few studies have addressed the effects of preconceptional maternal malnutrition. here we investigate how a preconceptional low-protein (lp) diet affects offspring body mass and insulin-regulated glucose metabolism. ten-week-old female mice (c57bl/6jbom) received either an lp or isocaloric control diet (8% and 22% crude protein, respectively) for 10 weeks before conception, but were thereafter fed standard laboratory chow (22.5% crude protein) during pregnancy, lactation and offspring growth. when the offspring were 10 weeks old, they were subjected to an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (gtt), and sacrificed after a 5-day recovery period to determine visceral organ mass. body mass of lp male offspring was significantly lower at weaning compared with controls. a similar, nonsignificant, tendency was observed for lp female offspring. these differences in body mass disappeared within 1 week after weaning, a consequence of catch-up growth in lp offspring. gtts of 10-week-old offspring revealed enhanced insulin sensitivity in lp offspring of both sexes. no differences were found in body mass, food intake or absolute size of visceral organs of adult offspring. our results indicate that maternal protein restriction imposed before pregnancy produces effects similar to postconceptional malnutrition, namely, low birth weight, catch-up growth and enhanced insulin sensitivity at young adulthood. this could imply an increased risk of offspring developing lifestyle-acquired diseases during adulthood. epidemiological studies have indicated that susceptibility of human adults to hypertension and cardiovascular disease may result from intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight induced by maternal undernutrition. although the 'foetal origins of adult disease' hypothesis has significant relevance to preventative healthcare, the origin and biological mechanisms of foetal programming are largely unknown. here, we investigate the origin, embryonic phenotype and potential maternal mechanisms of programming within an established rat model. maternal low protein diet (lpd) fed during only the preimplantation period of development (0-4.25 days after mating), before return to control diet for the remainder of gestation, induced programming of altered birthweight, postnatal growth rate, hypertension and organ/body-weight ratios in either male or female offspring at up to 12 weeks of age. preimplantation embryos collected from dams after 0-4.25 days of maternal lpd displayed significantly reduced cell numbers, first within the inner cell mass (icm; early blastocyst), and later within both icm and trophectoderm lineages (mid/late blastocyst), apparently induced by a slower rate of cellular proliferation rather than by increased apoptosis. the lpd regimen significantly reduced insulin and essential amino acid levels, and increased glucose levels within maternal serum by day 4 of development. our data indicate that long-term programming of postnatal growth and physiology can be induced irreversibly during the preimplantation period of development by maternal protein undernutrition. further, we propose that the mildly hyperglycaemic and amino acid-depleted maternal environment generated by undernutrition may act as an early mechanism of programming and initiate conditions of 'metabolic stress', restricting early embryonic proliferation and the generation of appropriately sized stem-cell lineages.
this study focused on the response properties underlying selectivity for the rate of frequency modulated (fm) sweeps in the auditory cortex of anesthetized c57bl/6 (c57) mice. linear downward fm sweeps with rates between 0.08 and 20 khz/ms were tested. we show that at least two different response properties predict fm rate selectivity: sideband inhibition and duration tuning. sideband inhibition was determined using the two-tone inhibition paradigm in which excitatory and inhibitory tones were presented with different delays. sideband inhibition was present in the majority (88%, n = 53) of neurons. the spectrotemporal properties of sideband inhibition predicted rate selectivity and exclusion of the sideband from the sweep reduced/eliminated rate tuning. the second property predictive of sweep rate selectivity was duration tuning for tones. theoretically, if a neuron is selective for the duration that a sweep spends in the excitatory frequency tuning curve, then rate selectivity will ensue. duration tuning for excitatory tones was present and predicted rate selectivity in ∼34% of neurons (n = 97). both sideband inhibition and duration tuning predicted rate selectivity equally well, but sideband inhibition was present in a larger percentage of neurons suggesting that it is the dominant mechanism in the c57 mouse auditory cortex. similar mechanisms shape sweep rate selectivity in the auditory system of bats and mice and movement-velocity selectivity in the visual system, suggesting similar solutions to analogous problems across sensory systems. this study provides baseline data on basic spectrotemporal processing in the c57 strain for elucidation of changes that occur in presbycusis. the auditory nerve isoelectric thresholds, in response to tone pigs ranging from 5 to 20 khz, are similar in the young c57bl/6 and cba/j mice, although the latter genotype has somewhat more sensitive responses from 30 to 80 khz. but their behavioral audiograms, obtained by the classical conditioning technique of ehret, are very discrepant. even though the behavioral audiogram of the cba/j mouse can be predicted by measurements from its auditory nerve, the behavioral thresholds of the young c57bl/6 mouse are approximately 40 db less sensitive than its electrophysiological measurements. cochlear hair cell loss was not evident in young mice of either genotype. as the cba/j approaches the end of its predicted life span, its auditory anatomy, physiology and behavior are not significantly altered; but those rare individuals, who exceed their predicted life span by 40% finally develop hearing loss of a mixed nature. by contrast, the c57bl/6 mouse shows a relatively rapid decline of hearing as it ages. by 200 days of age, its auditory nerve responses are 30 db less sensitive at 5 khz, and 55 db less sensitive at 30 khz, than similar measures taken at adolescence. over this same age span, its behavioral sensitivity has only declined by 15 and 25 db at these two frequencies. hair cell counts correlated poorly with both behavioral and electrophysiological auditory measures in the c57bl/6 mouse.
abstract improvements in early diagnosis and treatment strategies in cancer patients have enabled younger women with cancer to survive. in addition to the stressful event of the diagnosis, patients with malignant diseases face the potential loss of the opportunity to have children. preservation of fertility has become a challenging issue and it is still surrounded by controversies. on the basis of available evidence, a group of experts reached a consensus regarding the options for trying to preserve fertility in women with cancer: among established methods, in postpubertal women, oocyte cryopreservation is the preferred option, whereas ovarian tissue cryopreservation is the only possibility for prepubertal girls. combining several strategies on an individual basis may improve the chances of success. realistic information should be provided before any intervention is initiated. counseling should offer support for patients and provide better care by understanding emotional needs, psychological predictors of distress and methods of coping. early referral to the fertility specialist is essential as fertility preservation (fp) may improve quality of life in these patients. the information summarized here is intended to help specialists involved in the treatment of cancer and reproductive medicine to improve their understanding of procedures available for fp in young cancer patients. several lines of evidence demonstrate that the biology, genetics and environment of childhood solid tumours (csts) sets them apart from adult solid tumours. the nature of the progenitor cells from which these tumours arise, and their immature tissue environment, allows csts to develop with fewer defects in cell regulatory processes than adult cancers. these differences could explain why csts are more susceptible to therapeutic intervention than adult tumours. how does the aetiology of these cancers differ from those occurring in adults and how might this affect the development of more effective therapies?
the demand for natural antioxidant active packaging is increasing due to its unquestionable advantages compared with the addition of antioxidants directly to the food. therefore, the search for antioxidants perceived as natural, namely those that naturally occur in herbs and spices, is a field attracting great interest. in line with this, in the last few years, natural antioxidants such as α-tocopherol, caffeic acid, catechin, quercetin, carvacrol and plant extracts (e.g. rosemary extract) have been incorporated into food packaging. on the other hand, consumers and the food industry are also interested in active biodegradable/compostable packaging and edible films to reduce environmental impact, minimise food loss and minimise contaminants from industrial production and reutilisation by-products. the present review focuses on the natural antioxidants already applied in active food packaging, and it reviews the methods used to determine the oxidation protection effect of antioxidant active films and the methods used to quantify natural antioxidants in food matrices or food simulants. lastly consumers’ demands and industry trends are also addressed. this research was aimed at evaluating the inhibition of oxidative changes of beef patties packaged in modified atmosphere (70% o(2)+20% co(2)+10% n(2)) by natural antioxidants: ascorbic acid (500 ppm), taurine (50 mm), carnosine (50 mm), rosemary powder (1000 ppm) and their combinations with the first. beef patties stored at 2±1°c for 20 days were evaluated for colour (l*, a*, b*, c* and h*), tbars, metmyoglobin formation (% of total myoglobin), psychrotrophic microbial counts and sensory odour and discolouration. rosemary, either alone or with ascorbic acid, was highly effective in inhibiting both metmyoglobin formation and lipid oxidation; sensory analysis was in agreement with these results. ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid+taurine and ascorbic acid+carnosine treatments showed a limited inhibitory effect of myoglobin oxidation, while carnosine and carnosine+ascorbic acid were effective in inhibiting lipid oxidation. taurine alone failed to exert any antioxidant effect. principal components analysis confirmed these results.
virtual communities have become significant applications for the internet. previous studies usually treated virtual communities as places for people to share and exchange information and did not explain the social value of communities well. this study treated a virtual community as a stage on which people can present themselves to other users while others can see the shows of people to satisfy their social comparison needs. based on social comparison theory, this paper investigated the effects of upward social comparison in virtual communities on user satisfaction through the mediations of perceived inspiration and self-improvement. furthermore, these effects were moderated by individual social comparison orientation. the results of this study should enhance the understanding of the nature and the social value of information in virtual communities. hypotheses involving mediation are common in the behavioral sciences. mediation exists when a predictor affects a dependent variable indirectly through at least one intervening variable, or mediator. methods to assess mediation involving multiple simultaneous mediators have received little attention in the methodological literature despite a clear need. we provide an overview of simple and multiple mediation and explore three approaches that can be used to investigate indirect processes, as well as methods for contrasting two or more mediators within a single model. we present an illustrative example, assessing and contrasting potential mediators of the relationship between the helpfulness of socialization agents and job satisfaction. we also provide sas and spss macros, as well as mplus and lisrel syntax, to facilitate the use of these methods in applications.
epigenetic modifications of histones have been implicated in the regulation of cell specific expression of genes required for neuronal development. the best studied post-translational (epigenetic) modification of histones is the process of reversible acetylation. two types of enzymes - histone acetyltransferases (hats) and histone deacetylases (hdacs) establish and maintain specific patterns of histone acetylation in balance, thereby contributing to both transcriptional activation and repression of specific sets of genes. histone deacetylases catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from selected lysine residues in the conserved tails of core histone proteins and are considered as transcriptional corepressors. a significant amount of data implicates hdacs in diverse biological processes, including tissue specific developmental program by silencing specific growth-inhibitory genes. in line with this, gene disruption studies have shown that the class i deacetylases, hdac1 and hdac2 play an essential role in nervous system development. in the present review, we briefly highlight current insights supporting the function of histone deacetylases in rodent brain development and discuss present knowledge referring to their role in neurogenesis, taking into consideration results obtained in culture systems and in in vivo studies. histone deacetylases (hdacs) modulate chromatin structure and transcription, but little is known about their function in mammalian development. hdac1 was implicated previously in the repression of genes required for cell proliferation and differentiation. here we show that targeted disruption of both hdac1 alleles results in embryonic lethality before e10.5 due to severe proliferation defects and retardation in development. hdac1‐deficient embryonic stem cells show reduced proliferation rates, which correlate with decreased cyclin‐associated kinase activities and elevated levels of the cyclin‐dependent kinase inhibitors p21waf1/cip1 and p27kip1. similarly, expression of p21 and p27 is up‐regulated in hdac1‐null embryos. in addition, loss of hdac1 leads to significantly reduced overall deacetylase activity, hyperacetylation of a subset of histones h3 and h4 and concomitant changes in other histone modifications. the expression of hdac2 and hdac3 is induced in hdac1‐deficient cells, but cannot compensate for loss of the enzyme, suggesting a unique function for hdac1. our study provides the first evidence that a histone deacetylase is essential for unrestricted cell proliferation by repressing the expression of selective cell cycle inhibitors.
the efficacy of all major insecticide classes continues to be eroded by the development of resistance mediated, in part, by selection of alleles encoding insecticide insensitive target proteins. the discovery of new insecticide classes acting at novel protein binding sites is therefore important for the continued protection of the food supply from insect predators, and of human and animal health from insect borne disease. here we describe a novel class of insecticides (spiroindolines) encompassing molecules that combine excellent activity against major agricultural pest species with low mammalian toxicity. we confidently assign the vesicular acetylcholine transporter as the molecular target of spiroindolines through the combination of molecular genetics in model organisms with a pharmacological approach in insect tissues. the vesicular acetylcholine transporter can now be added to the list of validated insecticide targets in the acetylcholine signalling pathway and we anticipate that this will lead to the discovery of novel molecules useful in sustaining agriculture. in addition to their potential as insecticides and nematocides, spiroindolines represent the only other class of chemical ligands for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter since those based on the discovery of vesamicol over 40 years ago, and as such, have potential to provide more selective tools for pet imaging in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease. they also provide novel biochemical tools for studies of the function of this protein family. the past 30 years have witnessed a period of significant expansion in the use of halogenated compounds in the field of agrochemical research and development. the introduction of halogens into active ingredients has become an important concept in the quest for a modern agrochemical with optimal efficacy, environmental safety, user friendliness and economic viability. outstanding progress has been made, especially in synthetic methods for particular halogen-substituted key intermediates that were previously prohibitively expensive. interestingly, there has been a rise in the number of commercial products containing 'mixed' halogens, e.g. one or more fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atoms in addition to one or more further halogen atoms. extrapolation of the current trend indicates that a definite growth is to be expected in fluorine-substituted agrochemicals throughout the twenty-first century. a number of these recently developed agrochemical candidates containing halogen substituents represent novel classes of chemical compounds with new modes of action. however, the complex structure-activity relationships associated with biologically active molecules mean that the introduction of halogens can lead to either an increase or a decrease in the efficacy of a compound, depending on its changed mode of action, physicochemical properties, target interaction or metabolic susceptibility and transformation. in spite of modern design concepts, it is still difficult to predict the sites in a molecule at which halogen substitution will result in optimal desired effects. this review describes comprehensively the successful utilisation of halogens and their unique role in the design of modern agrochemicals, exemplified by various commercial products from bayer cropscience coming from different agrochemical areas.
the fanconi anemia (fa) protein network is necessary for repair of dna interstrand crosslinks (icls), but its control mechanism remains unclear. here we show that the network is regulated by a ubiquitin signaling cascade initiated by rnf8 and its partner, ubc13, and mediated by faap20, a component of the fa core complex. faap20 preferentially binds the ubiquitin product of rnf8-ubc13, and this ubiquitin-binding activity and rnf8-ubc13 are both required for recruitment of faap20 to icls. both rnf8 and faap20 are required for recruitment of fa core complex and fancd2 to icls, whereas rnf168 can modulate efficiency of the recruitment. rnf8 and faap20 are needed for efficient fancd2 monoubiquitination, a key step of the fa network; rnf8 and the fa core complex work in the same pathway to promote cellular resistance to icls. thus, the rnf8-faap20 ubiquitin cascade is critical for recruiting fa core complex to icls and for normal function of the fa network. cells from fanconi anemia (fa) patients are extremely sensitive to dna interstrand crosslinking (icl) agents, but the molecular basis of the hypersensitivity remains to be explored. fancm (fa complementation group m), and its binding partner, faap24, anchor the multisubunit fa core complex to chromatin after dna damage and may contribute to icl-specific cellular response. here we show that the fancm/faap24 complex is specifically required for the recruitment of replication protein a (rpa) to icl-stalled replication forks. icl-induced rpa foci formation requires the dna-binding activity of faap24 but not the dna translocase activity of fancm. furthermore, fancm/faap24-dependent rpa foci formation is required for efficient atr-mediated checkpoint activation in response to icl. therefore, we propose that fancm/faap24 plays a role in icl-induced checkpoint activation through regulating rpa recruiment at icl-stalled replication forks.
rickettsia conorii, an obligate intracellular tick‐borne pathogen and the causative agent of mediterranean spotted fever, binds to and invades non‐phagocytic mammalian cells. previous work identified ku70 as a mammalian receptor involved in the invasion process and identified the rickettsial autotransporter protein, rompb, as a ligand; however, little is known about the role of ku70–rompb interactions in the bacterial invasion process. using an escherichia coli heterologous expression system, we show here that rompb mediates attachment to mammalian cells and entry in a ku70‐dependent process. a purified recombinant peptide corresponding to the rompb passenger domain interacts with ku70 and serves as a competitive inhibitor of adherence. we observe that rompb‐mediated infection culminates in actin recruitment at the bacterial foci, and that this entry process relies in part on actin polymerization likely imparted through protein tyrosine kinase and phosphoinositide 3‐kinase‐dependent activities and microtubule stability. small‐interfering rna studies targeting components of the endocytic pathway reveal that entry by rompb is dependent on c‐cbl, clathrin and caveolin‐2. together, these results illustrate that rompb is sufficient to mediate ku70‐dependent invasion of mammalian cells and that clathrin‐ and caveolin‐dependent endocytic events likely contribute to the internalization process. increasing evidence indicates that pathogens have evolved highly efficient strategies to induce their internalization within host cells. viruses and bacteria express and expose on their surface, molecules that mimic endogenous ligands to cell receptors, thereby inducing specific intracellular signalling cascades. more recently it has become clear that, as most viruses, bacteria can enter cells via the clathrin‐mediated pathway, indicating a key role for endocytosis in pathogens entry into cells. here we review the pathways followed by listeria monocytogenes to enter into non‐phagocytic cells, as a model for the subversion of cellular functions to induce pathogens internalization.
the aim of this review was to systematically review the results and quality of studies investigating the moderators of school-based interventions aimed at energy balance-related behaviors. we systematically searched the electronic databases of pubmed, embase, cochrane, psycinfo, eric and sportdiscus. in total 61 articles were included. gender, ethnicity, age, baseline values of outcomes, initial weight status and socioeconomic status were the most frequently studied potential moderators. the moderator with the most convincing evidence was gender. school-based interventions appear to work better for girls than for boys. due to the inconsistent results, many studies reporting non-significant moderating effects, and the moderate methodological quality of most studies, no further consistent results were found. consequently, there is lack of insight into what interventions work for whom. future studies should apply stronger methodology to test moderating effects of important potential target group segmentations. specific interventions included in the review studies that assessed policy or environmental interventions to promote physical activity and/or good nutrition were eligible for inclusion. studies had to describe the intervention to be included. the environment was defined as 'anything and everything outside the person', while environmental strategies were defined as those that involved changing the physical, social-cultural, economic or organisational systems to promote behaviour change. studies that assessed educational strategies at the individual level but focused mainly on environmental strategies were eligible for inclusion. to be included in the review, studies had to report tests of interaction or moderation between the intervention studied and a second independent variable. studies on the effects of media campaigns, determinants research, or individual-level interventions were excluded.
x-ray diffraction imaging is rapidly emerging as a powerful technique by which one can capture the local structure of crystalline materials at the nano- and meso-scale. here, we present investigations of the dynamic structure of epitaxial monodomain bifeo3 thin-films using a novel full-field bragg diffraction imaging modality. by taking advantage of the depth penetration of hard x-rays and their exquisite sensitivity to the atomic structure, we imaged in situ and in operando, the electric field-driven structural responses of buried bifeo3 epitaxial thin-films in micro-capacitor devices, with sub-100 nm lateral resolution. these imaging investigations were carried out at acquisition frame rates that reached up to 20 hz and data transfer rates of 40 mb/s, while accessing diffraction contrast that is sensitive to the entire three-dimensional unit cell configuration. we mined these large datasets for material responses by employing matrix decomposition techniques, such as independent component analysis. we found that this statistical approach allows the extraction of the salient physical properties of the ferroelectric response of the material, such as coercive fields and transient spatiotemporal modulations in their piezoelectric response, and also facilitates their decoupling from extrinsic sources that are instrument specific. using in situ high-resolution synchrotron x-ray scattering, the curie temperature tc has been determined for ultrathin c-axis epitaxial pbtio3 films on conducting substrates (srruo3 on srtio3), with surfaces exposed to a controlled vapor environment. the suppression of tc was relatively small, even for the thinnest film (1.2 nm). we observe that 180 degrees stripe domains do not form, indicating that the depolarizing field is compensated by free charge at both interfaces. this is confirmed by ab initio calculations that find polar ground states in the presence of ionic adsorbates.
astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the brain and they make close contacts with neurons and blood vessels. they respond dynamically to various environmental stimuli and change their morphological and functional properties. both physiological and pathological stimuli can induce versatile changes in astrocytes, as this phenomenon is referred to as ‘astrocytic plasticity’. however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of astrocytic plasticity in response to various stimuli remain elusive, except for the presence of hypertrophy, a conspicuous structural change which is frequently observed in activated or reactive astrocytes. here, we investigated differential characteristics of astrocytic plasticity in a stimulus-dependent manner. strikingly, a stab wound brain injury lead to hypertrophy of astrocytes accompanied by increased gaba expression and tonic gaba release in mouse ca1 hippocampus. in contrast, the mice experiencing enriched environment exhibited astrocytic hypertrophy with enhanced probdnf immunoreactivity but without gaba signal. based on the results, we define probdnf-positive/gaba-negative hypertrophic astrocytes as ‘active’ astrocytes and gaba-positive hypertrophic astrocytes as ‘reactive’ astrocytes, respectively. we propose for the first time that astrocytic probdnf can be a bona fide molecular marker of the active astrocytes, which are distinct from the reactive astrocytes which show hypertrophy but with aberrant gaba. activity-dependent secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) is thought to enhance synaptic plasticity, but the mechanisms controlling extracellular availability and clearance of secreted bdnf are poorly understood. we show that bdnf is secreted in its precursor form (pro-bdnf) and is then cleared from the extracellular space through rapid uptake by nearby astrocytes after θ-burst stimulation in layer ii/iii of cortical slices, a paradigm resulting in long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission. internalization of pro-bdnf occurs via the formation of a complex with the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75 and subsequent clathrin-dependent endocytosis. fluorescence-tagged pro-bdnf and real-time total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in cultured astrocytes is used to monitor single endocytic vesicles in response to the neurotransmitter glutamate. we find that endocytosed pro-bdnf is routed into a fast recycling pathway for subsequent soluble nsf attachment protein receptor–dependent secretion. thus, astrocytes contain an endocytic compartment competent for pro-bdnf recycling, suggesting a specialized form of bidirectional communication between neurons and glia.
background experimental and clinical studies document risks of acid-base balance alterations toward acidosis and hypercapnia during intraperitoneal carbon dioxide insufflation. the aim of this study was to assess the influence of different insufflation pressures on arterial blood gas changes and acid-base alterations during laparoscopic cholecystectomy and immediately postoperatively.   methods thirty patients were randomized to receive either 10 or 15 mmhg insufflation pressure. anesthesia was standardized for both groups. the following parameters of acid-base balance were recorded: ph, pco2, po2, base excess (be), hco3. suitable data were analyzed by the mann-whitney u-test.   results pneumoperitoneum with carbon dioxide caused a decrease in ph toward acidosis that was either respiratory or mixed in origin. there were no statistically significant differences in acid-base balance alterations between the two groups of patients.   conclusions carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum causes alterations of the acid-base balance, mostly of respiratory or mixed type. lowering of the insufflation pressure from 15 to 10 mmhg does not contribute to the elimination of acid-base balance alterations during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. controversy has been raised about the effects of systemic carbon dioxide accumulation versus the intra-abdominal pressure on hemodynamics during laparoscopy. we compared the acid-base and hemodynamic changes during pneumoperitoneum in a randomized cross-over study between co2 and nitrogen gases to test the hypothesis that the co2 absorbed during laparoscopy, rather than the 15 mmhg intra-abdominal pressure created, accounted for these changes. eight adult pigs were anesthetized and ventilated with a fixed minute ventilation. metabolic function was measured from analysis of expired flow by a metabolic measurement cart. after baseline periods, animals were randomized into two groups, for 2 hr of either co2 or nitrogen pneumoperitoneum at 15 mmhg intra-abdominal pressure, followed by 1 hr of recovery. after at least a 48-hr recovery period, the experiment was repeated with the other gas. metabolic data revealed that there was a significant absorption of co2 gas across the peritoneal epithelium during co2 pneumoperitoneum. animals insufflated with co2 gas experienced a 75% increase in pulmonary co2 excretion, with significant acidemia and hypercapnia, whereas there were no acid-base disturbances in those with nitrogen insufflation. oxygen consumption remained essentially unchanged in both groups, even during pneumoperitoneum. co2 pneumoperitoneum was also associated with systemic and pulmonary arterial hypertension and a reduction in stroke volume of up to 15%. pneumoperitoneum alone did not compromise hemodynamics. pneumoperitoneum using co2 gas during laparoscopy resulted in systemic co2 absorption across the peritoneum. this led to acidemia, hypercapnea, and depressed hemodynamics. the intra-abdominal pressure routinely used during laparoscopic surgery did not affect metabolic function, acid-base balance, or hemodynamics in the experimental model.
in the present study, a systematic record of the relative antioxidant activity in two selected medicinal plant species extracts is carried out. findings indicated higher levels of total phenols (220±0.060 mg/g, 60±0.03 mg/g) and flavonoid (132±0.03, 30±0.06 mg/g dry weight of the root tissue) contents in the rhizome extracts of c. longa compared to c. caesia. the percentage of inhibition increases from 10μg/ml till 60 μg/ml and beyond which there is no increased in inhibition. the extend of inhibition by quercetin which is used as standard compound is 84%, c. longa 81.6% and c. caesia 76.24% respectively. plant phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and lignin precursors are important constituents of the human diet. these dietary phytophenolics have been recognized largely as beneficial antioxidants that can scavenge harmful active oxygen species including o(2)(.-), h(2)o(2), .oh, and (1)o(2). here we review our current understanding of the antioxidant and prooxidant actions of phenolics in plant cells. in plant systems, phytophenolics can act as antioxidants by donating electrons to guaiacol-type peroxidases (gupxs) for the detoxification of h(2)o(2) produced under stress conditions. as a result of such enzymatic as well as non-enzymatic antioxidant reactions, phenoxyl radicals are formed as the primary oxidized products. until recently, phenoxyl radicals had been difficult to detect by static electron spin resonance (esr) because they rapidly change to non-radical products. application of zn exerts spin-stabilizing effects on phenoxyl radicals that enables us to analyze the formation and decay kinetics of the radicals. the esr signals of phenoxyl radicals are eliminated by monodehydroascorbate radical (mda) reductase, suggesting that phenoxyl radicals, like the ascorbate radical, are enzymatically recycled to parent phenolics. thus, phenolics in plant cells can form an antioxidant system equivalent to that of ascorbate. in contrast to their antioxidant activity, phytophenolics also have the potential to act as prooxidants under certain conditions. for example, flavonoids and dihydroxycinnamic acids can nick dna via the production of radicals in the presence of cu and o(2). phenoxyl radicals can also initiate lipid peroxidation. recently, al, zn, ca, mg and cd have been found to stimulate phenoxyl radical-induced lipid peroxidation. we discuss the mechanism of phenoxyl radical prooxidant activity in terms of lifetime prolongation by spin-stabilizing agents.
abstract protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) is a multimeric serine/threonine phosphatase that carries out multiple functions. although numerous observations suggest that pp2a plays a major role in downregulation of the mitogen-activated protein (map) kinase pathway, the precise mechanisms are unknown. to clarify the role of pp2a in growth factor (insulin, epidermal growth factor [egf], and insulin-like growth factor 1 [igf-1]) stimulation of the ras/map kinase pathway, simian virus 40 small t antigen was expressed in rat-1 fibroblasts which overexpress insulin receptors. small t antigen is known to specifically inhibit pp2a by binding to the a pp2a regulatory subunit, interfering with the ability of pp2a to bind to its cellular substrates. overexpressed small t protein was coimmunoprecipitated with pp2a and inhibited cellular pp2a activity but did not inhibit protein phosphatase 1 (pp1) activity. insulin, igf-1, and egf stimulation also inhibited pp2a activity. growth factor-stimulated ras, raf-1, map kinase, and mitogen-activated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase kinase (mek) activities were elevated in small-t-antigen-expressing cells. furthermore, shc tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with grb2 were also elevated in small-t-antigen-expressing cells. expression levels of shc, ras, mek, or map kinase and phosphorylation of insulin, egf, and igf-1 receptors were not altered. interestingly, we found that pp2a associated with shc in the basal state and dissociated in response to insulin and egf and that this dissociation was inhibited by 65% in small-t-antigen-expressing cells. in addition, we found that pp2a associates with the phosphotyrosine-binding domain (ptb domain) of shc and that phosphorylation of tyrosine 317 of shc was required for pp2a-shc dissociation. we conclude (i) that pp2a negatively regulates the ras/map kinase pathway by binding to shc, inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation; (ii) that the shc-pp2a association is mediated by the shc ptb domain but the interaction is independent of phosphotyrosine binding, indicating a new molecular function for the ptb domain; (iii) that growth factor stimulation, or small-t-antigen expression, causes dissociation of the pp2a-shc complex, facilitating shc phosphorylation and downstream activations of the ras/map kinase pathway; and (iv) that this defines a new mechanism of small-t-antigen action to promote mitogenesis. we have reported that inhibition of protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) by expression of sv40 small t stimulates the mitogenic map kinase cascade. here, we show that sv40 small t can substitute for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) or serum and stimulate atypical protein kinase c zeta (pkc zeta) activity, resulting in mek activation, cell proliferation and nf-kappab-dependent gene transcriptional activation in cv-1 and nih 3t3 cells. these effects were abrogated by co-expression of kinase-deficient pkc zeta and inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85alpha-p110 by wortmannin, ly294002 and a dominant-negative mutant of p85alpha. in contrast, expression of kinase-inactive erk2 inhibited small t-dependent cell growth but was unable to abolish small t-induced nf-kappab transactivation. our results provide the first in vivo evidence for a critical regulatory role of pp2a in bifunctional pkc zeta signaling pathways controlled by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. constitutive activation of pkc zeta and nf-kappab following inhibition of pp2a supports new mechanisms by which sv40 small t promotes cell growth and transformation. by establishing pp2a as a key player in the response of cells to growth factors and stress signals like tnf-alpha, our findings could explain why pp2a is a primary target utilized during sv40 infection to alter cellular behavior.
we propose a method to analyze family-based samples together with unrelated cases and controls. the method builds on the idea of matched case-control analysis using conditional logistic regression (clr). for each trio within the family, a case (the proband) and matched pseudo-controls are constructed, based upon the transmitted and untransmitted alleles. unrelated controls, matched by genetic ancestry, supplement the sample of pseudo-controls; likewise unrelated cases are also paired with genetically matched controls. within each matched stratum, the case genotype is contrasted with control/pseudo-control genotypes via clr, using a method we call matched-clr (mclr). eigenanalysis of numerous snp genotypes provides a tool for mapping genetic ancestry. the result of such an analysis can be thought of as a multidimensional map, or eigenmap, in which the relative genetic similarities and differences amongst individuals is encoded in the map. once constructed, new individuals can be projected onto the ancestry map based on their genotypes. successful differentiation of individuals of distinct ancestry depends on having a diverse, yet representative sample from which to construct the ancestry map. once samples are well-matched, mclr yields comparable power to competing methods while ensuring excellent control over type i error. association studies using diseased cases and their parents avoid biases due to population stratification, and the transmission/disequilibrium test (tdt) is a popular method of analysis. sample size and power calculations for the tdt method have been reported, but often for the special situation of multiplicative effects of alleles on the genotype relative risks. furthermore, some of the proposed calculations ignore the dependence of transmitted alleles from a pair of heterozygous parents when the effects are not multiplicative, which can lead to erroneous sample size calculations. we demonstrate how to calculate sample size and power for the tdt method for general genotype relative risks. as an alternative to the tdt method, we present likelihood methods for a variety of genotype relative risk models. exact likelihood methods are presented to allow for accurate small‐sample analyses. we demonstrate by numerical comparisons: (1) that the tdt method is inefficient for recessive patterns of relative risks, (2) for alleles that are not rare, falsely assuming a multiplicative model can lead to gross underestimation of the required sample size for the tdt statistic, and (3) for common alleles, if the true genotype relative risks have an approximately dominant pattern, then the tdt method can be grossly inefficient compared to likelihood methods. an alternative likelihood ratio statistic, based on two degrees of freedom, tends to be robust for a wide range of genotype relative risk models. finally, we discuss how to use standard software for conditional logistic regression to accurately assess effects of alleles as well as genotype‐environment interaction. genet. epidemiol. 16:250–260, 1999. © 1999 wiley‐liss, inc.
background long qt syndrome type 2 (lqt2) is the second most common type of all long qt syndromes. it is well-known that trafficking deficient mutant human ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg) proteins are often involved in lqt2. cells respond to misfolded and trafficking-deficient proteins by eliciting the unfolded protein response (upr) and activating transcription factor (atf6) has been identified as a key regulator of the mammalian upr. in this study, we investigated the role of er chaperone proteins (calnexin and calreticulin) in the processing of g572r-herg and e637k-herg mutant proteins. methods pcdna3-wt-herg, pcdna3-g572r-herg and pcdna3-e637k-herg plasmids were transfected into u2os and hek293 cells. confocal microscopy and western blotting were used to analyze subcellular localization and protein expression. interaction between wt or mutant hergs and calnexin/calreticulin was tested by coimmunoprecipitation. to assess the role of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in the degradation of mutant herg proteins, transfected hek293 cells were treated with proteasome inhibitors and their effects on the steady state protein levels of wt and mutant hergs were examined. conclusion our results showed that levels of core-glycosylated immature forms of g572r-herg and e637k-herg in association with calnexin and calreticulin were higher than that in wt-herg. both mutant herg proteins could activate the upr by upregulating levels of active atf6. furthermore, proteasome inhibition increased the levels of core-glycosylated immature forms of wt and mutant hergs. in addition, interaction between mutant hergs and calnexin/calreticulin was stronger after proteasome inhibition, compared to wt-herg. these results suggest that trafficking-deficient g572r-herg and e637k-herg mutant proteins can activate er stress pathways and are targeted to the proteasome for degradation. calnexin and calreticulin play important roles in these processes. a variety of quality control mechanisms operate in the endoplasmic reticulum and in downstream compartments of the secretory pathway to ensure the fidelity and regulation of protein expression during cell life and differentiation. as a rule, only proteins that pass a stringent selection process are transported to their target organelles and compartments. if proper maturation fails, the aberrant products are degraded. quality control improves folding efficiency by retaining proteins in the special folding environment of the endoplasmic reticulum, and it prevents harmful effects that could be caused by the deployment of incompletely folded or assembled proteins.
abstract. mutations of the myosin-va gene (myo5a) cause diluted coat color in mice and are occasionally associated with severe neurological disorders. dilute-opisthotonus (dop) is a spontaneous gene mutation in the rat, and phenotypes of the homozygote (dop/dop) are similar to those of the myo5a-deficient mouse, suggesting that the mutation resides in the rat myo5a gene. to elucidate the molecular basis of the dop mutation, we cloned the rat myo5a cdna from the wild type and the dop/dop. the wild-type rat myo5a cdna contained a 5487-bp orf and showed higher homology with myo5a of the other species than myr6 (myo5b) in the rat. a 141-bp in-frame deletion was detected in the head region in the dop cdna. an intragenic rearrangement consisting of a 306-bp inversion associated with 17-bp and 217-bp deletions were identified in the myo5a gene of the dop genome. this rearrangement involved a 141-bp exon, which was skipped in the dop transcript. the myova protein expression was severely impaired in the dop/dop brain. this is the first report to define the dop mutation as the myo5a gene abnormality in the rat. the mouse dilute (d) locus encodes unconventional myosin-va (myova). mice carrying null alleles of dilute have a lightened coat color and die from a neurological disorder resembling ataxia and opisthotonus within three weeks of birth. immunological and ultrastructural studies suggest that myova is involved in the transport of melanosomes in melanocytes and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in cerebellar purkinje cells. in studies described here, we have used an rt-pcr-based sequencing approach to identify the mutations responsible for 17 viable dilute alleles that vary in their effects on coat color and the nervous system. seven of these mutations mapped to the myova motor domain and are reported here. crystallographic modeling and mutant expression studies were used to predict how these mutations might affect motor domain function and to attempt to correlate these effects with the mutant phenotype.
proper regulation of spermatogonial stem cells (sscs) is crucial for sustaining steady-state spermatogenesis. previous work has identified several paracrine factors involved in this regulation, in particular, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor 2, which promote long-term ssc self-renewal. using a ssc culture system, we have recently reported that wnt5a promotes ssc self-renewal through a β-catenin-independent wnt mechanism whereas the β-catenin-dependent wnt pathway is not active in sscs. in contrast, another study has reported that wnt3a promotes ssc self-renewal through the β-catenin-dependent pathway, as it can stimulate the proliferation of a spermatogonia cell line. to reconcile these two contradictory reports, we assessed wnt3a effects on sscs and progenitor cells, rather than a cell line, in vitro. we observed that wnt3a induced β-catenin-dependent signalling in a large subset of germ cells and increased ssc numbers. however, further investigation revealed that cell populations with greater β-catenin-signalling activity contained fewer sscs. the increased maintenance of sscs by wnt3a coincided with more active cell cycling and the formation of germ cell aggregates, or communities, under feeder-free conditions. therefore, the results of this study suggest that wnt3a selectively stimulates proliferation of progenitors that are committed to differentiation or are in the process of exiting the ssc state, leading to enhanced formation of germ cell communities, which indirectly support sscs and act as an in vitro niche. the maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells (sscs) provides the foundation for life-long spermatogenesis. although glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor 2 are crucial for self-renewal of sscs, recent studies have suggested that other growth factors have important roles in controlling ssc fate. because β-catenin-dependent wnt signaling promotes self-renewal of various stem cell types, we hypothesized that this pathway contributes to ssc maintenance. using transgenic reporter mice for β-catenin-dependent signaling, we found that this signaling was not active in sscs in vitro and in most spermatogonia in vivo. nonetheless, a pan-wnt antagonist significantly reduced ssc activity in vitro, suggesting that some wnt molecules exist in our serum-free culture system and contribute to ssc maintenance. here, we report that wnt5a promotes ssc activity. we found that wnt5a-expressing fibroblasts supported ssc activity better than those not expressing wnt5a in culture, and that recombinant wnt5a stimulated ssc maintenance. furthermore, wnt5a promoted ssc survival in the absence of feeder cells, and this effect was abolished by inhibiting the jun n-terminal kinase cascade. in addition, wnt5a blocked β-catenin-dependent signaling. we detected the expression of wnt5a and potential wnt5a receptors in sertoli cells and stem/progenitor spermatogonia, respectively. these results indicate that wnt5a is a cell-extrinsic factor that supports ssc self-renewal through β-catenin-independent mechanisms.
long-term consumption of artificial sweeteners (as) has been the recent focus of safety concerns. however, the potential risk of the as in cardiovascular disease and lipoprotein metabolism has not been investigated sufficiently. we compared the influence of as (aspartame, acesulfame k, and saccharin) and fructose in terms of functional and structural correlations of apolipoprotein (apo) a-i and high-density lipoproteins (hdl), which have atheroprotective effects. long-term treatment of apoa-i with the sweetener at physiological concentration (3 mm for 168 h) resulted in loss of antioxidant and phospholipid binding activities with modification of secondary structure. the as treated apoa-i exhibited proteolytic cleavage to produce 26 kda-fragment. they showed pro-atherogenic properties in acetylated ldl phagocytosis of macrophages. each sweetener alone or sweetener-treated apoa-i caused accelerated senescence in human dermal fibroblasts. these results suggest that long-term consumption of as might accelerate atherosclerosis and senescence via impairment of function and structure of apoa-i and hdl. non-enzymatic glycation of serum apolipoproteins is a main feature of diabetes mellitus under hyperglycemia. advanced glycation end products are implicated in the development of aging and metabolic syndrome, including premature atherosclerosis in diabetic subjects. apoa-i is the principal protein constituent of hdl. in this study, glycated human apoa-i (ga-i) by fructation was characterized on functional and structural correlations in lipid-free and lipid-bound states. the ga-i showed more spontaneous multimeric band formation up to pentamer and exhibited slower elution profile with more degraded fragments from fast protein liquid chromatography. the ga-i showed modified secondary structure from fluorescence and circular dichroism analysis. reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rhdl) containing the ga-i had less content of phospholipid with a much smaller particle size than those of rhdl-containing na-i (na-i-rhdl). the rhdl containing ga-i (ga-i-rhdl) consisted of less molecular number of apoa-i than na-i-rhdl with decreased alpha-helical content. treatment of the ga-i-rhdl induced more atherogenic process in macrophage cell and premature senescence in human dermal fibroblast cell. conclusively, fructose-mediated apoa-i glycation resulted in severe loss of several beneficial functions of apoa-i and hdl regarding anti-senescence and anti-atherosclerosis activities due to a lack of anti-oxidant activity with increased susceptibility of protein degradation and structural modification.
background. chronic eosinophilic inflammation may promote airway remodeling, including thickening of the reticular basement membrane (rbm), hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the airway smooth muscles (asm), and an increase in the production of tenascin. the authors examined the correlation between airway remodeling and bronchial reactivity to histamine (hist) and acetylcholine (ach) in patients with moderate to severe asthma. methods. in 30 adult patients with asthma, the authors assessed bronchial hyperresponsiveness (bhr) to various concentrations of ach and hist by measuring decreases in forced expiratory volume in one second (fev1) of >20% from the preprovocation state, and % recoveries of fev1 after inhalation of β-stimulant. after corticosteroid therapy, the authors evaluated the thickening of rbm and asm and the production of tenascin in bronchial specimens. results. the % decrease in fev1 was correlated with the % recovery in fev1 after provocation by ach or hist. hypertrophy of asm was correlated with the % decrease in fev1 after provocation by hist, but not by ach. thickening of asm, up-regulation of tenascin in rbm, and duration of asthma were inversely correlated with the % recovery of fev1 after provocation by hist, but not by ach. conclusions. in adult patients with moderate to severe asthma, a strong bronchial contraction provoked by hist and a subsequent small recovery indicate airway remodeling. airway inflammation, airflow obstruction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness are characteristic phenotypic features of asthma. clinically, airflow obstruction in asthma often is not fully reversible, and many asthmatic subjects experience an accelerated and progressive loss of lung function over time. histopathologic studies of the asthmatic airway have demonstrated stereotypic changes that might explain the loss of lung function that many patients with asthma experience. the notion of airway remodeling in asthma postulates that the alteration of the structure and function of key airway constituents, including airway smooth muscle, epithelium, blood vessels, and mucus glands, might explain, at least in part, the progressive loss of lung function that is observed clinically. inflammation driven by cd4(+) lymphocytes and mediated by effector cells, particularly the eosinophil, appears to modulate the function of mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, changing the composition of the airway wall matrix. changes in the airway epithelium might alter the function of the underlying smooth muscle and the composition of the matrix and could drive inflammation. alterations in the structure and function of airway smooth muscle change the mechanical properties of the airway wall and might also affect the function of other airway constituents. a variety of experimental models have identified candidate mechanisms and mediators for these observed changes, which are thus potential therapeutic targets. however, clinical studies to date have been disappointing, and it remains to be seen whether targeted therapies will prevent the progressive loss of lung function seen in asthma.
the crista terminalis and eustachian ridge are normal anatomical structures within the right atrium that are not normally looked for or visualised in the standard views obtained while performing a transthoracic echocardiogram (tte). in this case report, the prominent terminal ridge (a normal anatomical variant) appeared as a "mass" in the right atrium that needed to be differentiated from a pathological cardiac mass. identification of physiological structures in the right atrium on tte using additional 3d imaging can avoid unnecessary additional tests that are both more invasive and expensive such as transesophageal echocardiography or mris. we evaluated the diagnostic use of a real-time 3-dimensional (3d) echocardiographic system in 106 patients referred for echocardiography during a 4-month period. real-time 3d echocardiography was performed and recorded in parallel with a routine, comprehensive 2-dimensional (2d) study. the diagnoses were exclusively on the basis of 2d findings. the 3d volumes were sliced offline in the 3 dimensions to selectively display specific cardiac structures and reviewed independent of the 2d findings. the 3d studies were graded as: a, new finding not on 2d studies; b, useful anatomic perspective; c, equivalent to 2d studies; or d, missed 2d findings. compared with 2d echocardiography, 3d echocardiography was graded a in 7 (7%), b in 19 (18%), c in 65 (61%), and d in 15 (14%) cases. in the 26 grade-a and grade-b studies, mitral valve disease and congenital heart disease accounted for 16 (61%) cases. suboptimal image quality was present in 7 (47%) of the 15 grade-d studies. thus, real-time 3d echocardiography yields anatomic information comparable with conventional 2d echocardiography in the majority of patients. it can provide new and useful anatomic insight, particularly in patients with mitral valve disease and congenital heart disease. suboptimal image quality remains a problem for real-time 3d echocardiography in some patients.
background persistence with antimuscarinic therapy in overactive bladder (oab) is poor, but may be different for mirabegron, a β3-adrenoceptor agonist with a different adverse event profile.   objective to compare persistence and adherence with mirabegron versus tolterodine extended release (er) and other antimuscarinics in routine clinical practice over a 12-mo period.   design, setting, and participants retrospective, longitudinal, observational study of anonymised data from the uk clinical practice research datalink gold database. eligibility: age ≥18 yr, ≥1 prescription for target oab drug (between may 1, 2013 and june 29, 2014), and 12-mo continuous enrolment before and after the index prescription date.   interventions mirabegron, darifenacin, fesoterodine, flavoxate, oxybutynin er or immediate-release (ir), propiverine, solifenacin, tolterodine er or ir, and trospium chloride.   outcome measurements and statistical analysis the primary endpoint was persistence (time to discontinuation). secondary endpoints included 12-mo persistence rates and adherence (assessed using medication possession ratio, mpr). cox proportional-hazards regression models and logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounding factors were used to compare cohorts. analyses were repeated after 1:1 matching.   results and limitations the study population included 21996 eligible patients. in the unmatched analysis, the median time-to-discontinuation was significantly longer for mirabegron (169 d, interquartile range [iqr] 41-not reached) compared to tolterodine er (56 d, iqr 28-254; adjusted hazard ratio [hr] 1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.41-1.71; p<0.0001) and other antimuscarinics (range 30-78 d; adjusted hr range 1.24-2.26, p<0.0001 for all comparisons). the 12-mo persistence rates and mpr were also significantly greater with mirabegron than with all the antimuscarinics. limitations include the retrospective design, use of prescription records to estimate outcomes, and inability to capture reasons for discontinuation.   conclusions persistence and adherence were statistically significantly greater with mirabegron than with tolterodine er and other antimuscarinics prescribed for oab in the uk.   patient summary this study assessed persistence and adherence (or compliance) with medications prescribed for oab in a large uk population. we found that patients prescribed mirabegron remained on treatment for longer and showed greater adherence than those prescribed traditional antimuscarinics. study type – symptom prevalence (prospective cohort) level of evidence 1b
the c-jun nh2-terminal kinase (jnk), also known as stress-activated protein kinase, is a mitogen-activated protein kinase that determines cell survival in response to environmental stress. activation of jnk involves redox-sensitive mechanisms and physiological stimuli such as shear stress, the dragging force generated by blood flow over the endothelium. laminar shear stress has antiatherogenic properties and controls structure and function of endothelial cells by mechanisms including production of nitric oxide (no) and superoxide ([formula: see text]). here we show that both no and [formula: see text] are required for activation of jnk by shear stress in endothelial cells. the present study also demonstrates that exposure of endothelial cells to shear stress increases tyrosine nitration, a marker of reactive nitrogen species formation. furthermore, inhibitors or scavengers of no, [formula: see text], or reactive nitrogen species prevented shear-dependent increase in tyrosine nitration and activation of jnk. peroxynitrite alone, added to cells as a bolus or generated over 60 min by 3-morpholinosydnonimine, also activates jnk. these results suggest that reactive nitrogen species, in this case most likely peroxynitrite, act as signaling molecules in the mechanoactivation of jnk. shear stress differentially regulates production of many vasoactive factors at the level of gene expression in endothelial cells that may be mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) and n-terminal jun kinase (jnk). here we show, using bovine aortic endothelial cells (baec), that shear stress differentially regulates erk and jnk by mechanisms involving gi2 and pertussis toxin (ptx)-insensitive g-protein-dependent pathways, respectively. shear activated erk with a rapid, biphasic time course (maximum by 5 min and basal by 30-min shear exposure) and force dependence (minimum and maximum at 1 and 10 dyn/cm2 shear stress, respectively). ptx treatment prevented shear-dependent activation of erk1/2, consistent with a gi-dependent mechanism. in contrast, jnk activity was maximally turned on by a threshold level of shear force (0.5 dyn/cm2 or higher) with a much slower and prolonged time course (requiring at least 30 min to 4 h) than that of erk. also, ptx had no effect on shear-dependent activation of jnk. to further define the shear-sensitive erk and jnk pathways, vectors expressing hemagglutinin epitope-tagged erk (ha-erk) or ha-jnk were co-transfected with other vectors by using adenovirus-polylysine in baec. expression of the mutant αi2(g203), antisense gαi2 and a dominant negative ras (n17ras) prevented shear-dependent activation of ha-erk, while that of αi2(g204) and antisense αi3 did not. expression of a gβ/γ scavenger, the carboxyl terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βark-ct), and n17ras inhibited shear-dependent activation of ha-jnk. treatment of baec with genistein prevented shear-dependent activation of erk and jnk, indicating the essential role of tyrosine kinase(s) in both erk and jnk pathways. these results provide evidence that 1) gi2-protein, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s) are upstream regulators of shear-dependent activation of erk and 2) that shear-dependent activation of jnk is regulated by mechanisms involving gβ/γ, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s).
diet interactions between native and non-native fishes may influence the establishment of native species within their historical range (i.e., reintroduction). therefore, we illustrated the food web structure of and followed the transition of the federally endangered humpback chub gila cypha into a novel food web following translocation and determined the potential for a non-native species, rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss, to influence translocation success. humpback chub and rainbow trout used resources high in the food web and assimilated similar proportions of native fishes, suggesting non-native rainbow trout may occupy an ecological role similar to humpback chub. subsequently, humpback chub may be well suited to colonise tributaries because of their ability to consume resources high in the food web. additionally, diet partitioning may occur between all members of the fish community as indicated by separation in trophic niche space and little trophic overlap; although all species, particularly bluehead sucker catostomus discobolus, used a broad range of food resources. rainbow trout stomach content analysis corroborated stable isotope analysis and suggested rainbow trout diet consisted of aquatic and terrestrial macroinvertebrates, while larger rainbow trout (>120 mm total length) consumed a greater proportion of fish (incidence of piscivory = 5.3%). trophic interactions may reveal an underutilized niche space or biotic resistance to the establishment of translocated native fishes. continued translocation of humpback chub into tributaries appears to be one option for conservation. however, successful establishment of humpback chub may depend on continued removal of non-native trout, increasing availability of diet sources at higher trophic levels. background stable isotope analysis is increasingly being utilised across broad areas of ecology and biology. key to much of this work is the use of mixing models to estimate the proportion of sources contributing to a mixture such as in diet estimation. methodology by accurately reflecting natural variation and uncertainty to generate robust probability estimates of source proportions, the application of bayesian methods to stable isotope mixing models promises to enable researchers to address an array of new questions, and approach current questions with greater insight and honesty. conclusions we outline a framework that builds on recently published bayesian isotopic mixing models and present a new open source r package, siar. the formulation in r will allow for continued and rapid development of this core model into an all-encompassing single analysis suite for stable isotope research.
backgroundstudies on the implementation of clinical practice guidelines (cpg) and particularly its effect on breast cancer (brc) survival on a population-level are scant. this population-based high resolution study from germany aims at providing data on the usage of brc treatment, the extent of adherence to cpg and, as a novelty, survival of brc patients according to major recommended treatment options.methodsdata from the saarland cancer registry including women diagnosed with invasive brc without distant metastasis and followed up between 2000 and 2009 were used. provision of cancer care according to major treatment options is presented by age, clinical subtypes of brc, and over time. conventional and modeled period analysis was used to derive estimates of most up-to-date 5-year relative survival (rs) and the effect of non-adherence to cpg on relative excess risk of death (rer).resultsthe study revealed increasing guideline adherence, with high levels already seen for local treatment (e.g. 67% of the brc patients in 2008/09 received breast conserving surgery), and substantial progress since the millennium change with regard to sentinel node dissection (snd) and adjuvant systemic treatments (e.g. snd and chemotherapy provided to 62% of all patients and 79% of the patients with nodal positive or hormone receptor negative brc in 2008/09, respectively). it further demonstrated increased cancer related mortality among patients without guideline compliant cancer treatment (e.g. patients with nodal positive and hormone receptor negative brc who were not treated with chemotherapy had a 5-year rs of 29% (rer: 2.89, 95% ci: 1.46–5.71) compared to 54% for patients obtaining chemotherapy).conclusionsthis study provides data on the implementation of cpg in a highly developed european country and extends available population-based survival data of brc patients and may provide evidence of increased cancer related excess mortality, if brc patients do not receive guideline compatible treatment. evidence suggests that compared to younger women, older women are less likely to receive standard management for breast cancer. whether this disparity persists once differences in tumour characteristics have been adjusted for has not been investigated in the uk. a retrospective cohort study involving case note review was undertaken, based on the north western cancer registry database of women aged ⩾65 years, resident in greater manchester with invasive breast cancer registered over a 1-year period (n=480). adjusting for tumour characteristics associated with age by logistic regression analyses, older women were less likely to receive standard management than younger women for all indicators investigated. compared to women aged 65–69 years, women aged ⩾80 years with operable (stage 1–3a) breast cancer have increased odds of not receiving triple assessment (or=5.5, 95% confidence interval (ci): 2.1–14.5), not receiving primary surgery (or=43.0, 95% ci: 9.7–191.3), not undergoing axillary node surgery (or=27.6, 95% ci: 5.6–135.9) and not undergoing tests for steroid receptors (or=3.0, 95% ci: 1.7–5.5). women aged 75–79 years have increased odds of not receiving radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery compared to women aged 65–69 years (or=11.0, 95% ci: 2.0–61.6). these results demonstrate that older women in the uk are less likely to receive standard management for breast cancer, compared to younger women and this disparity cannot be explained by differences in tumour characteristics.
background the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (gip) and the glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) receptors are considered complementary therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes. using recombinant membrane-tethered ligand (mtl) technology, the present study focused on defining optimized modulators of these receptors, as well as exploring how local anchoring influences soluble peptide function. methodology/principal findings serial substitution of residue 7 in membrane-tethered gip (tgip) led to a wide range of activities at the gip receptor, with [g7]tgip showing enhanced efficacy compared to the wild type construct. in contrast, introduction of g7 into the related ligands, tglp-1 and tethered exendin-4 (texe4), did not affect signaling at the cognate glp-1 receptor. both soluble and tethered gip and glp-1 were selective activators of their respective receptors. although soluble exe4 is highly selective for the glp-1 receptor, unexpectedly, tethered exe4 was found to be a potent activator of both the glp-1 and gip receptors. diverging from the pharmacological properties of soluble and tethered gip, the newly identified gip-r agonists, (i.e. [g7]tgip and texe4) failed to trigger cognate receptor endocytosis. in an attempt to recapitulate the dual agonism observed with texe4, we conjugated soluble exe4 to a lipid moiety. not only did this soluble peptide activate both the glp-1 and gip receptors but, when added to receptor expressing cells, the activity persists despite serial washes. conclusions these findings suggest that conversion of a recombinant mtl to a soluble membrane anchored equivalent offers a means to prolong ligand function, as well as to design agonists that can simultaneously act on more than one therapeutic target. g-protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) represent the largest constellation of validated drug targets. crystal structures of class a gpcrs have facilitated major advances in understanding the principles underlying gpcr activation. by contrast, relatively little is known about class b gpcrs, a family of receptors for a variety of therapeutically relevant peptide hormones. encouraging progress has recently been made through the structural elucidation of several extracellular hormone-binding domains of class b gpcrs in complex with their natural ligands or synthetic analogues. the structures reveal similar modes of ligand binding, with concomitant alpha-helical structuring of the ligand. the latter suggests an attractive mechanical model for class b gpcr activation.
somatosensory information, conveyed through the gracilis nucleus (gn), is regulated by descending corticofugal (cf) glutamatergic fibers. in addition, the gn receives cholinergic inputs with still unclear source and functional significance. using both the in vitro slice and intracellular recording with sharp and patch electrodes and in vivo extracellular single-unit recordings, we analyzed the effects of activation of cholinergic receptors on synaptic, intrinsic, and functional properties of rat gn neurons. the cholinergic agonist carbamilcholine-chloride [carbachol (cch); 1–10 μm] in vitro (1) induced presynaptic inhibition of epsps evoked by both dorsal column and cf stimulation, (2) increased postsynaptic excitability, and (3) amplified the spike output of gn neurons. the inhibition by atropine (1 μm) and pirenzepine (10 μm) of all presynaptic and postsynaptic effects of cch suggests actions through muscarinic m1 receptors. the above effects were insensitive to nicotinic antagonists. we searched the anatomical origin of the cholinergic projection to the gn throughout the hindbrain and forebrain, and we found that the cholinergic fibers originated mainly in the pontine reticular nucleus (prn). electrical stimulation of the prn amplified sensory responses in the gn in vivo, an effect prevented by topical application of atropine. our results demonstrate for the first time that cholinergic agonists induce both presynaptic and postsynaptic effects on gn neurons and suggest an important regulatory action of inputs from cholinergic neuronal groups in the pontine reticular formation in the functional control of somatosensory information flow in the gn. the functional properties, ionic basis, and possible convergence and interaction of postsynaptic actions mediated by muscarinic and alpha 1- adrenergic receptors were examined in cat and guinea pig dorsal lateral geniculate (lgnd) neurons maintained in thalamic slices in vitro. the possible involvement of gtp-binding proteins was also examined. extracellular recordings from cat lgnd revealed the presence of two subpopulations of neurons. the most prevalent generated rhythmic high- frequency (300–500 hz) bursts of two to six action potentials each, with an interburst frequency of 1–3 hz. intracellular recordings revealed that this activity is typical of thalamocortical relay cells in the apparent absence of neuromodulatory input. application of ach or noradrenaline (na) to rhythmically oscillating neurons in the cat lgnd resulted in cessation of this activity followed by the appearance of single spike firing. intracellular recordings revealed that this change in firing mode was associated with a depolarization of the neuron out of the range of intrinsic rhythmic oscillation and into or near the single spike firing mode. the voltage characteristics of the current underlying the cholinergic and noradrenergic slow depolarization were investigated in guinea pig lgnd neurons. application of the muscarinic agonist acetyl-beta-methylcholine (mch) to presumed relay neurons resulted in a hyperpolarization due to the activation of an outward k+ current. this response was followed by a slow depolarization due to reduction of a relatively non-voltage-dependent potassium current distinct from im and iahp. application of na resulted in a slow depolarization that was also associated with reduction of this relatively linear k+ current. the mch- and na-induced slow depolarizations displayed the property of occlusion, indicating convergence of action. however, these responses were mediated by pharmacologically distinct receptors since the mch-induced reduction in k+ current was blocked by scopolamine while that induced by na was blocked by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. intracellular diffusion of gtp-gamma-s resulted in the inward current responses to na and mch being irreversible, suggesting the possible involvement of a g- protein. prior exposure to pertussis toxin did not affect the inward current response to na and mch, while the outward k+ current responses induced by application of mch or the gabab agonist baclofen were blocked. these results reveal that activation of muscarinic or alpha 1- adrenergic postsynaptic receptors in the lgnd result in a shift in firing mode from rhythmic oscillation to tonic single spike activity through a decrease in a relatively linear k+ current mediated through a pertussis toxin-insensitive g-protein.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
alterations in the inhibitory circuitry of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlpfc) in schizophrenia include reduced expression of the messenger rna (mrna) for somatostatin (sst), a neuropeptide present in a subpopulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) neurons. however, neither the cellular substrate nor the causal mechanisms for decreased sst mrna levels in schizophrenia are known. we used in situ hybridization to quantify the compartmental, laminar, and cellular levels of sst mrna expression in the dlpfc of 23 pairs of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and control subjects. we also explored potential causal mechanisms by utilizing similar methods to analyze sst mrna expression in 2 animal models. the expression of sst mrna was significantly decreased in layers 2-superficial 6 of subjects with schizophrenia, but not in layer 1, deep 6 or the white matter. at the cellular level, both the density of cortical sst mrna-positive neurons and the expression of sst mrna per neuron were reduced in the subjects with schizophrenia. these alterations were not due to potential confounds and appeared to be a downstream consequence of impaired neurotrophin signaling through the trkb receptor. these findings support the hypothesis that a marked reduction in sst mrna expression in a subset of gaba neurons contributes to dlpfc dysfunction in schizophrenia. background markers of gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) neurotransmission seem to be altered in the prefrontal cortex (pfc) of subjects with schizophrenia. we sought to determine whether the expression of the messenger rna (mrna) for the synthesizing enzyme of gaba, glutamic acid decarboxylase67 (gad67), is decreased in the pfc of subjects with schizophrenia, whether this change is present in all or only some gaba neurons, and whether long-term treatment with haloperidol decanoate contributes to altered gad67 mrna expression.   methods tissue sections from 10 pairs of subjects with schizophrenia and control subjects and 4 pairs of haloperidol-treated and control monkeys were processed for in situ hybridization histochemical analysis with sulfur-35-labeled oligonucleotide probes for gad67 mrna and exposed to nuclear emulsion. within each layer of pfc area 9, neurons expressing a detectable level of gad67 mrna were quantified for cell density and the relative level of mrna expression per cell (grain density per neuron).   results in subjects with schizophrenia, the density of labeled neurons was significantly (p<.05) decreased by 25% to 35% in cortical layers 3 to 5. in contrast, the mean grain density per labeled neuron did not differ across subject groups. similar analyses in monkeys revealed no effect of long-term haloperidol treatment on either the density of the labeled neurons or the grain density per labeled neuron.   conclusions these findings indicate that in subjects with schizophrenia, gad67 mrna expression is relatively unaltered in most pfc gaba neurons but is reduced below a detectable level in a subset of gaba neurons. altered gaba neurotransmission in this subset may contribute to pfc dysfunction in subjects with schizophrenia.
two single nucleotide polymorphisms of pdlim5, rs7690296 and rs11097431, were genotyped using mass-array snp genotyping by sequenom technology in 244 bipolar disorder patients, 471 schizophrenia patients, and 601 control individuals who were malay, chinese, and indian ethnic groups in the malaysian population. a significant association was observed in allele frequency between the rs7690296 polymorphism and bipolar disorder in the indian ethnic group [p=0.02, adjusted odds ratio (or) 0.058, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.36–0.93]. a significant association was also observed between the rs7690296 polymorphism and schizophrenia under the recessive model for both malay (p=0.02, adjusted or 1.86, 95% ci 1.12–3.10) and indian (p=0.02, adjusted or 1.92, 95% ci 1.10–3.37) ethnic groups. however, no association was detected between the rs11097431 polymorphism either with bipolar disorder or with schizophrenia. therefore, it can be deduced that the nonsynonymous rs7690296 polymorphism could play an important role in the pathophysiology of both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. single-point mutation in genome, for example, single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) or rare genetic mutation, is the change of a single nucleotide for another in the genome sequence. some of them will produce an amino acid substitution in the corresponding protein sequence (missense mutations); others will not. this paper focuses on genetic mutations resulting in a change in the amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein and how to assess their effects on protein wild-type characteristics. the existing methods and approaches for predicting the effects of mutation on protein stability, structure, and dynamics are outlined and discussed with respect to their underlying principles. available resources, either as stand-alone applications or webservers, are pointed out as well. it is emphasized that understanding the molecular mechanisms behind these effects due to these missense mutations is of critical importance for detecting disease-causing mutations. the paper provides several examples of the application of 3d structure-based methods to model the effects of protein stability and protein-protein interactions caused by missense mutations as well.
while the abrupt climate events of the last deglaciation are well defined in ice core records from the polar regions of both hemispheres, their manifestation elsewhere is less well constrained. here we compile 104 high-resolution paleoclimate records to characterize the timing and spatial pattern of climate change during the last deglaciation. this compilation indicates relatively concurrent timing of the last glacial maximum (lgm; peak glacial conditions) and the altithermal (peak interglacial conditions) in the northern (22.1 � 4.3 ka and 8.0 � 3.2 ka) and southern (22.3 � 3.6 ka and 7.4 � 3.7 ka) hemispheres, suggesting the hemispheres were synchronized by greenhouse gases, local insolation, and/or northern hemisphere induced ocean circulation changes. the magnitude of the glacialeinterglacial temperature change increases with latitude, reflecting the polar amplification of climate change, with a likely minimum global mean cooling of ww4.9 � c during the lgm relative to the altithermal. empirical orthogonal function (eof) analysis of 71 records spanning 19e11 ka indicates that two modes explain 72% of deglacial climate variability. eof1 (61% of variance) shows a globally near-uniform pattern, with its principal component (pc1) strongly correlated with changes in atmospheric co2 .e of2 (11% of variance) exhibits a bipolar seesaw pattern between the hemispheres, with its principal component (pc2) resembling changes in atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength. eof analysis of 90 records from 15 to 11 ka indicates that northern and southern modes of climate variability characterize the younger dryas-bolling/allerod interval. these modes dominate at the higher latitudes of each hemisphere and exhibit a complex interaction in the tropics. the magnitude of the younger dryas climate anomaly (cooler/drier) increases with latitude in the northern hemisphere, with an opposite pattern (warmer/ wetter) in the southern hemisphere reflecting a general bipolar seesaw climate response. global mean temperature decreased by w0.6 � c during the younger dryas. therefore, our analysis supports the paradigm that while the younger dryas was a period of global climate change, it was not a major global cooling event but rather a manifestation of the bipolar seesaw driven by a reduction in atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength. a sediment core from the western tropical atlantic covering the last 21,000 yr has been analysed for centennial scale reconstruction of sea surface temperature (sst) and ice volume-corrected oxygen isotopic composition of sea water (delta(18)o(ivc-sw)) using mg/ca and delta(18)o of the shallow dwelling planktonic foraminifer globigerinoides ruber (white). at a period between 15.5 and 17.5 kyrbp, the mg/ca sstand delta(18)o(ivc-sw), a proxy for sea surface salinity (sss), reveals a warming of around 2.5 degrees c along with all increase in salinity. a second period of pronounced warming and sss increase occurred between 11.6 and 13.5 kyr bp. within age model uncertainties, both warming intervals were synchronous with air temperature increase over antarctica and ice retreat in the southern south atlantic and terminated with abrupt centennial scale sss decrease and slight sst cooling in conjunction with interglacial reactivation of the meridional overturning circulation (moc). we suggest that during these warm intervals, production of saline and warm water of the north brazil current resulted in pronounced heat and salt accumulation, and was associated with warming in the southern atlantic, southward displacement of the intertropical convergence zone and weakened moc. at the termination of the younger dryas and heinrich event 1, intensification of cross-equatorial heat and salt transport caused centennial scale cooling and freshening of the western tropical atlantic surface water. this study shows that the western tropical atlantic served as a heat and salt reservoir during deglaciation. the sudden release of accumulated heat and salt at the end of younger drays and heinrich event 1 may have contributed to the rapid reinvigoration of the atlantic moc.

uncertainty plays an important role in several navigational computations. navigation typically depends on multiple sources of information, and different navigational systems may operate both in parallel and in combination. the optimal combination of information from different sources must take into account the uncertainty of that information. we distinguish between two types of spatial uncertainty, precision, and reliability. precision is the inverse variance of the probability distribution that describes the information a cue contributes to an organism’s knowledge of its location. reliability is the probability of the cue being correctly identified, or the probability of a cue being related to a target location. we argue that in most environments, precision and reliability are negatively correlated. in case of cue conflict, precision and reliability must be traded off against each other. we offer a quantitative description of optimal behaviour. knowledge of uncertainty is also needed to optimally determine the point where a search should start when an organism has more precise spatial information in one of the spatial dimensions. we show that if there is any cost to travel, it is advantageous to head off to one side of the most likely target location and head toward the target. the magnitude of the optimal offset depends on both travel cost and search cost. many animals regularly return to particular locations such as hives, nests, wintering grounds or cache sites. this ability clearly implies that animals possess information that allows them to find a route from their current location to their goal. however, the nature of this information is, in many cases, unknown. one particularly important issue is whether this information encodes at least some of the geometric relationships among real-world objects, which would meet a strict definition of a cognitive map. are animals sensitive to such geometric relationships? although there is clear evidence that animals can learn vectors that represent a goal location in terms of absolute distance and direction to a landmark, there is little evidence of any ability to extract abstract geometric rules. here we report data demonstrating that the corvid clark's nutcracker (nucifraga columbiana) can learn to find the point halfway between two landmarks that vary in the distance that separates them. this learning is based on a general principle, as the birds correctly find the halfway point when the landmarks are presented with new distances between them. this demonstrates the ability to find a point defined not by the relationship between a goal and a landmark but by the relationship between landmarks. further experiments demonstrate that there were two distinct processes involved in locating the halfway point, the use of directional bearings to find the (hypothetical) line connecting the landmarks and finding the correct place along that line.
this paper discusses general quantitative bounds on the convergence rates of markov chains. it then discusses application of these results to simple slice sampler algorithms. it is explained how, in some cases, very useful quantitative results are available, for large classes of target distributions. a new approach to monte carlo simulations is presented, giving a highly efficient method of simulation for large systems near criticality. the algorithm violates dynamic universality at second-order phase transitions, producing unusually small values of the dynamical critical exponent.
chlamydia trachomatis is a gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen. it is associated with significant human illness, including preventable blindness, reactive arthritis. furthermore, it is the most common agent of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases with potentially serious sequel in women that include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and sterility. as an obligate intracellular pathogen, chlamydia rely on host cell for all aspects of their survival, from the initial attachment with the host cell membranes, to cellular invasion, acquisition of host cell metabolites and intracellular replication. unique and largely uncharacterized intracellular host-pathogen interactions are critical for successful chlamydial infection. despite the prevalence of chlamydia spp. and their role in human disease, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the infection process, the host pathogen interactions, and the intracellular survival and replication of chlamydia. to gain a comprehensive understanding of the disease pathogenesis, it is equally important to understand the contribution of the host as well as the pathogen to these complex host pathogen interactions. therefore in this study i decided to focus on the host factors involved in the chlamydia infections. for this purpose, silencing of gene expression by rna interference (rnai) has proven to be a robust and straight forward technique for gene function analysis in eukaryotic cells. this has become a method of choice for loss of function studies and can serve to unravel the contribution of host cell in the pathogenesis during chlamydia infection. this study aims to obtain deeper insights into infection processes of chlamydia by using rnai based loss-of-function screen of host cell determinants. as a readout chlamydia number and inclusion size for the primary infection as well as quantification of chlamydia progeny (infectivity) were measured to monitor entry, survival and replication of the pathogen within the host. therefore, a screen was performed in 96 well format, analyzing the impact of ~1500 different human genes mainly covering the human kinome, apoptosis as well as trafficking related genes. with help of various robust statistical analysis methods 134 primary hits were selected for further analysis. to rule out possible off-target effects, which are inherent to the current status of rnai technology, the primary hits were further validated using 4 new sirna sequences for each of the identified primary hits. this resulted glucocorticoid-induced tnfr (gitr) has been implicated as an essential regulator of immune responses to self tissues and pathogens. we have recently shown that gitr-induced cellular events promote survival of naive t cells, but are insufficient to protect against activation-induced cell death. however, the molecular mechanisms of gitr-induced signal transduction that influence physiologic and pathologic immune responses are not well understood. tnfr-associated factors (trafs) are pivotal adapter proteins involved in signal transduction pathways of tnfr-related proteins. yeast two-hybrid assays and studies in hek293 cells and primary lymphocytes indicated interactions between traf2 and gitr mediated by acidic residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. gitr-induced activation of nf-κb is blocked by a20, an nf-κb-inducible protein that interacts with trafs and functions in a negative feedback mechanism downstream of other tnfrs. interestingly, in contrast with its effects on signaling triggered by other tnfrs, our functional studies revealed that traf2 plays a novel inhibitory role in gitr-triggered nf-κb activation.
loss of the rna-binding fragile x protein [fragile x mental retardation protein (fmrp)] results in a spectrum of cognitive deficits, the fragile x syndrome (fxs), while aging individuals with decreased protein levels present with a subset of these symptoms and tremor. the broad range of behavioral deficits likely reflects the ubiquitous distribution and multiple functions of the protein. fmrp loss is expected to affect multiple neuronal proteins and intracellular signaling pathways, whose identity and interactions are essential in understanding and ameliorating fxs symptoms. we used heterozygous mutants and targeted rna interference-mediated abrogation in drosophila to uncover molecular pathways affected by fmrp reduction. we present evidence that fmrp loss results in excess metabotropic glutamate receptor (mglur) activity, attributable at least in part to elevation of the protein in affected neurons. using high-resolution behavioral, genetic, and biochemical analyses, we present evidence that excess mglur upon fmrp attenuation is linked to the camp decrement reported in patients and models, and underlies olfactory associative learning and memory deficits. furthermore, our data indicate positive transcriptional regulation of the fly fmr1 gene by camp, via protein kinase a, likely through the transcription factor creb. because the human fmr1 gene also contains creb binding sites, the interaction of mglur excess and camp signaling defects we present suggests novel combinatorial pharmaceutical approaches to symptom amelioration upon fmrp attenuation. this study was designed to further assess cognitive and affective functioning in a mouse model of fragile x syndrome (fxs), the fmr1(tm1cgr) or fmr1 "knockout" (ko) mouse. male ko mice and wild-type littermate controls were tested on learning set and reversal learning tasks. the ko mice were not impaired in associative learning, transfer of learning, or reversal learning, based on measures of learning rate. analyses of videotapes of the reversal learning task revealed that both groups of mice exhibited higher levels of activity and wall-climbing during the initial sessions of the task than during the final sessions, a pattern also seen for trials following an error relative to those following a correct response. notably, the increase in both behavioral measures seen early in the task was significantly more pronounced for the ko mice than for controls, as was the error-induced increase in activity level. this pattern of effects suggests that the ko mice reacted more strongly than controls to the reversal of contingencies and pronounced drop in reinforcement rate, and to errors in general. this pattern of effects is consistent with the heightened emotional reactivity frequently described for humans with fxs.
abstract higher temperatures increase the moisture-holding capacity of the atmosphere and can lead to greater atmospheric demand for evapotranspiration, especially during warmer seasons of the year. increases in precipitation or atmospheric humidity ameliorate this enhanced demand, whereas decreases exacerbate it. in the southwestern united states (southwest), this means the greatest changes in evapotranspirational demand resulting from higher temperatures could occur during the hot–dry foresummer and hot–wet monsoon. here seasonal differences in surface climate observations are examined to determine how temperature and moisture conditions affected evapotranspirational demand during the pronounced southwest droughts of the 1950s and 2000s, the latter likely influenced by warmer temperatures now attributed mostly to the buildup of greenhouse gases. in the hot–dry foresummer during the 2000s drought, much of the southwest experienced significantly warmer temperatures that largely drove greater evapotranspir... american meteorological society | 1423 affiliations: gutzler and ritchie—university of new mexico, albuquerque, new mexico; kim, higgins, mo, schemm, and song—climate prediction center, ncep/nws/noaa, camp springs, maryland; kanamitsu—scripps institution of oceanography, university of california, san diego, la jolla, california; juang, mitchell, and yang—environmental modeling center, ncep/nws/noaa, camp springs, maryland; pegion— global modeling and assimilation office, nasa/gsfc, greenbelt, maryland, and science applications international corporation (saic), beltsville, maryland; schubert—global modeling and assimilation office, nasa/gsfc, greenbelt, maryland *current affiliation: climate prediction division, korea meteorological administration, seoul, korea corresponding author: dr. david s. gutzler, earth and planetary sciences department, university of new mexico msc03-2040, albuquerque, nm 87131 e-mail: gutzler@unm.edu doi:10.1175/bams-86-10-1423
the inclusion of level i in neck dissections for oropharyngeal carcinoma remains controversial. our objectives were to evaluate the feasibility and relevance of substation node counts in level i of the neck dissection and to determine the specific substation location of metastases in level i in oropharyngeal carcinoma. a retrospective review of 333 previously untreated patients from 1965 to 1986, with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or hypopharynx, was undertaken to ascertain the prevalence of neck node metastases by neck level. the 333 patients underwent 344 classical radical neck dissections. patients were grouped by clinical neck status at the time of neck dissection: elective dissection in the no neck (n = 71), and immediate therapeutic dissection in the n+ neck (n = 259). detailed analysis was performed for each group based on the specific primary site. this revealed a predominance of neck node metastases in levels ii, iii, and iv for both oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal primaries. isolated “skip” metastases outside of levels ii, iii, or iv occurred in only 1 patient (0.3%). otherwise, level i or v involvement was always associated with nodal metastases at other levels (ie, n2 disease). these data support the trend toward selective limited neck dissection (anterior modified) in no patients. furthermore, they provide the foundation for planning of future prospective trials to assess the efficacy of modifications in the extent of neck dissection for carcinomas of the oropharynx or hypopharynx.
solutes distribute differentially between leaf tissues and cells. the present study tested the hypothesis that certain solutes are supplied preferentially to the epidermis in the transpiration stream, by-passing mesophyll cells along bundle sheath extensions. using energy dispersive x-ray analysis of extracted cell sap, the distribution of solutes was studied in the emerged zone (transpiring) and the elongation zone (non-transpiring) of the developing leaf three of barley (hordeum vulgare l.). the basic distribution of cl, k, p and ca between epidermis and bulk tissue, and between cells within the epidermis, was similar in the two leaf regions. however, in the emerged zone differences in solute concentrations between tissues and cells were greater. a local reduction in transpiration rate along the emerged portion of the blade specifically prevented ca from accumulating to high levels in epidermal cells close to stomata. it is concluded that differences in solute concentrations between epidermal cells and other leaf tissues can be established in the absence of transpiration, but that they require transpiration for their full expression. peristomatal transpiration appears to be responsible for high ca in interstomatal cells. the concentrations of vacuolar solutes in different cells of the upper epidermis of the third leaf of barley (hordeum vulgare l.) were studied in leaves of different ages grown under different irradiances (120 or 400 μmol photons·m−2·s−1). vacuolar saps were extracted from individual cells located at various positions between adjacent veins and were analysed for their osmolality and the concentrations of k+, ca2+, cl−, no3− and malate. each ion showed a cell-specific distribution within the epidermis that was both quantitatively and qualitatively dependent on the leaf developmental stage and on the light level. during leaf ageing, ca2+ accumulated preferentially in interstomatal cells (i.e. those located between longitudinally adjacent stomata) at concentrations up to 180 mm. under low light conditions, this was accompanied by a more or less equal decrease in k+ concentration. epidermal malate was found only in plants grown continuously or transiently under the high irradiance and reached highest concentrations in trough and interstomatal cells (60 to 150mm). chloride concentration was highest in cells overlying the veins (designated as ridge cells) and lowest in cells located between the veins (trough cells), while no3− exhibited the reverse distribution, although the precise patterns were age-dependent. epidermal osmolality increased with age, but the intercellular differences in the osmolalities were small compared to differences in vacuolar solute composition. a cell-to-cell analysis of the region surrounding the stomata showed that the steepest changes in the vacuolar solute composition of epidermal cells occurred at the boundary between ridge or trough cells and the adjacent near-stomatal cells.
this intracellular study investigates synaptic mechanisms of orientation and direction selectivity in cat area 17. visually evoked inhibition was analyzed in 88 cells by detecting spike suppression, hyperpolarization, and reduction of trial-to-trial variability of membrane potential. in 25 of these cells, inhibition visibility was enhanced by depolarization and spike inactivation and by direct measurement of synaptic conductances. we conclude that excitatory and inhibitory inputs share the tuning preference of spiking output in 60% of cases, whereas inhibition is tuned to a different orientation in 40% of cases. for this latter type of cells, conductance measurements showed that excitation shared either the preference of the spiking output or that of the inhibition. this diversity of input combinations may reflect inhomogeneities in functional intracortical connectivity regulated by correlation-based activity-dependent processes. stimulus-specific response properties, such as direction or orientation selectivity, were studied intracellularly in cells recorded from area 17 of the cat. in all 5 direction selective complex cells and one orientation selective simple cell successfully studied, visually evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (epsps) were tuned to the preferred direction or orientation. visually evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (ipsps) were also tuned to the preferred direction/orientation of stimulus. ipsps evoked by the non-preferred stimulus when present were smaller than those evoked by the preferred stimulus. ipsps were undetected in two of the 5 cells tested. these results suggest that directionally/orientationally tuned epsps make a major contribution to stimulus specificity in visual cortical neurons but ipsps evoked by a stimulus with null-direction/orientation may sharpen the stimulus specificity.
to compare efficacy and safety of new insulin glargine 300 u/ml (gla‐300) with that of insulin glargine 100 u/ml (gla‐100) in japanese adults with type 1 diabetes. objective insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes still provides suboptimal outcomes. insulin glargine 300 units/ml (gla-300), with a flatter pharmacodynamic profile compared with insulin glargine 100 units/ml (gla-100), is an approach to this problem. research design and methods people with type 1 diabetes, using a mealtime and basal insulin regimen, were randomized open-label to gla-300 or gla-100 and to morning or evening injection, continuing the mealtime analog, and followed for 6 months. results participants (n = 549) were a mean age of 47 years and had a mean duration of diabetes of 21 years and bmi of 27.6 kg/m2. the change in hba1c (primary end point; baseline 8.1%) was equivalent in the two treatment groups (difference, 0.04% [95% ci −0.10 to 0.19]) (0.4 mmol/mol [−1.1 to 2.1]), and gla-300 was thus noninferior. similar results with wider 95% cis were found for morning and evening injection times and for prebreakfast self-measured plasma glucose (smpg) overall. results were also similar for gla-300 when morning and evening injection time was compared, including overlapping 8-point smpg profiles. hypoglycemia did not differ, except for the first 8 weeks of the study, when nocturnal confirmed or severe hypoglycemia was lower with gla-300 (rate ratio 0.69 [95% ci 0.53–0.91]). hypoglycemia with gla-300 did not differ by time of injection. the basal insulin dose was somewhat higher at 6 months for gla-300. the adverse event profile did not differ and was independent of the gla-300 time of injection. weight gain was lower with gla-300. conclusions in long-duration type 1 diabetes, gla-300 provides similar glucose control to gla-100, with a lower risk of hypoglycemia after transfer from other insulins, independent of time of injection, and less weight gain.
herein, for the first time, we investigated in vivo efficacy and associated molecular biomarkers and mechanisms of a chemopreventive agent, silibinin, against human colorectal carcinoma (crc) ht29 xenograft growth. nude mice were implanted with ht29 cells and fed with vehicle (carboxymethyl cellulose or phosphatidylcholine) or 200 mg/kg/d dose of silibinin or 100 and 200 mg/kg/d doses of silybin-phytosome (5 days per week) for 32 days. silibinin inhibited tumor growth that accounted for 48% (p = 0.002) decrease in tumor volume and 42% (p = 0.012) decrease in tumor weight at the end of the experiment without any adverse health effect. a stronger antitumor efficacy was observed with silybin-phytosome preparation. silibinin decreased proliferation index by 40% (p < 0.001), increased apoptotic index by approximately 2-fold (p = 0.001), and reduced microvessel density by 36% (p = 0.001) in tumors. antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of silibinin were associated with down-regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (erk1/2) and akt phosphorylation as well as cyclin d1 expression. antiangiogenic effect of silibinin was coupled with a strong decrease in inducible nitric oxide synthase (nos) and nos3, cyclooxygenase-1 (cox-1) and cox-2, and hypoxia-inducing factor-1 alpha (hif-1 alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf). these findings suggest in vivo antitumor efficacy of silibinin against crc involving its antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and antiangiogenic activities. the inhibition of erk1/2 and akt signaling may account for antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects, whereas down-regulation of nos, cox, hif-1 alpha, and vegf expression could lead to antiangiogenic effect of silibinin against crc. overall, potential use of silibinin against human crc could be suggested. endothelium-derived relaxing factor (edrf) is a labile humoral agent which mediates the action of some vasodilators. nitrovasodi-lators, which may act by releasing nitric oxide (no), mimic the effect of edrf and it has recently been suggested by furchgott1 that edrf may be no. we have examined this suggestion by studying the release of edrf and no from endothelial cells in culture. no was determined as the chemiluminescent product of its reaction with ozone2. the biological activity of edrf and of no was measured by bioassay3. the relaxation of the bioassay tissues induced by edrf was indistinguishable from that induced by no. both substances were equally unstable. bradykinin caused concentration-dependent release of no from the cells in amounts sufficient to account for the biological activity of edrf. the relaxations induced by edrf and no were inhibited by haemoglobin and enhanced by superoxide dismutase to a similar degree. thus no released from endothelial cells is indistinguishable from edrf in terms of biological activity, stability, and susceptibility to an inhibitor and to a potentiator. we suggest that edrf and no are identical.
we present a new robust approach to the detection of rail surface disruptions in high-resolution images by means of 21/2d image analysis. the detection results are used to determine the condition of rails as a precaution to avoid breaks and further damage. images of rails are taken with color line scan cameras at high resolution of about 0.2 millimeters under specific illumination to enable 21/2d image analysis. pixel locations fulfilling the anti-correlation property between two color channels are detected and integrated over regions of general background deviations using so called cross-channel co-occurrence matrices, a novel variant of co-occurrence matrices introduced as part of this work. consequently, the detection of rail surface disruptions is achieved with high precision, whereas the unintentional elimination of valid detections in the course of false and irrelevant detection removal is reduced. in this regard, the new approach is more robust than previous methods. we present an approach to high-resolution rail surface analysis combining 2d image texture classification and 21/2d analysis of surface disruptions. detailed analysis of images of rail surfaces is used to observe the condition of rails and, as a precaution, to avoid rail breaks and further damage. single rails are observed by a color line scan camera at high resolution of approximately 0.2 millimeters and under special illumination in order to enable 21/2d image analysis. gabor filter banks are used for 2d texture description and classes are modeled by gaussian mixtures. a bayesian classifier, which also incorporates background knowledge, is used to differentiate between surface texture classes. classes which can be related to surface disruptions are derived from the analysis of the anti-correlation properties between two color channels. images are illuminated by two light sources mounted at different position and operating at different wavelengths. results for data gathered in the vienna metro system are presented.
we investigated visuomotor adaptation using an isometric, target-acquisition task. following trials with no rotation, two participant groups were exposed to a random sequence of 30° clockwise (cw) and 60° counter-clockwise (ccw) rotations, with (dual-cue), or without (dual-no cue), colour cues that enabled each environment (non-rotated, 30° cw and 60° ccw) to be identified. a further three groups experienced only 30° cw trials or only 60° ccw trials (single rotation groups) in which each visuomotor mapping was again associated with a colour cue. during training, all single groups reduced angular deviations of the cursor path during the initial portion of the movements, indicating feedforward adaptation. consistent with the view that the adaptation occurred automatically via recalibration of the visuomotor mapping (krakauer et al. 1999), post-training aftereffects were observed, despite colour cues that indicated that no rotation was present. for the dual-cue group, angular deviations decreased with training in the 60° trials, but were unchanged in the 30° trials, while for the dual-no cue group angular deviations decreased for the 60° cw trials but increased for the 30° cw trials. these results suggest that in a dual adaptation paradigm a colour cue can permit delineation of the two environments, with a subsequent change in behaviour resulting in improved performance in at least one of these environments. increased reaction times within the training block, together with the absence of aftereffects in the post-training period for the dual-cue group suggest an explicit cue-dependent strategy was used in an attempt to compensate for the rotations. the relationship between implicit and explicit processes during motor learning, and for visuomotor adaptation in particular, is poorly understood. we set up a conflict between implicit and explicit processes by instructing subjects to counter a visuomotor rotation using a cognitive strategy in a pointing task. specifically, they were told the exact nature of the directional perturbation, a rotation that directed them 45° counterclockwise from the desired target, and they were instructed to counter it by aiming for the neighboring clockwise target, 45° away. subjects were initially successful in completely negating the rotation with this strategy. surprisingly, however, they were unable to sustain explicit control and made increasingly large errors to the desired target. the cognitive strategy failed because subjects simultaneously adapted unconsciously to the rotation to the neighboring target. notably, the rate of implicit adaptation to the neighboring target was not significantly different from rotation adaptation in the absence of an opposing explicit strategy. these results indicate that explicit strategies cannot substitute for implicit adaptation to a visuomotor rotation and are in fact overridden by the motor planning system. this suggests that the motor system requires that planned and executed trajectories remain congruous in visual space, and enforces this correspondence even at the expense of an opposing explicit task goal.
introductionas an ecological adaptation venoms have evolved independently in several species of metazoa. as haematophagous arthropods ticks are mainly considered as ectoparasites due to directly feeding on the skin of animal hosts. ticks are of major importance since they serve as vectors for several diseases affecting humans and livestock animals. ticks are rarely considered as venomous animals despite that tick saliva contains several protein families present in venomous taxa and that many ixodida genera can induce paralysis and other types of toxicoses. tick saliva was previously proposed as a special kind of venom since tick venom is used for blood feeding that counteracts host defense mechanisms. as a result, the present study provides evidence to reconsider the venomous properties of tick saliva.resultsbased on our extensive literature mining and in silico research, we demonstrate that ticks share several similarities with other venomous taxa. many tick salivary protein families and their previously described functions are homologous to proteins found in scorpion, spider, snake, platypus and bee venoms. this infers that there is a structural and functional convergence between several molecular components in tick saliva and the venoms from other recognized venomous taxa. we also highlight the fact that the immune response against tick saliva and venoms (from recognized venomous taxa) are both dominated by an allergic immunity background. furthermore, by comparing the major molecular components of human saliva, as an example of a non-venomous animal, with that of ticks we find evidence that ticks resemble more venomous than non-venomous animals. finally, we introduce our considerations regarding the evolution of venoms in arachnida.conclusionstaking into account the composition of tick saliva, the venomous functions that ticks have while interacting with their hosts, and the distinguishable differences between human (non-venomous) and tick salivary proteins, we consider that ticks should be referred to as venomous ectoparasites. the tick, ornithodoros savignyi has been implicated in inducing paralysis and tampan toxicosis. in this study, a basic toxin (tsgp4) was identified and the presence of an acidic toxin (tsgp2) was confirmed. both basic and acidic toxins were more lethal than previously described, with tsgp4 (34microg) and tsgp2 (24microg) causing mortality of adult mice within 30min. pathological effects on the cardiac system, notably of salivary gland extract on an isolated rat heart perfusion system and of purified toxins on mouse electrocardiogram patterns could be observed. tsgp4 caused mobitz type ventricular block, while tsgp2 induced ventricular tachycardia. conversely, fractions from reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography preparations caused paralysis-like symptoms of the limbs after only 48h. the toxins also differ from previously described tick paralysis toxins in terms of molecular behavior and properties. these results indicate that tampan toxicoses and tick paralysis are unrelated pathogenic phenomena.
backgroundtemporomandibular joint disorders (tmjd) are multifactor, complex clinical problems affecting approximately 60–70% of the general population, with considerable controversy about the most effective treatment. for example, reports claim success rates of 70% and 83% for non-surgical and surgical treatment, whereas other reports claim success rates of 40% to 70% for self-improvement without treatment. therefore, the purpose of this study was to (1) identify systematic reviews comparing temporomandibular joint disorder surgical and non-surgical treatment, (2) evaluate their methodological quality, and (3) evaluate the evidence grade within the systematic reviews.methodsa search strategy was developed and implemented for medline, cochrane library, lilacs, and brazilian dentistry bibliography databases. inclusion criteria were: systematic reviews (± meta-analysis) comparing surgical and non-surgical tmjd treatment, published in english, spanish, portuguese, italian, or german between the years 1966 and 2007(up to july). exclusion criteria were: in vitro or animal studies; narrative reviews or editorials or editorial letters; and articles published in other languages. two investigators independently selected and evaluated systematic reviews. three different instruments (amstar, oqaq and casp) were used to evaluate methodological quality, and the results averaged. the grade instrument was used to evaluate the evidence grade within the reviews.resultsthe search strategy identified 211 reports; of which 2 were systematic reviews meeting inclusion criteria. the first review met 23.5 ± 6.0% and the second met 77.5 ± 12.8% of the methodological quality criteria (mean ± sd). in these systematic reviews between 9 and 15% of the trials were graded as high quality, and 2 and 8% of the total number of patients were involved in these studies.conclusionthe results indicate that in spite of the widespread impact of tmjd, and the multitude of potential interventions, clinicians have expended sparse attention to systematically implementing clinical trial methodology that would improve validity and reliability of outcome measures. with some 20 years of knowledge of evidence-based healthcare, the meager attention to these issues begins to raise ethical issues about tmjd trial conduct and clinical care. in permanent temporomandibular disc displacement (tmj-dd) outcome studies many authors claim positive effects of arthroscopic surgery, arthrocentesis and physical therapy. this literature review was undertaken to analyse whether the claimed effects are based on acceptable methodology. the recorded papers were analysed by two independent observers according to (1) method of investigation, (2) therapeutic intervention studied, (3) therapeutic outcome variables used, and (4) claimed effectiveness of the intervention. agreement between observers was calculated. twenty-four papers were found in which therapeutic outcome of interventions on temporomandibular disorders were studied. six studies applied a true experimental design. each of these six studies compared a different set of interventions. twenty-two papers used maximal mouth opening (mmo) as an outcome variable, nine studied pain intensity on a visual analogue scale, one paper assessed the mandibular function impairment questionnaire. kappa for overall agreement concerning the reviewing criteria was 0.82 (p < or = 0.001). no distinguishing effects on mmo, pain or function impairment were reported between arthroscopic surgery, arthrocentesis and physical therapy. results of methodological sound outcome studies evaluating the effects of arthroscopic surgery, arthrocentesis and physical therapy are needed.
mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapks) play a pivotal role in the mitogenic signal transduction pathway and are essential components of the mapk cascade, which includes mek (also known as map kinase kinase), raf-1, and ras. in this study, we examined whether constitutive activation of the mapk cascade was associated with the carcinogenesis of human renal cell carcinomas in a series of 25 tumors and in corresponding normal kidneys. constitutive activation of mapks in tumor tissue, as determined by the appearance of phosphorylated forms, was found in 12 cases (48%), and this activation was confirmed by a direct in vitro kinase assay of immunoprecipitate using myelin basic protein as the substrate. the phosphorylation of mek and of raf-1, as monitored by a mobility shift in sds-page, which is reportedly associated with the activation of these kinases, occurred in 9 of 18 cases (50%) and in 6 of 11 cases (55%) respectively. the activation of mapks was correlated with mek activation (p = 0.0045) and with raf-1 activation (p = 0.067). furthermore, overexpression of mek was found in 13 of 25 cases (52%) by western blot analysis, and this overexpression was associated significantly with mapk activation (p = 0.034). no mutations were noted in h-,k-, or n-ras genes by pcr direct sequencing in any of the 25 tumor samples. of the patients studied, 8 of 18 (44%) stage pt2 patients and four of six (67%) stage pt3 patients showed mapk activation. the single stage pt1 patient did not evidence mapk activation. furthermore, one of seven (14%) grade 1 patients, 9 of 13 (69%) grade 2 patients, and two of five (40%) grade 3 patients showed mapk activation (grade 1 versus grades 2 and 3, p = 0.046). our results suggest that constitutive activation of mapks may be associated with the carcinogenesis of human rccs. an explosion of new information linking activation of cell surface signal initiators to changes in gene expression has recently emerged. the focus of much of this information has centered around the agonist-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein (map) kinases. although this intracellular signal transduction pathway is extremely complex, conservation of many of its components has been observed in yeast, nematodes, drosophila, and mammals. thus, these signaling proteins may participate in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes.
lymphangioleiomyomatosis (lam) is a rare disease leading to lungs cysts and progressive respiratory failure. cells of unknown origin accumulate in the lungs forming nodules and eventually resulting in lung cysts. these lam cells are described as clonal with bi-allelic mutations in tsc-2 resulting in constitutive mtor activation. however lam nodules are heterogeneous structures containing cells of different phenotypes; we investigated whether recruited wild type cells were also present alongside mutation bearing cells. cells were isolated from lam lung tissue, cultured and characterised using microscopy, immunocytochemistry and western blotting. fibroblast-like cells were identified in lung tissue using immunohistochemical markers. fibroblast chemotaxis toward lam cells was examined using migration assays and 3d cell culture. fibroblast-like cells were obtained from lam lungs: these cells had fibroblast-like morphology, actin stress fibres, full length tuberin protein and suppressible ribosomal protein s6 activity suggesting functional tsc-1/2 protein. fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast specific protein/s100a4 and fibroblast surface protein all stained subsets of cells within lam nodules from multiple donors. in a mouse model of lam, tuberin positive host derived cells were also present within lung nodules of xenografted tsc-2 null cells. in vitro, lam 621-101 cells and fibroblasts formed spontaneous aggregates over three days in 3d co-cultures. fibroblast chemotaxis was enhanced two fold by lam 621-101 conditioned medium (p=0.05), which was partially dependent upon lam cell derived cxcl12. further, lam cell conditioned medium also halved fibroblast apoptosis under serum free conditions (p=0.03). our findings suggest that lam nodules contain a significant population of fibroblast-like cells. analogous to cancer associated fibroblasts, these cells may provide a permissive environment for lam cell growth and contribute to the lung pathology of lam lung disease. the green fluorescence protein (gfp) from the ubi‐gfp/bl6 transgenic line was bred into c57bl/6j‐scid and c.b‐17‐scid mice for investigating host‐tumor cell interactions. these mice express high levels of gfp under the control of the ubiquitin promoter in virtually all cells examined. in tumor tissue generated by implanting tumor cells in the gfp transgenic scid mice, the tumor cells and tumor‐associated murine host cells were clearly distinguished by gfp expression. a population of cells expressing the endothelial cell marker vegfr‐2/flk‐1, and the progenitor markers c‐kit and sca‐1, were incorporated into tumor tissue. the majority of the flk‐1‐positive cells were hematopoietic‐derived cells that coexpressed cd45. to investigate the contribution of bone marrow‐derived cells to the formation of tumor vessels and stroma, tumor cells were implanted in nontransgenic scid mice that received a bone marrow transplant from gfp‐expressing scid mice. although gfp‐positive cells were readily detected by histology in tumors taken from bone marrow transplanted animals, they were spatially isolated and lacked organization. in contrast, if tumors were implanted in nontransgenic scid mice adjacent to a patch of transplanted gfp‐expressing skin, these tumors recruited gfp‐positive cells that organized into tumor vessels. the results demonstrate that hematopoietic‐derived cells, including flk‐1+/ cd45+ cells, readily colonized the tumor stroma but were minimally incorporated in the tumor vasculature. the majority of the tumor vessels were instead recruited from tissue adjacent to the tumor. the expression of flk‐1 on nonendothelial, tumor‐associated host cells raises the possibility that vegf antagonists, such as avastin, could inhibit tumor growth by a mechanism involving hematopoietic‐derived cd45+/flk‐1+ cells, in addition to direct suppression of endothelial cell function.—udagawa, t., puder, m., wood, m., schaefer, b. c., d'amato, r. j. analysis of tumor‐associated stromal cells using scid gfp transgenic mice: contribution of local and bone marrow‐derived host cells. faseb j. 20, 95–102 (2006)
oscillatory activity and its nonlinear dynamics are of fundamental importance for information processing in the central nervous system. here we show that in aperiodic oscillations, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), a member of the neurotrophin family, enhances the accuracy of action potentials in terms of spike reliability and temporal precision. cultured hippocampal neurons displayed irregular oscillations of membrane potential in response to sinusoidal 20-hz somatic current injection, yielding wobbly orbits in the phase space, i.e., a strange attractor. brief application of bdnf suppressed this unpredictable dynamics and stabilized membrane potential fluctuations, leading to rhythmical firing. even in complex oscillations induced by external stimuli of 40 hz (gamma) on a 5-hz (theta) carrier, bdnf-treated neurons generated more precisely timed spikes, i.e., phase-locked firing, coupled with theta-phase precession. these phenomena were sensitive to k252a, an inhibitor of tyrosine receptor kinases and appeared attributable to bdnf-evoked na(+) current. the data are the first indication of pharmacological control of endogenous chaos. bdnf diminishes the ambiguity of spike time jitter and thereby might assure neural encoding, such as spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. carbachol, a muscarinic receptor agonist, produced three distinct spontaneous oscillations in the ca3 region of rat hippocampal slices. carbachol concentrations in the 4–13 μm range produced regular synchronized ca3 discharges at 0.5–2 hz (carbachol‐delta). higher concentrations (13–60 μm) produced short episodes of 5–10 hz (carbachol‐theta) oscillations separated by nonsynchronous activity. concentrations of carbachol ranging from 8–25 μm also produced irregular episodes of high‐frequency discharges (carbachol‐gamma, 35–70 hz), in isolation or mixed with carbachol‐theta and carbachol‐delta. at carbachol concentrations sufficient to induce carbachol‐theta, low concentrations of apv reversibly transformed carbachol‐theta into carbachol‐delta. higher concentrations of d,l‐2‐amino‐5‐phosphonopentanoic acid (apv) reversibly and completely blocked carbachol‐theta. a systematic study of the effects of carbachol shows that the frequency of spontaneous oscillations depended nonlinearly on the level of muscarinic activation. field and intracellular recordings from ca1 and ca3 pyramidal cells and interneurons during carbachol‐induced rhythms revealed that the hippocampal circuitry preserved in the slice was capable of spontaneous activity over the range of frequencies observed in vivo and suggests that the presence of these rhythms could be under neuromodulatory control. hippocampus 10:187–197, 2000 © 2000 wiley‐liss, inc.
this study was conducted to investigate the hypothesis that the lungs in east coast fever are infiltrated by different subsets of lymphocytes that may be responsible in the pathogenesis of pulmonary edema. four steers, 7 – 10 months old, were experimentally infected by subcutaneous injection with 0.5 ml of live theileria parva sporozoites (muguga stabilate 3087). two others remained as uninfected controls. all six animals were clinically monitored daily before and after infection by screening peripheral blood smears, lymph node smears, rectal temperatures, lymph node enlargement, coughing, and dyspnea. also, blood samples were taken at intervals of 3-4 days and analysed for total rbc and wbc counts, hb, pcv, and differential leukocyte count. each of the infected animals were humanely exsanguinated to death under general anaesthesia at the onset of dyspnea, together with one of the controls for sampling of lung tissues. in addition, two lung tissue samples were collected from two ecf naturally infected cattle that were slaughtered during the advanced stage of the disease. the lung tissue samples from the experimentally and naturally infected animals were fixed in 4% neutral-buffered formaldehyde (ph 7.4) for 48 hours, and subjected to tissue processing procedures to obtain 4 mm thin sections that were stained routinely by h & e for histopathological examination and immunohistochemically by monoclonal antibodies labelled by streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complex to visualize lymphocyte there is strong evidence that class i mhc-restricted parasite-specific cd8+ ctl protect cattle against the protozoan parasite theileria parva. as part of an effort to develop a subunit vaccine for the induction of these responses, we have investigated the factors involved in the generation of t. parva-specific ctl in cattle. purified populations of bovine immune and naive cd8+ t cells were cocultured with autologous t. parva-infected lymphoblasts (tpl) in the presence or absence of immune cd4+ t cells or cytokine preparations. neither population developed ctl activity when cultured with tpl alone, whereas incorporation of immune cd4+ t cells in the cultures supported the generation of parasite-specific ctl from both immune and naive cd8+ precursors. the helper function of parasite-specific cd4+ t cells for immune, but not naive, ctl precursors could be replaced by cd4+ t cells responding to an unrelated ag or by the addition of t cell growth factors or recombinant bovine il-2. in experiments with two-chamber culture plates, in which cocultures of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells with tpl were separated by a semipermeable membrane, ctl activity was observed to develop only in immune precursor populations. hence, although bovine t. parva-specific cd8+ memory t cells need no helper signals other than il-2 for activation, their naive counterparts require close contact with responding parasite-specific cd4+ t cells. this may reflect essential receptor-ligand interactions, or alternatively, a requirement for more stringent microenvironmental cytokine conditions.
aging is associated with spatial memory impairments and with deficient encoding of information by the hippocampus. in young adult rats, recent studies on the firing properties of hippocampal neurons have emphasized the importance of the ca3 subregion in the rapid encoding of new spatial information. here, we compared the spatial firing patterns of ca1 and ca3 neurons in aged memory-impaired rats with those of young rats as they explored familiar and novel environments. we found that ca1 place cells in aged and young rats had similar firing characteristics in the familiar and novel environments. in contrast, aged ca3 place cells had higher firing rates in general and failed to change their firing rates and place fields as much as ca3 cells of young rats when the rats were introduced to a novel environment. thus, aged ca3 cells failed to rapidly encode new spatial information compared with young ca3 cells. these data suggest an important and selective contribution of ca3 dysfunction to age-related memory impairment. aged rats perform poorly on spatial learning tasks, a cognitive impairment which has been linked to the failure of hippocampal networks to fully encode changes in the external environment [barnes ca, suster ms, shen j, mcnaughton bl. multistability of cognitive maps in the hippocampus of old rats. nature 1997;388(6639):272-5; wilson ia, ikonen s, gureviciene i, mcmahan rw, gallagher m, eichenbaum h, et al. cognitive aging and the hippocampus: how old rats represent new environments. j neurosci 2004;24(15):3870-8]. to examine whether the impairment in hippocampal processing extends to conditions in which self-motion provides the cues for environmental change, we have analyzed spatial firing patterns of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in young and aged rats, as well as in young rats with selective cholinergic lesions, another model of cognitive aging. the rats walked between two visually identical environments, pitting self-motion cues that indicated environmental change against visual inputs that indicated no differences between environments. our results indicated that place cells in both aged and cholinergic-lesioned rats were equally likely as those of young rats to create new spatial representations in the second compartment. these findings suggest that the hippocampal network of aged rats is able to process changes in internally generated cues without rigidity, but that incomplete processing of external landmark cues may lead to impaired spatial learning.
accumulation of unfolded protein within the endoplasmic reticulum (er) attenuates mrna translation through perk-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 on ser51 of the alpha subunit (eif2alpha). to elucidate the role of eif2alpha phosphorylation, we engineered mice for conditional expression of homozygous ser51ala mutant eif2alpha. the absence of eif2alpha phosphorylation in beta cells caused a severe diabetic phenotype due to heightened and unregulated proinsulin translation; defective intracellular trafficking of er cargo proteins; increased oxidative damage; reduced expression of stress response and beta-cell-specific genes; and apoptosis. however, glucose intolerance and beta cell death in these mice were attenuated by a diet containing antioxidant. we conclude that phosphorylation of eif2alpha coordinately attenuates mrna translation, prevents oxidative stress, and optimizes er protein folding to support insulin production. the finding that increased proinsulin synthesis causes oxidative damage in beta cells may reflect events in the beta cell failure associated with insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. evidence for the physiological functions of ucp2 and ucp3 is critically reviewed. they do not mediate adaptive thermogenesis, but they may be significantly thermogenic under specific pharmacological conditions. there is strong evidence that the mild regulated uncoupling they cause attenuates mitochondrial ros production, protects against cellular damage, and diminishes insulin secretion. evidence that they export fatty acids physiologically is weak. ucp2 and ucp3 are important potential targets for treatment of aging, degenerative diseases, diabetes, and perhaps obesity.
due to recent breakthroughs in hash functions cryptanalysis, some new hash schemes have been proposed. grindahl is a novel hash function, designed by knudsen, rechberger and thomsen and published at fse 2007. it has the particularity that it follows the rijndael design strategy, with an efficiency comparable to sha-256. this paper provides the first cryptanalytic work on this new scheme. we show that the 256-bit version of grindahl is not collision resistant. with a work effort of approximatively 2112 hash computations, one can generate a collision. we introduce vsh, very smooth hash, a new s-bit hash function that is provably collision-resistant assuming the hardness of finding nontrivial modular square roots of very smooth numbers modulo an s-bit composite. by very smooth, we mean that the smoothness bound is some fixed polynomial function of s. we argue that finding collisions for vsh has the same asymptotic complexity as factoring using the number field sieve factoring algorithm, i.e., subexponential in s.    vsh is theoretically pleasing because it requires just a single multiplication modulo the s-bit composite per ω(s) message-bits (as opposed to o(logs) message-bits for previous provably secure hashes). it is relatively practical. a preliminary implementation on a 1ghz pentium iii processor that achieves collision resistance at least equivalent to the difficulty of factoring a 1024-bit rsa modulus, runs at 1.1 megabyte per second, with a moderate slowdown to 0.7mb/s for 2048-bit rsa security.    vsh can be used to build a fast, provably secure randomised trapdoor hash function, which can be applied to speed up provably secure signature schemes (such as cramer-shoup) and designated-verifier signatures.
regulation of gene expression by small noncoding rnas (srnas) plays a critical role in bacterial response to physiological stresses. nrrf, a trans-acting srna in neisseria meningitidis and neisseria gonorrhoeae, has been shown in the meningococcus to control indirectly, in response to iron (fe) availability, the transcription of genes encoding subunits of succinate dehydrogenase, a fe-requiring enzyme. given that in other organisms, srnas target multiple mrnas to control gene expression, we used a global approach to examine the role of nrrf in controlling gonococcal transcription. three strains, including n. gonorrhoeae fa1090, an nrrf deletion mutant, and a complemented derivative, were examined using a custom combimatrix microarray to assess the role of this srna in controlling gene expression in response to fe availability. in the absence of nrrf, the mrna half-lives for 12 genes under fe-depleted growth conditions were longer than those in fa1090. the 12 genes controlled by nrrf encoded proteins with biological functions including energy metabolism, oxidative stress, antibiotic resistance, and amino acid synthesis, as well as hypothetical proteins and a regulatory protein whose functions are not fully understood. the mtrr transcriptional-regulatory protein is known to repress transcription of the mtrcde operon, which encodes a multidrug efflux pump possessed by neisseria gonorrhoeae that is important in the ability of gonococci to resist certain hydrophobic antibiotics, detergents, dyes, and host-derived antimicrobials. in order to determine whether mtrr can exert regulatory action on other gonococcal genes, we performed a whole-genome microarray analysis using total rna extracted from actively growing broth cultures of isogenic mtrr-positive and mtrr-negative gonococci. we determined that, at a minimum, 69 genes are directly or indirectly subject to mtrr control, with 47 being mtrr repressed and 22 being mtrr activated. rpoh, which encodes the general stress response sigma factor rpoh (sigma 32), was found by dna-binding studies to be directly repressed by mtrr, as it was found to bind to a dna sequence upstream of rpoh that included sites within the rpoh promoter. mtrr also repressed the expression of certain rpoh-regulated genes, but this regulation was likely indirect and a reflection of mtrr control of rpoh expression. inducible expression of mtrr was found to repress rpoh expression and to increase gonococcal susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) and an antibiotic (erythromycin) recognized by the mtrc-mtrd-mtre efflux pump system. we propose that, apart from its ability to control the expression of the mtrcde-encoded efflux pump operon and, as a consequence, levels of gonococcal resistance to host antimicrobials (e.g., antimicrobial peptides) recognized by the efflux pump, the ability of mtrr to regulate the expression levels of rpoh and rpoh-regulated genes also modulates levels of gonococcal susceptibility to h(2)o(2).
agn43 encodes a major phase-variable outer-membrane protein, antigen 43 (ag43), involved in autoaggregation of escherichia coli cells. the gene is present in single copy on the chromosome of e. coli k-12. in contrast, southern hybridization and gene inactivation studies demonstrate that control producer strain e. coli ml308-225 possesses duplicate copies of agn43 (agn43a and agn43b). construction and analyses of single and double knockout mutants clearly show that both alleles are capable of expressing antigen in a phase-variable manner, with observed differences in the on<-->off switch frequencies appearing to favour expression of ag43b under conditions of normal laboratory growth. comparative analysis of agn43a and agn43b gene sequences revealed 98% identity at the nucleotide and predicted protein levels, with differences in the protein sequence of the surface-expressed alpha(43) subunit altering the surface probability of one of the predicted epitopes. analysis of a panel of enteropathogenic e. coli strains by southern hybridization using agn43-specific gene probes provided strong evidence for the presence of varying numbers of agn43 alleles within clinical isolates. taken together, the results indicate the presence of a family of distinct ag43 proteins encoded by multiple chromosomal alleles. antigen 43 (ag43) is a prominent hetero-oligomeric protein complex in the outer membrane of escherichia coli. it is composed of two subunits. alpha 43 (m(r) 60, 000) and beta 43 (m(r) 53, 000) in 1:1 stoichiometry. alpha 43 is surface expressed, extends beyond the o-side chains of smooth lipopolysaccharide and is bound to the cell surface through an interaction with beta 43, itself an integral outer membrane protein, alpha 43 shows limited sequence homology with some enterobacterial adhesins. expression of ag43 is subject to reversible phase variation, the rates of variation from the ag43+ve to ag43-ve states in liquid minimal medium being approximately 2.2 x 10(-3), the corresponding rates from ag43-ve to ag43+ve states being approximately 1 x 10(-3). phase switching of genes encoding ag43 are transcriptionally regulated by dna methylation (deoxyadenosine methylase [dam] mutants being "locked off") and by oxyr (oxyr mutants being "locked on"). it is proposed that oxyr acts as a repressor of ag43 transcription by binding to unmethylated gatc sites in the regulatory region of the gene. sequencing and mapping has identified ag43 as the likely product of the metastable flu gene first described in 1980 by diderichsen and responsible for colony form variation in e. coli.
the present work aims at studying the effect of exopolysaccharides (eps) from lactobacillus acidophilus on the colon cancer cell lines in vitro. initial analysis showed that eps has antioxidative properties. eps was also found to induce cytotoxicity in two colon cancer cell lines, viz. hct15 and caco2 under normoxia and hypoxia. the membrane integrity was also found to be affected in eps-treated cells. once the toxic concentration was determined (5 mg/ml), the effect of eps on the messenger rna (mrna) expression of various genes was studied by quantitative real-time (rt)-pcr under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. the results suggest that eps downregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (hif-1α) and upregulated the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (timp-3), hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (hif-2α), and hemeoxygenase-1 (ho-1). an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) was also observed. these results show that eps may inhibit the expressions of genes involved in tumor angiogenesis and survival. increase in the expression of ho-1 also shows that eps have antioxidative properties. fungal isolates (aspergillus wentii 1, a. wentii 2, penicillium citrinum, penicillium granulatum) were selected to study their in vitro antioxidant potential by various assay procedures. czapek–dox’s medium was selected for the growth of fungi as it supported the best antioxidant activity based on their ec50 values, p. citrinum was the best followed by p. granulatum, a. wentii 1, and a. wentii 2. the chromatographic analyses showed several compounds possessing antioxidant activity in the fungal extracts. two such compounds were partially purified from p. citrinum which demonstrated potent antioxidant activity, equally effective or better than some of the standard antioxidants.
ammonia-oxidizing archaea (aoa) are ubiquitous and abundant and contribute significantly to the carbon and nitrogen cycles in the ocean. in this study, we assembled aoa draft genomes from two deep marine sediments from donghae, south korea, and svalbard, arctic region, by sequencing the enriched metagenomes. three major microorganism clusters belonging to thaumarchaeota, epsilonproteobacteria, and gammaproteobacteria were deduced from their 16s rrna genes, gc contents, and oligonucleotide frequencies. three archaeal genomes were identified, two of which were distinct and were designated ca. “nitrosopumilus koreensis” ar1 and “nitrosopumilus sediminis” ar2. ar1 and ar2 exhibited average nucleotide identities of 85.2% and 79.5% to n. maritimus, respectively. the ar1 and ar2 genomes contained genes pertaining to energy metabolism and carbon fixation as conserved in other aoa, but, conversely, had fewer heme-containing proteins and more copper-containing proteins than other aoa. most of the distinctive ar1 and ar2 genes were located in genomic islands (gis) that were not present in other aoa genomes or in a reference water-column metagenome from the sargasso sea. a putative gene cluster involved in urea utilization was found in the ar2 genome, but not the ar1 genome, suggesting niche specialization in marine aoa. co-cultured bacterial genome analysis suggested that bacterial sulfur and nitrogen metabolism could be involved in interactions with aoa. our results provide fundamental information concerning the metabolic potential of deep marine sedimentary aoa. ammonia-oxidizing archaea are ubiquitous in marine and terrestrial environments and now thought to be significant contributors to carbon and nitrogen cycling. the isolation of candidatus “nitrosopumilus maritimus” strain scm1 provided the opportunity for linking its chemolithotrophic physiology with a genomic inventory of the globally distributed archaea. here we report the 1,645,259-bp closed genome of strain scm1, revealing highly copper-dependent systems for ammonia oxidation and electron transport that are distinctly different from known ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. consistent with in situ isotopic studies of marine archaea, the genome sequence indicates n. maritimus grows autotrophically using a variant of the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutryrate pathway for carbon assimilation, while maintaining limited capacity for assimilation of organic carbon. this unique instance of archaeal biosynthesis of the osmoprotectant ectoine and an unprecedented enrichment of multicopper oxidases, thioredoxin-like proteins, and transcriptional regulators points to an organism responsive to environmental cues and adapted to handling reactive copper and nitrogen species that likely derive from its distinctive biochemistry. the conservation of n. maritimus gene content and organization within marine metagenomes indicates that the unique physiology of these specialized oligophiles may play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen.
abstract this study demonstrates that the envelope proteins of hepatitis b virus (hbv) could be incorporated into the lipid membrane of lentivirus pseudotype particles. the assembly procedure was initiated by the transfection of 293t cells with three plasmids: (i) a human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) packaging construct, (ii) a transfer plasmid expressing a reporter gene, and (iii) a plasmid expressing large (l), middle (m), and small (s) hbv envelope proteins. after 2 days, hepatitis b surface antigen and the antigenic forms of l, m, and s were detected at the cell surface by flow cytometry. also, virus particles that were able to infect cultured primary human hepatocytes (phh) were released. under optimal conditions, 50% of phh could be infected. in addition, the susceptibility of phh and the resistance of other cell types to the pseudotype particles were similar to those observed for hbv and hepatitis delta virus (hdv), which shares the same l, m, and s. furthermore, the infection of phh by the pseudotype was sensitive to known inhibitors of hbv and hdv entry. these findings of specific and efficient infection of hepatocytes could be applicable to liver-specific gene therapy and may help clarify the attachment and entry mechanism used by hbv and hdv. the pres domain at the n‐terminus of the large envelope protein (lhbs) of the hepatitis b virus is involved in (i) envelopment of viral nucleocapsids and (ii) binding to the host cell. while the first function suggests a cytosolic location of the pres domain during virion assembly, the function as an attachment site requires its translocation across the lipid bilayer and final exposure on the virion surface. we compared the transmembrane topology of newly synthesized lhbs in the endoplasmic reticulum (er) membrane with its topology in the envelope of secreted virions. protease sensitivity and the absence of glycosylation suggest that the entire pres domain of newly synthesized lhbs remains at the cytosolic side of er vesicles. however, virions secreted from transfected cell cultures or isolated from the blood of persistent virus carriers expose antibody binding sites and proteolytic cleavage sites of the pres domain at their surface in approximately half of the lhbs molecules. thus, pres domains appear to be transported across the viral lipid barrier by a novel post‐translational translocation mechanism to fulfil a dual function in virion assembly and attachment to the host cell.
despite their endangered status, the taxonomic relationship between the two geographically isolated south asian river dolphin populations has never been comprehensively assessed and remains contentious. here we present the first dedicated evaluation of the molecular phylogenetic relationship between the indus (platanista gangetica minor) and ganges (platanista gangetica gangetica) river dolphins using mitochondrial dna from the control region and cytochrome b, extracted from museum specimens. the 458 bp partial control region sequences from 26 indus river dolphin samples exhibited no variation. only six haplotypes were identified in the 31 (18 indus; 13 ganges) complete (856 bp) control region sequences obtained, none were shared between subspecies, and there were five fixed differences between them. similarly low genetic diversity was found in a 541 bp section of the cytochrome b gene (n = 29). the lack of shared haplotypes and fixed differences resulted in φst for the partial control region sequences of 0.932 (p < 0.0001) and fst of 0.843 (p < 0.0001), indicating the long-term absence of gene flow and clear genetic differentiation between the two geographically isolated populations. an externally calibrated molecular clock estimated that indus and ganges dolphins diverged around 550,000 years ago (95 % posterior probability 0.13–1.05 million years ago), possibly when dolphins from the ganges dispersed into the indus during drainage capture. uplift of mountains driven by tectonic forces can influence regional climate as well as regional drainage patterns, which in turn control the discharge of eroded sediment to the ocean. but the nature of the interactions between tectonic forces, climate and drainage evolution remains contested. here we reconstruct the erosional discharge from the indus river over the past 30 million years using seismic reflection data obtained from drill core samples from the arabian sea and neodymium isotope data. we find that the source of the indus sediments was dominated by erosion within and north of the indus suture zone until five million years ago; after that, the river began to receive more erosional products from himalayan sources. we propose that this change in the erosional pattern is caused by a rerouting of the major rivers of the punjab into the indus, which flowed east into the ganges river before that time. seismic reflection profiles from the indus fan suggest high mass accumulation rates during the pleistocene epoch partly driven by increased drainage to the indus river after five million years ago and partly by faster erosion linked to a stronger monsoon over the past four million years. our isotope stratigraphy for the indus fan provides strong evidence for a significant change in the geometry of western himalayan river systems in the recent geologic past.
abstractmain conclusionthis is an original study focus on erf gene response to alkaline stress. gserf6functions as  transcription factor and significantly enhanced plant tolerance to bicarbonate (hco3−) in transgenic arabidopsis.  alkaline stress is one of the most harmful, but little studied environmental factors, which negatively affects plant growth, development and yield. the cause of alkaline stress is mainly due to the damaging consequence of high concentration of the bicarbonate ion, high-ph, and osmotic shock to plants. the ap2/erf family genes encode plant-specific transcription factors involved in diverse environmental stresses. however, little is known about their physiological functions, especially in alkaline stress responses. in this study, we functionally characterized a novel erf subfamily gene, gserf6 from alkaline-tolerant wild soybean (glycine soja). in wild soybean, gserf6 was rapidly induced by nahco3 treatment, and its overexpression in arabidopsis enhanced transgenic plant tolerance to nahco3 challenge. interestingly, gserf6 transgenic lines also displayed increased tolerance to khco3 treatment, but not to high ph stress, implicating that gserf6 may participate specifically in bicarbonate stress responses. we also found that gserf6 overexpression up-regulated the transcription levels of bicarbonate-stress-inducible genes such as nadp-me, h+-ppase and h+-atpase, as well as downstream stress-tolerant genes such as rd29a, cor47 and kini. gserf6 overexpression and nahco3 stress also altered the expression patterns of plant hormone synthesis and hormone-responsive genes. conjointly, our results suggested that gserf6 is a positive regulator of plant alkaline stress by increasing bicarbonate ionic resistance specifically, providing a new insight into the regulation of gene expression under alkaline conditions. nadp-malic enzyme (nadp-me, ec 1.1.1.40) functions in many different pathways in plants, and has recently been implicated in plant defense such as in responses to wounding and uv-b radiation. in this study, we isolated a complementary dna (cdna) clone by using the differential display method and screening of a root cdna library of rice (oryza sativa. l) under carbonate (nahco3) stress, and identified it as one of the rice nadp-me genes (we named it nadp-me2, genbank accession no. ab053295). the 5′ end of nadp-me2 was obtained by the 5′-race method, and the full-length cdna had a length of 2217 bp encoding 593 amino acids. expression of nadp-me2 mrna in roots was induced by stress from carbonates (nahco3 and na2co3), nacl, and environmental ph changes. nadp-me2 transcripts increased during 72-h exposures to nahco3, nacl, and peg stresses. furthermore, nadp-me activities in leaves and roots of rice seedlings increased by more than 50% in the presence of carbonates (nahco3 and na2co3), nacl, and peg. these results indicate that rice nadp-me2 responds to salts and osmotic stresses. transgenic arabidopsis plants over-expressing nadp-me2 were obtained through transformation, screening, northern analysis and in situ nadp-me activity assay. transgenic arabidopsis plants over-expressing nadp-me2 grew well in 1/2 × ms medium with 100 mm nacl or 4% mannitol, whereas growth of wild-type (wt) arabidopsis seedlings was strongly inhibited. in addition, under 125 mm nacl stress, the root lengths of transgenic lines were about twice as long as those of the wt. these results suggest that nadp-me2 has a role in enhancing tolerance of plants to salt and osmotic stress.
objective: breast cancer patients mostly rely on their partners for support in dealing with their cancer diagnosis and treatment. genetic counseling and brca1/2 testing during primary treatment may add to demands made on their partners. this study aimed to gain insight into the extent of psychological distress in partners of recently diagnosed patients and to find factors to help identify couples vulnerable to high psychological distress after an active approach for genetic counseling. background: despite the potential importance of communication about genetic testing between test participants and their significant others, little is known about social support and communication between women undergoing brca1 and brca2 testing and their partners.purpose: the aims of this longitudinal study were to examine communication about genetic testing during and following testing and to evaluate whether communication is associated with psychological distress reported by test participants and their partners.methods: participants were 153 women who were undergoing genetic testing and 118 partners of women undergoing testing. relationship communication and distress were evaluated at the time of pretest education and 6 months postdisclosure.results: overall, the decision to undergo testing was discussed by the majority of test participants and partners, and most couples felt their partners were supportive. most women disclosed their results to their partners. longitudinal analyses suggested that less support and protective buffering were associated with greater distress 6 months postdisclosure among test participants, whereas lower comfort in sharing concerns and partner support were associated with lower distress 6 months postdisclosure among partners.conclusions: the results of this study suggest that the majority of couples respond supportively during the test experience, but for a small subset of couples the process can strain the relationship. partner support during this process is important, particularly for test participants dealing with an uninformative test result.
backgrounddata on risk factors of recurrent bacterial vaginosis (rbv) are still scarce. we used data from female sex workers (fsw) participating in a randomized controlled microbicide trial to examine predictors of bv recurrence.methodstrial’s participants with at least an episode of bv which was treated and/or followed by a negative bv result and at least one subsequent visit offering bv testing were included in the analysis. behavioural and medical data were collected monthly while laboratory testing for sti and genital tract infections were performed quarterly. the andersen-gill proportional hazards model was used to determine predictors of bv recurrence both in bivariate and multivariate analyses.results440 women were included and the incidence rate for rbv was 20.8 recurrences/100 person-months (95% confidence interval (ci) =18.1–23.4). in the multivariate analysis controlling for the study site, recent vaginal cleansing as reported at baseline with adjusted hazard-ratio (ahr)=1.30, 95% ci = 1.02-1.64 increased the risk of bv recurrence, whereas consistent condom use (ccu) with the primary partner (ahr=0.68, 95% ci=0.49-0.93) and vaginal candidiasis (ahr=0.70, 95% ci=0.53-0.93), both treated as time-dependent variables, were associated with decreased risk of rbv.conclusionthis study confirms the importance of counselling high-risk women with rbv about the adverse effects of vaginal cleansing and the protective effects of condom use with all types of partners for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections, including bv. more prospective studies on risk factors of bv recurrence are warranted.trial registrationtrial registration: nct00153777 bacterial vaginosis (bv) is characterized by dramatic changes in the vaginal ecosystem. women without evidence of vaginal infection may exhibit transient changes in their flora. we prospectively followed up women by using diaries and self-obtained vaginal smears to correlate behaviors with changes in flora. the majority of women (38/51, 78%) had significant, although transient, changes. behaviors associated with unstable flora were a history of bv, a greater number of partners, and more frequent episodes of receptive oral sex. only the latter remained significantly associated in the multivariate analysis. variables that were associated with day-to-day variability in the flora included use of vaginal medication, menses, greater number of partners, spermicide use, more frequent vaginal intercourse, and less frequent use of condoms. only a minority of women (11/51, 22%) maintained a "normal" lactobacillus-predominant flora. factors associated with instability of the flora are similar to those epidemiologically associated with bv.
background in these reported cases, we observed the outcomes of skin take and wound healing using 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate glue, which was used as tissue glue in the reconstruction of complex genital skin loss due to fournier gangrene.   methods fifteen patients with fournier's gangrene were treated in this study. after initial surgical debridement, all defects were repaired using stsg. in this method a thin layer of 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate was dripped on the recipient site immediately before graft application. all wounds were followed up postoperatively and observed for evidence of graft take, seroma or hematoma formation, drainage, and infection. patient and physician satisfaction were also determined.   results grafts were completely accepted in all fifteen patients. none of the patients had wound infection, seroma, hematoma, or other complications.   conclusion use of 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate glue (glueseal) for stsg fixation in complex genital skin defects after fournier gangrene may be an acceptable alternative to conventional surgical closure with a good cosmetic outcome. further studies are needed to confirm our initial success with this approach. background in recent years, the use of synthetic glues has become an established practice in several areas of surgical treatment. for example, they are used in open and laparoscopic surgery and in digestive tract endoscopy, interventional radiology, and vascular neuroradiology. the experiments in this study were aimed at elucidating that suture-based permanent mesh fixation can be replaced by fixation with n-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate glue (glubran2) for surgical repair of abdominal wall hernias.   materials and methods in 25 wistar rats, two hernia defects (1.5 cm in diameter) per animal were created bilaterally in the midline of the abdominal wall. the peritoneum was spared. the lesions were left untreated for 10 d to achieve a chronic condition. then the defects were covered with timesh extralight (2 × 2 cm) and fixed by 30 μl of glubran2 or traditional suture. the time points of sacrifice were 17 and 28 d, 3, 4, and 5 mo. at autopsy, histology and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate the inflammatory response and the presence of apoptotic cells respectively.   results mesh fixation was excellent in all samples at each time point. at application sites, the inflammatory reaction was mild with a small number of macrophages and vascularized connective tissue presence around glue and mesh threads. glue residues were observed in histologic sections at each time point. no presence of apoptotic cells was found.   conclusions this study demonstrated that glubran2 can effectively replace traditional suture in mesh fixation without affecting tissue healing and determining a physiological inflammatory reaction at the abdominal wall site.
the vast majority of previous studies in authorship attribution assume the existence of documents (or parts of documents) labeled by authorship to be used as training instances in either closed-set or open-set attribution. however, in several applications it is not easy or even possible to find such labeled data and it is necessary to build unsupervised attribution models that are able to estimate similarities/differences in personal style of authors. the shared tasks on author clustering and author diarization at pan 2016 focus on such unsupervised authorship attribution problems. the former deals with single-author documents and aims at grouping documents by authorship and establishing authorship links between documents. the latter considers multi-author documents and attempts to segment a document into authorial components, a task strongly associated with intrinsic plagiarism detection. this paper presents an overview of the two tasks including evaluation datasets, measures, results, as well as a survey of a total of 10 submissions (8 for author clustering and 2 for author diarization). with its close ties to the web, the ir community is destined to leverage the dissemination and collaboration capabilities that the web provides today. especially with the advent of the software as a service principle, an ir community is conceivable that publishes experiments executable by anyone over the web. a review of recent sigir papers shows that we are far away from this vision of collaboration. the benefits of publishing ir experiments as a service are striking for the community as a whole, and include potential to boost research profiles and reputation. however, the additional work must be kept to a minimum and sensitive data must be kept private for this paradigm to become an accepted practice. to foster experiments as a service in ir, we present a web framework for experiments that addresses the outlined challenges and possesses a unique set of compelling features in comparison to existing solutions. we also describe how our reference implementation is already used officially as an evaluation platform for an established international plagiarism detection competition.
tank-binding kinase 1 (tbk1) and inducible iκb-kinase (ikk-i) are central regulators of type-i interferon induction. they are associated with three adaptor proteins called tank, sintbad (or tbkbp1) and nap1 (or tbkbp2, azi2) whose functional relationship to tbk1 and ikk-i is poorly understood. we performed a systematic affinity purification–mass spectrometry approach to derive a comprehensive tbk1/ikk-i molecular network. the most salient feature of the network is the mutual exclusive interaction of the adaptors with the kinases, suggesting distinct alternative complexes. immunofluorescence data indicated that the individual adaptors reside in different subcellular locations. tank, sintbad and nap1 competed for binding of tbk1. the binding site for all three adaptors was mapped to the c-terminal coiled-coil 2 region of tbk1. point mutants that affect binding of individual adaptors were used to reconstitute tbk1/ikk-i-deficient cells and dissect the functional relevance of the individual kinase-adaptor edges within the network. using a microarray-derived gene expression signature of tbk1 in response virus infection or poly(i∶c) stimulation, we found that tbk1 activation was strictly dependent on the integrity of the tbk1/tank interaction. toll-like receptors (tlrs) are activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns to induce innate immune responses and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interferons and anti-inflammatory cytokines. tlrs activate downstream effectors through adaptors that contain toll/interleukin-1 receptor (tir) domains, but the mechanisms accounting for diversification of tlr effector functions are unclear. to dissect biochemically tlr signalling, we established a system for isolating signalling complexes assembled by dimerized adaptors. using myd88 as a prototypical adaptor, we identified tnf receptor-associated factor 3 (traf3) as a new component of tir signalling complexes that is recruited along with traf6. using myeloid cells from traf3- and traf6-deficient mice, we show that traf3 is essential for the induction of type i interferons (ifn) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (il-10), but is dispensable for expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. in fact, traf3-deficient cells overproduce pro-inflammatory cytokines owing to defective il-10 production. despite their structural similarity, the functions of traf3 and traf6 are largely distinct. traf3 is also recruited to the adaptor trif (toll/il-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing ifn-β) and is required for marshalling the protein kinase tbk1 (also called nak) into tir signalling complexes, thereby explaining its unique role in activation of the ifn response.
in this monograph, we ask whether various kinds of intellectual, physical, and social activities produce cognitive enrichment effects—that is, whether they improve cognitive performance at different points of the adult life span, with a particular emphasis on old age. we begin with a theoretical framework that emphasizes the potential of behavior to influence levels of cognitive functioning. according to this framework, the undeniable presence of age-related decline in cognition does not invalidate the view that behavior can enhance cognitive functioning. instead, the course of normal aging shapes a zone of possible functioning, which reflects person-specific endowments and age-related constraints. individuals influence whether they function in the higher or lower ranges of this zone by engaging in or refraining from beneficial intellectual, physical, and social activities. from this point of view, the potential for positive change, or plasticity, is maintained in adult cognition. it is an argument that is supported by newer research in neuroscience showing neural plasticity in various aspects of central nervous system functioning, neurochemistry, and architecture. this view of human potential contrasts with static conceptions of cognition in old age, according to which decline in abilities is fixed and individuals cannot slow its course. furthermore, any understanding of cognition as it occurs in everyday life must make a distinction between basic cognitive mechanisms and skills (such as working-memory capacity) and the functional use of cognition to achieve goals in specific situations. in practice, knowledge and expertise are critical for effective functioning, and the available evidence suggests that older adults effectively employ specific knowledge and expertise and can gain new knowledge when it is required. we conclude that, on balance, the available evidence favors the hypothesis that maintaining an intellectually engaged and physically active lifestyle promotes successful cognitive aging. first, cognitive-training studies have demonstrated that older adults can improve cognitive functioning when provided with intensive training in strategies that promote thinking and remembering. the early training literature suggested little transfer of function from specifically trained skills to new cognitive tasks; learning was highly specific to the cognitive processes targeted by training. recently, however, a new generation of studies suggests that providing structured experience in situations demanding executive coordination of skills—such as complex video games, task-switching paradigms, and divided attention tasks—train strategic control over cognition that does show transfer to different task environments. these studies suggest that there is considerable reserve potential in older adults' cognition that can be enhanced through training. second, a considerable number of studies indicate that maintaining a lifestyle that is intellectually stimulating predicts better maintenance of cognitive skills and is associated with a reduced risk of developing alzheimer's disease in late life. our review focuses on longitudinal evidence of a connection between an active lifestyle and enhanced cognition, because such evidence admits fewer rival explanations of observed effects (or lack of effects) than does cross-sectional evidence. the longitudinal evidence consistently shows that engaging in intellectually stimulating activities is associated with better cognitive functioning at later points in time. other studies show that meaningful social engagement is also predictive of better maintenance of cognitive functioning in old age. these longitudinal findings are also open to important rival explanations, but overall, the available evidence suggests that activities can postpone decline, attenuate decline, or provide prosthetic benefit in the face of normative cognitive decline, while at the same time indicating that late-life cognitive changes can result in curtailment of activities. given the complexity of the dynamic reciprocal relationships between stimulating activities and cognitive function in old age, additional research will be needed to address the extent to which observed effects validate a causal influence of an intellectually engaged lifestyle on cognition. nevertheless, the hypothesis that an active lifestyle that requires cognitive effort has long-term benefits for older adults' cognition is at least consistent with the available data. furthermore, new intervention research that involves multimodal interventions focusing on goal-directed action requiring cognition (such as reading to children) and social interaction will help to address whether an active lifestyle enhances cognitive function. third, there is a parallel literature suggesting that physical activity, and aerobic exercise in particular, enhances older adults' cognitive function. unlike the literature on an active lifestyle, there is already an impressive array of work with humans and animal populations showing that exercise interventions have substantial benefits for cognitive function, particularly for aspects of fluid intelligence and executive function. recent neuroscience research on this topic indicates that exercise has substantial effects on brain morphology and function, representing a plausible brain substrate for the observed effects of aerobic exercise and other activities on cognition. our review identifies a number of areas where additional research is needed to address critical questions. for example, there is considerable epidemiological evidence that stress and chronic psychological distress are negatively associated with changes in cognition. in contrast, less is known about how positive attributes, such as self-efficacy, a sense of control, and a sense of meaning in life, might contribute to preservation of cognitive function in old age. it is well known that certain personality characteristics such as conscientiousness predict adherence to an exercise regimen, but we do not know whether these attributes are also relevant to predicting maintenance of cognitive function or effective compensation for cognitive decline when it occurs. likewise, more information is needed on the factors that encourage maintenance of an active lifestyle in old age in the face of elevated risk for physiological decline, mechanical wear and tear on the body, and incidence of diseases with disabling consequences, and whether efforts to maintain an active lifestyle are associated with successful aging, both in terms of cognitive function and psychological and emotional well-being. we also discuss briefly some interesting issues for society and public policy regarding cognitive-enrichment effects. for example, should efforts to enhance cognitive function be included as part of a general prevention model for enhancing health and vitality in old age? we also comment on the recent trend of business marketing interventions claimed to build brain power and prevent age-related cognitive decline, and the desirability of direct research evidence to back claims of effectiveness for specific products. the authors examined longitudinal change in chess skill using a multilevel model analysis of a large database of active, elite chess players (n = 5,011). parameters estimated from quadratic growth curves indicated that the age of peak performance occurs later in life than originally proposed and that this peak is independent of initial skill level. the findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that aging is slightly kinder to the initially more able, who show milder decline past their peak. higher tournament activity levels predicted higher ratings overall and interacted with age in the initially more able sample, suggesting that activity had smaller effects on rating for older adults. the authors discuss implications of these findings for lifetime changes in skilled performance.
imprinted genes are expressed from only one parental allele and heterozygous loss involving the expressed allele is sufficient to produce complete loss of protein expression. genetic alterations are common in tumorigenesis but the role of imprinted genes in this process is not well understood. in earlier work we mutagenized mice heterozygous for the neurofibromatosis i tumor suppressor gene (nf1) to model radiotherapy-associated second malignant neoplasms that arise in irradiated nf1 patients. expression analysis of tumor cell lines established from our mouse models identified grb10 expression as widely absent. grb10 is an imprinted gene and polymorphism analysis of cell lines and primary tumors demonstrates that the expressed allele is commonly lost in diverse nf1 mutant tumors arising in our mouse models. we performed functional studies to test whether grb10 restoration or loss alter fundamental features of the tumor growth. restoring grb10 in nf1 mutant tumors decreases proliferation, decreases soft agar colony formation and downregulates ras signaling. conversely, grb10 silencing in untransformed mouse embryo fibroblasts significantly increased cell proliferation and increased ras-gtp levels. expression of a constitutively activated mek rescued tumor cells from grb10-mediated reduction in colony formation. these studies reveal that grb10 loss can occur during in vivo tumorigenesis, with a functional consequence in untransformed primary cells. in tumors, grb10 loss independently promotes ras pathway hyperactivation, which promotes hyperproliferation, an early feature of tumor development. in the context of a robust nf1 mutant mouse model of cancer this work identifies a novel role for an imprinted gene in tumorigenesis. tumorigenesis requires the interaction between different gene disruptions to convert anormal cell into a cancer cell. these gene disruptions can involve loss of expression ormisexpression of genes through genetic or epigenetic mutations. it is becoming clear that thesedisruptions are not isolated events in the genome, but are affected by genome architecture andthe syntenic relationship of alleles on chromosomes. a better understanding of the genetic andepigenetic changes in cancer is important for the rational design of new therapies. we haverecently shown that background-specific polymorphisms and loci under epigenetic regulationhave a strong effect on cancer susceptibility in a mouse model of astrocytoma. although thesemice carry mutations in p53 and ras signaling pathways (through mutation of the rasgapprotein, nf1), the susceptibility to different tumor types depends strongly on epigeneticregulation and does not show simple mendelian inheritance. our results demonstrate theimportance of genome architecture and how tumorigenesis can be accelerated by concomitantloss or gain of multiple genes in a single chromosome rearrangement. because genomearchitecture is very different between mice and humans, comparing patterns of genomicrearrangement in human cancer and mouse models may help distinguish causal genomic changesfrom correlative changes.
backgroundidentifying novel predictors of hematogenous metastasis is essential to select optimal therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer. the goal of this study was to clarify the clinical implications of p53 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (pdgfr-β) in pancreatic cancer using immunohistochemistry (ihc).methodsspecimens obtained by surgical resection and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (eus–fna) of the primary tumor were used for ihc. eus–fna was performed before any treatment. we analyzed the clinical implications of p53 and pdgfr-β ihc. we also performed a comparative analysis of the ihc findings between surgical and eus–fna specimens.resultsthis study involved 149 patients (120 who did not receive and 29 who received preoperative therapy). eus–fna specimens were obtained from 20 patients without preoperative therapy and 20 patients with preoperative therapy. abnormal p53 and high pdgfr-β expression was significantly correlated with a high incidence of hematogenous metastasis (p < 0.001) and poor postoperative survival (p = 0.006). in patients without preoperative therapy, the results for p53 and pdgfr-β staining were concordant between surgical and eus–fna specimens in 95 % of the cases. in patients with preoperative therapy, 80 and 70 % of the patients showed consistent p53 and pdgfr-β expression between surgical and eus–fna specimens, respectively.conclusionspancreatic cancer patients with simultaneous abnormal p53 and high pdgfr-β expression have a significantly higher risk of hematogenous metastasis and a poor prognosis after surgery. ihc evaluation using eus–fna specimens may be able to identify patients with highly metastatic pancreatic cancer who may benefit from aggressive therapeutic intervention. metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-associated death but has been difficult to study because it involves a series of rare, stochastic events. to capture these events, we developed a sensitive method to tag and track pancreatic epithelial cells in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. tagged cells invaded and entered the bloodstream unexpectedly early, before frank malignancy could be detected by rigorous histologic analysis; this behavior was widely associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (emt). circulating pancreatic cells maintained a mesenchymal phenotype, exhibited stem cell properties, and seeded the liver. emt and invasiveness were most abundant at inflammatory foci, and induction of pancreatitis increased the number of circulating pancreatic cells. conversely, treatment with the immunosuppressive agent dexamethasone abolished dissemination. these results provide insight into the earliest events of cellular invasion in situ and suggest that inflammation enhances cancer progression in part by facilitating emt and entry into the circulation.
introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate the diversity and similarity of enterococcus faecalis genotype isolates from multiple oral sites using repetitive sequence‐based polymerase chain reaction and arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (ap‐pcr). methods: forty‐two endodontically treated teeth with apical periodontitis were selected. a total of 126 microbial samples were collected from 3 different sites (saliva, pulp chamber, and root canals, all n = 42) during the nonsurgical retreatment procedures. after growth on m‐enterococcus agar, the colonies were isolated, characterized as gram‐positive catalase negative cocci, and identified using an api 20 strep kit (biomérieux, marcy‐l'etoile, france). seventy‐four colonies from 10 patients were confirmed as e. faecalis by polymerase chain reaction (16s ribosomal rna). repetitive sequence‐based polymerase chain reactions using eric and ap‐pcr using rw3a primers were performed in all 74 colonies. fingerprints were analyzed and separated into genotypic groups based on the dice coefficient percentage of similarity (82% or greater) as determined by eric reproducibility assays involving e. faecalis controls. results: seven different e. faecalis genotypes (gts) (gt1 = 27%, gt2 = 17.6%, gt3 = 1.3%, gt4 = 18.9%, gt5 = 9.5%, gt6 = 14.9%, and gt7 = 10.8%) were observed in different subjects and oral sites associated with endodontic failure. remarkably, in 4 of 5 patients, the same gts present in the infected root canals were also isolated from either the pulp chamber or the saliva samples. in particular, gt6 was detected in all 3 oral sites of patient 37. conclusions: e. faecalis gts isolated from saliva, the pulp chamber, and the root canal were similar using the rep‐pcr and ap‐pcr methods. these findings suggest that coronal microleakage is a conceivable cause of endodontic failure. highlightstracking the pathways of the root canal reinfection.dna fingerprints from samples from saliva, pulp chamber and root canal.determination of diversity and similarity of e. faecalis genotypes. oligonucleotide probes which match consensus sequences of the repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep) element hybridize to genomic dna of diverse bacterial species. primers based on the rep sequence generate complex band patterns with genomic dna in the polymerase chain reaction (pcr), a technique named rep-pcr. we used rep-pcr with genomic dna to fingerprint 47 isolates of citrobacter diversus. previously, 37 were assigned electrophoretic types (ets) by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and 35 were evaluated by using outer membrane protein profiles. fingerprints were compared by visual inspection and by similarity coefficients (simcs) based on the number of common bands versus total bands between two given isolates. dna fingerprints were highly similar visually for patient pairs and outbreak-related sets. simcs for these were > or = 0.952. fingerprints of isolates with different ets generally were distinctive. among 21 unrelated isolates representing 15 ets, only 6 of 210 comparisons had simcs of > or = 0.952. rep-pcr rapidly generated dna fingerprints which were highly similar for epidemiologically linked isolates of c. diversus and distinct for previously characterized strains within this species. the ability of this method to discriminate between c. diversus isolates with the same biotype was similar to that of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and outer membrane protein profiles. rep-pcr may be useful in evaluation of apparent outbreaks of this or other bacterial species which possess these extragenic, repetitive elements.
early‐onset bipolar (bp) disorder and other poor prognosis characteristics are more prevalent in patients from the united states than from the netherlands and germany (abbreviated as europe). we explored the impact of parental loading for affective illness on onset and other characteristics of bp disorder. objective: to compare the prevalence rates of mental disorders among children of parents with bipolar disorder and of parents with no mental disorders. method: seventeen studies, meeting specific selection criteria, were included in the metaanalyses. risks for mental disorders among children were estimated by aggregating raw data from the selected studies. results: results indicate that in comparison with children of parents with no mental disorders, children of parents with bipolar disorder are 2.7 times more likely to develop any mental disorder and 4.0 times more likely to develop an affective disorder. the metaanalyses indicate that during childhood and adolescence, the risks for any mental disorder and for affective disorders in children are consistently but moderately related to having a parent who suffers from bipolar disorder. conclusions: risk factors that could account for the psychopathology observed in children of bipolar parents are explored.
bacterial nanocellulose (bnc), synthesized by the bacterium gluconacetobacter xylinus, is composed of highly hydrated fibrils (99 % water) with high mechanical strength. these exceptional material properties make bnc a novel biomaterial for many potential medical and tissue engineering applications. recently, bnc with cellulose content of 15 % has been proposed as an implant material for auricular cartilage replacement, since it matches the mechanical requirements of human auricular cartilage. this study investigates the biocompatibility of bnc with increased cellulose content (17 %) to evaluate its response in vitro and in vivo. cylindrical bnc structures (ø48 × 20 mm) were produced, purified in a built-in house perfusion system, and compressed to increase the cellulose content in bnc hydrogels. the reduction of endotoxicity of the material was quantified by bacterial endotoxin analysis throughout the purification process. afterward, the biocompatibility of the purified bnc hydrogels with cellulose content of 17 % was assessed in vitro and in vivo, according to standards set forth in iso 10993. the endotoxin content in non-purified bnc (2,390 endotoxin units (eu)/ml) was reduced to 0.10 eu/ml after the purification process, level well below the endotoxin threshold set for medical devices. furthermore, the biocompatibility tests demonstrated that densified bnc hydrogels are non-cytotoxic and cause a minimal foreign body response. in support with our previous findings, this study concludes that bnc with increased cellulose content of 17 % is a promising non-resorbable biomaterial for auricular cartilage tissue engineering, due to its similarity with auricular cartilage in terms of mechanical strength and host tissue response. phosphorylcholine (pc)-based polymers have been used in a variety of medical device applications to improve biocompatibility. the use of pc-based materials for biomaterials is associated with low protein adsorption, reduced complement activation, low inflammatory response and cell adhesion. for some medical device applications however, materials that support cell adhesion are also beneficial, allowing host interaction and encouraging full incorporation within the body. as previous studies have suggested that cell adhesion to materials is enhanced by the addition of charge, pc-based polymers have therefore been modified to incorporate various concentrations of cationic charge. in this study, the affect of cationic charge on a range of biological responses was investigated. in vitro assays have been used to assess the adsorption of protein onto the materials surface, the adhesion of mouse fibroblasts and rabbit corneal epithelial cells and the adhesion of human mononuclear cells and granulocytes. the results corroborate previous work showing that pc without charge significantly reduces protein adsorption, cell adhesion and inflammatory cell activation. the addition of cationic charge to pc polymers however, resulted in an increase in all of the above responses. this increase did not however, increase linearly with cationic monomer concentration. the differences in cell adhesion are discussed in terms of differences in protein adsorption, cytotoxicity and/or stability of the different cationic polymer coatings.
fabry disease is a rare x-linked disorder caused by mutations in the α-galactosidase gene (gla), the resultant deficiency of lysosomal α-galactosidase enzyme activity leading to systemic accumulation of globotriaosylceramide and other glycosphingolipids. gla knockout mice (“fabry mice”) were generated as an animal model for fabry disease but, as they do not manifest progressive chronic kidney disease (ckd), their relevance as a model for human fabry nephropathy is uncertain. we evaluated the histological alterations in the kidneys of fabry mice at different ages, as contrasted to those observed in wild-type mice. furthermore, we compared the renal histological alterations of fabry mice to the kidney pathology reported in patients with fabry disease at comparable age ranges and across different ckd stages, using a scoring system that has been developed for fabry nephropathy. fabry mice are phenotypically different from wild-type mice, displaying progressive age-related accumulation of glycosphingolipids in all types of renal cells. there were no statistically significant differences between fabry mice and fabry patients in the prevalence of glycosphingolipid storage per renal cell type with the exceptions of mesangial (higher in humans) and proximal tubular cells (higher in mice). however, fabry mice lack the nonspecific histological glomerulosclerotic and interstitial fibrotic renal lesions that best correlate with progressive ckd in fabry patients, and do not develop large podocyte inclusions. we postulate that the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying these species differences, may contribute important clues to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of fabry nephropathy. early renal changes in hemizygous and heterozygous patients with fabry's disease. renal biopsy specimens were obtained for light and electron microscopy in 12 patients with fabry's disease (9 hemizygous males and 3 heterozygous females), ranging in age from 7 to 51yr. renal function and blood pressure were normal in all patients. in hemizygous patients, diffuse glycolipid accumulation was observed early in life in every glomerular, vascular, and interstitial cell; tubules were involved irregularly, predominantly in distal convoluted tubules and henle's loop. in heterozygous females, the glycolipid storage had the same morphological features but was found irregularly, being absent in one patient and present patchily in the 2 others: some cells were normal, others were involved massively. associated degenerative renal changes were present in all patients but one (a heterozygous female) and were clearly age-related. they first affected vessels as round fibrinoid deposits resulting from necrosis of severely involved smooth muscle cells. in older patients, intimal thickening was superimposed, and degenerative glomerular and tubular changes were noted. they may have been related partly to ischemic damage. in addition, mesangial cell necrosis could have contributed to the development of glomerular sclerosis. our findings in heterozy-gotes are consistent with lyon's hypothesis of x chromosome inactivation in each female cell. they suggest that renal glycolipid involvement and urine a-glactosidase activity are closely related. they provide theoretical evidence against the possible benefits of enzyme replacement therapy. lesions renales precoces chez les sujets hemizygotes et heterozygotes atteints de maladie de fabry. les biopsies renales de 12 malades âges de 7 a 51 ans (9 sujets hemizygotes et 3 heterozygotes) ont ete etudiees en microscopie optique et electronique. tous avaient une fonction renale et une pression arterielle normales. chez les sujets de sexe masculin, hemizygotes, l'accumulation de glycolipides est precoce et diffuse, presente dans toutes les cellules glomerulaires, interstitielles et vasculaires. dans les tubes la surcharge est irreguliere et predomine sur les tubes contournes distaux et les anses de henle. chez les femmes transmettrices l'aspect est moins monomorphe: la surcharge est absente chez une malade, elle est presente chez les deux autres mais touche irregulierement les cellules tant glomerulaires, interstitielles et vasculaires que tubulaires. les lesions degeneratives du parenchyme renal, associees a la surcharge, sont presentes dans tous les cas sauf chez une des transmettrices, leur severite est correlee avec l'âge des malades. elles touchent d'abord les vaisseaux sous la forme de depots fibrinoides arrondis presents dans la paroi musculaire des arteres; ces depots sont la consequence de la necrose des cellules musculaires surchargees de glycolipides. chez les sujets plus âges, aux lesions de la media s'associe une endarterite, et des alterations degeneratives glomerulaires et tubulaires apparaissent, probablement secondaires aux alterations vasculaires. la necrose des cellules mesangiales peut egalement intervenir dans la genese des lesions glomerulaires. nos observations chez les heterozygotes sont compatibles avec l'hypothese de m. lyon concernant l'inactivation d'un chromosome x dans chaque cellule feminine. elles suggerent l'existence d'une correlation etroite entre l'importance de la surcharge du parenchyme renal et le taux urinaire d'α-galactosidase. elles jettent un doute sur le benefice qu'on peut attendre des therapeutiques enzymatiques substitutives.
abstract despite the success of multidrug therapy in reducing the number of registered leprosy cases worldwide, evidence suggests that mycobacterium leprae continues to be transmitted. a serological diagnostic test capable of identifying and allowing treatment of early-stage disease could reduce transmission and prevent the onset of the disability, a common complication of the disease in later stages. serological diagnosis based on antibody recognition of phenolic glycolipid i (pgl-i) cannot reliably identify individuals with lower bacterial indices (bi). one strategy that might improve this situation is the provision of highly specific serological antigens that may be combined with pgl-i to improve the sensitivity of diagnosis. using serological expression cloning with a serum pool of untreated lepromatous leprosy (ll) patients, we identified 14 strongly reactive m. leprae proteins, 5 of which were previously unstudied. we present results suggesting that two of these proteins, ml0405 and ml2331, demonstrate the ability to specifically identify ll/borderline lepromatous (bl) patients on the basis of immunoglobulin g (igg) reactivity. in a household contact study, ll index cases were identified on the basis of this reactivity, while household contacts of these patients demonstrated undetectable reactivity. at a serum dilution of 1:800, suitable to reduce background pgl-i igm reactivity, two bl patients with a bi of <4 showed anti-human polyvalent immunoglobulin g, a, and m reactivity measured with a combination of ml0405, ml2331, and natural disaccharide o-linked human serum albumin (ndohsa) (synthetic pgl-i) that was markedly higher than igm reactivity to ndohsa alone. we suggest that ml0405 and ml2331 may have utility in serological leprosy diagnosis. nerve damage is the hallmark of mycobacterium leprae infection, which results from m. leprae invasion of the schwann cell of the peripheral nervous system. we have recently shown that the laminin-2 isoform, specially the g domain of laminin alpha2 chain, on the schwann cell-axon unit serves as an initial neural target for m. leprae. however, m. leprae surface molecules that mediate bacterial invasion of peripheral nerves are entirely unknown. by using human alpha2 laminins as a probe, a major 28-kda protein in the m. leprae cell wall fraction that binds alpha2 laminins was identified. after n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, pcr-based strategy was used to clone the gene that encodes this protein. deduced amino acid sequence of this m. leprae laminin-binding protein predicts a 21-kda molecule (ml-lbp21), which is smaller than the observed molecular size in sds/page. immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy on intact m. leprae with mabs against recombinant (r) ml-lbp21 revealed that the protein is surface exposed. rml-lbp21 avidly bound to alpha2 laminins, the rg domain of the laminin-alpha2 chain, and the native peripheral nerve laminin-2. the role of ml-lbp21 in schwann cell adhesion and invasion was investigated by using fluorescent polystyrene beads coated with rml-lbp21. although beads coated with rml-lbp21 alone specifically adhered to and were ingested by primary schwann cells, these functions were significantly enhanced when beads were preincubated with exogenous alpha2 laminins. taken together, the present data suggest that ml-lbp21 may function as a critical surface adhesin that facilitates the entry of m. leprae into schwann cells.
one adult male chimpanzee (pan troglodytes) was trained to detect a target area consisting of texture elements from the background texture made of the different elements from the target area. the subject was given eight different stimulus conditions. in condition 1, segregation was based on the difference of local feature of elements but not on global similarity. conditions 2-3 investigated the effects of the number of terminators, which was considered as 'textons' in human texture perception. the chimpanzee showed better performance when the discrimination can be based on the difference of the number of terminators. this tendency, however, was reversed when the local salient feature (length of shorter lines) was enhanced, as in enns' [15] study with humans as subjects. the subject showed asymmetries in segregation performance when discriminating based on gap (conditions 4-5), line length (condition 6), and regularity of line arrangement (condition 7). observed asymmetries were consistent with humans and with visual search asymmetries. the performance of texture segregation by the chimpanzee was consistent with humans, and the texture segregation is one of the useful tasks for comparative study of early vision as well as visual search task. if a region composed of one set of texture elements is effortlessly perceived on a background composed of another set, the texture segmentation is said to occur "preattentively". if the time required to find a target item among distractor items is independent of the number of distractor items, the visual search is said to occur with all items processed "in parallel". effortless, preattentive texture segmentation and parallel visual search are sometimes assumed to be equivalent measures of the same parallel processing stage in the visual system. the demonstrations presented here show that this is not the case. parallel processing can occur with stimuli that do not support effortless texture segmentation and vice versa.
conjugated linoleic acid (cla) modulates body composition, especially by reducing adipose tissue. however, despite the increasing knowledge about cla's beneficial effects on obesity management, the mechanism of action is not yet fully understood. furthermore, in some human studies fat loss is accompanied by impairment in insulin sensitivity, especially when using the trans-10,cis-12 isomer. the aim of this work was to study the effects of moderate doses of cla on body fat deposition, cytokine profile and inflammatory markers in mice. mice were orally treated with a mixture of cla isomers, cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 (50:50), for 35 days with doses of cla1 (0.15 g cla/kg body weight) and cla2 (0.5 g cla/kg body weight). cla had discrete effects on body weight but caused a clear reduction in fat mass (retroperitoneal and mesenteric as the most sensitive depots), although no other tissue weights were affected. glucose and insulin were not altered by cla treatment, and maintenance of glucose homeostasis was observed even under insulin overload. the study of gene expression (emr1, mcp-1, il-6, tnfalpha, ppargamma2 and inos) either in adipocytes and/or in the stromal vascular fraction indicated that cla does not lead to the infiltration of macrophages in adipose tissue or to the induction of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. the use of a mixture of both isomers, as well as moderate doses of cla, is able to induce a reduction of fat gain without an impairment of adipose tissue function while preserving insulin sensitivity. adipose tissue may be the source of insulin desensitizing proinflammatory molecules that predispose to insulin resistance. this study investigated whether dietary fatty acids could attenuate the proinflammatory insulin-resistant state in obese adipose tissue. the potential antidiabetic effect of cis-9, trans-11–conjugated linoleic acid (c9,t11-cla) was determined, focusing on the molecular markers of insulin sensitivity and inflammation in adipose tissue of ob/ob c57bl-6 mice. feeding a c9,t11-cla–enriched diet reduced fasting glucose (p < 0.05), insulin (p < 0.05), and triacylglycerol concentrations (p < 0.01) and increased adipose tissue plasma membrane glut4 (p < 0.05) and insulin receptor (p < 0.05) expression compared with the control linoleic acid–enriched diet. interestingly, after the c9,t11-cla diet, adipose tissue macrophage infiltration was less, with marked downregulation of several inflammatory markers in adipose tissue, including reduced tumor necrosis factor-α and cd68 mrna (p < 0.05), nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) p65 expression (p < 0.01), nf-κb dna binding (p < 0.01), and nf-κb p65, p50, c-rel, p52, and relb transcriptional activity (p < 0.01). to define whether these observations were direct effects of the nutrient intervention, complimentary cell culture studies showed that c9,t11-cla inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α–induced downregulation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and glut4 mrna expression and promoted insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3t3-l1 adipocytes compared with linoleic acid. this study suggests that altering fatty acid composition may attenuate the proinflammatory state in adipose tissue that predisposes to obesity-induced insulin resistance.
backgroundbacillus anthracis is a pathogen that causes life-threatening disease--anthrax. b. anthracis spores are highly resistant to extreme temperatures and harsh chemicals. inactivation of b. anthracis spores is important to ensure the environmental safety and public health. the 2001 bioterrorism attack involving anthrax spores has brought acute public attention and triggered extensive research on inactivation of b. anthracis spores. single-walled carbon nanotubes (swcnts) as a class of emerging nanomaterial have been reported as a strong antimicrobial agent. in addition, continuous near infrared (nir) radiation on swcnts induces excessive local heating which can enhance swcnts’ antimicrobial effect. in this study, we investigated the effects of swcnts coupled with nir treatment on bacillus anthracis spores.results and discussionthe results showed that the treatment of 10 μg/ml swcnts coupled with 20 min nir significantly improved the antimicrobial effect by doubling the percentage of viable spore number reduction compared with swcnts alone treatment (88% vs. 42%). at the same time, swcnts-nir treatment activated the germination of surviving spores and their dipicolinic acid (dpa) release during germination. the results suggested the dual effect of swcnts-nir treatment on b. anthracis spores: enhanced the sporicidal effect and stimulated the germination of surviving spores. molecular level examination showed that swcnts-nir increased the expression levels (>2-fold) in 3 out of 6 germination related genes tested in this study, which was correlated to the activated germination and dpa release. swcnts-nir treatment either induced or inhibited the expression of 3 regulatory genes detected in this study. when the nir treatment time was 5 or 25 min, there were 3 out of 7 virulence related genes that showed significant decrease on expression levels (>2 fold decrease).conclusionsthe results of this study demonstrated the dual effect of swcnts-nir treatment on b. anthracis spores, which enhanced the sporicidal effect and stimulated the germination of surviving spores. swcnts-nir treatment also altered the expression of germination, regulatory, and virulence-related genes in b. anthracis. the alanin‐estimulated spore germination responses of bacillus subtilis 168 have been dissected by combining physiological and genetical approaches. from the analyses the authors infer that there are three classes of alanine response. two of the responses are mediated via the gera proteins, with and without germinal adjuncts, the third is mediated via the gerb proteins and obligately requires adjuncts.
the temporally graded memory impairment seen in many neurobehavioral disorders implies different neuroanatomical pathways and/or cognitive mechanisms involved in storage and retrieval of memories of different ages. a dynamic interaction between medial-temporal and neocortical brain regions has been proposed to account for memory's greater permanence with time. despite considerable debate concerning its time-dependent role in memory retrieval, medial-temporal lobe activity has been well studied. however, the relative participation of neocortical regions in recent and remote memory retrieval has received much less attention. using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate robust, temporally graded signal differences in posterior cingulate, right middle frontal, right fusiform, and left middle temporal regions in healthy older adults during famous name identification from two disparate time epochs. importantly, no neocortical regions demonstrated greater response to older than to recent stimuli. our results suggest a possible role of these neocortical regions in temporally dating items in memory and in establishing and maintaining memory traces throughout the lifespan. theoretical implications of these findings for the two dominant models of remote memory functioning (consolidation theory and multiple trace theory) are discussed. the aim of this study was to determine the role of regional cortical thickness in recall of verbal material over an extended time period. mri scans of healthy adults of varying ages were obtained. two scans were averaged per person to achieve high spatial resolution, and a semi-automated method for continuous measurement of thickness across the entire cortical mantle was employed. verbal memory tests assessing recall after 5 min, 30 min, and a mean interval of 83 days were administered. a general linear model (glm) of the effects of thickness at each vertex on the different memory indices was computed, controlling for gender, age, iq, and intracranial volume. these analyses were repeated with hippocampal volume as an additional variable to be controlled for, to assess to which extent effects of cortical thickness were independent of hippocampal size. minute effects of cortical thickness were observed with regard to shorter time intervals (5 and 30 min). however, even when controlling for the effects of hippocampal volume, higher recall across months was associated with thicker cortex of distinct areas including parts of the gyrus rectus, the middle frontal gyrus, the parieto-occipital sulcus and the lingual gyrus of both hemispheres. in addition, hemisphere-specific associations were found in parts of the right temporal and parietal lobe as well as parts of the left precuneus. this supports a unique and critical role of the thickness of distinct cortical areas in recall after months, more than after minutes.
monitoring the water quality of recreational beaches is only one step toward understanding microbial contamination -- the primary cause of beach closings. the surf zone sediment reservoir is typically overlooked and may also be important. this study involved monitoring the fecal indicator bacteria (fib) levels in water and sediment at three ocean beaches (two exposed and one enclosed) during a storm event, conducting laboratory microcosm experiments with sediment from these beaches, and surveying sediment fib levels at 13 beaches (some exposed and some enclosed). peaks in escherichia coli and enterococci concentrations in water and sediment coincided with storm activity at the two exposed beaches, while levels of both fib were consistently high and irregular at the enclosed beach. results from microcosm experiments showing similar, dramatic growth of fib in both overlying water and sediment from all beaches, as well as results from the beach survey, support the hypothesis that the quiescent environment rather than sediment characteristics can explain the elevated sediment fib levels observed at enclosed beaches. this work has implications for the predictive value of fib measurements, and points to the importance of the sediment reservoir. waters adjacent to the county of los angeles (ca) receive untreated runoff from a series of storm drains year round. many other coastal areas face a similar situation. to our knowledge, there has not been a large-scale epidemiologic study of persons who swim in marine waters subject to such runoff. we report here results of a cohort study conducted to investigate this issue. measures of exposure included distance from the storm drain, selected bacterial indicators (total and fecal coliforms, enterococci, and escherichia coli), and a direct measure of enteric viruses. we found higher risks of a broad range of symptoms, including both upper respiratory and gastrointestinal, for subjects swimming (a) closer to storm drains, (b) in water with high levels of single bacterial indicators and a low ratio of total to fecal coliforms, and (c) in water where enteric viruses were detected. the strength and consistency of the associations we observed across various measures of exposure imply that there may be an increased risk of adverse health outcomes associated with swimming in ocean water that is contaminated with untreated urban runoff.
protein 4.1g (4.1g) is a widely expressed member of the protein 4.1 family of membrane skeletal proteins. we have previously reported that ca2+-saturated calmodulin (ca2+/cam) modulates 4.1g interactions with transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins through binding to four.one-ezrin–radixin–moesin (4.1g ferm) domain and n-terminal headpiece region (ghp). here we identify a novel mechanism of ca2+/cam-mediated regulation of 4.1g interactions using a combination of small-angle x-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and circular dichroism spectroscopy analyses. we document that ghp intrinsically disordered coiled structure switches to a stable compact structure upon binding of ca2+/cam. this dramatic conformational change of ghp inhibits in turn 4.1g ferm domain interactions due to steric hindrance. based upon sequence homologies with the ca2+/cam-binding motif in protein 4.1r headpiece region, we establish that the 4.1g s71rgisrfippwlkkqks peptide (pepg) mediates ca2+/cam binding. as observed for ghp, the random coiled structure of pepg changes to a relaxed globular shape upon complex formation with ca2+/cam. the resilient coiled structure of pepg, maintained even in the presence of trifluoroethanol, singles it out from any previously published cam-binding peptide. taken together, these results show that ca2+/cam binding to ghp, and more specifically to pepg, has profound effects on other functional domains of 4.1g. red blood cell protein 4.1 (4.1r) is essential for maintaining erythrocyte shape and controlling membrane mechanical properties, such as deformability and stability. the importance of 4.1r has been demonstrated by the dramatic erythrocyte alterations observed in patients lacking this protein. indeed, 4.1r null red blood cells adopt an elliptical shape and are characterized by unstable membranes. the key role of 4.1r likely results from multiple protein-protein interactions: lateral interactions with the spectrin/actin network and vertical interactions with the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane proteins glycophorin c (gpc), band 3 (anion exchanger 1, ae1), and cd44. 4.1r promotes the formation of a ternary complex with gpc and p55 through its 30 kda membrane-binding domain. based on the primary structure of the prototypical 80 kda isoform of 4.1r, functional domains and sites for binding partners have been identified. the others and we have been focusing on the structure and function of the 30 kda nh2-terminal domain of 4.1r, which is responsible for 4.1r interaction with the transmembrane proteins described above. a major finding is that ca2+, in association with calmodulin (cam), plays a critical role in regulation of the interaction of the 30 kda domain with its various binding partners. this review is a detailed report of our current knowledge regarding 4.1r, and more specifically, 4.1r 30 kda domain: its primary structure, functions and modulation by ca2+ and cam. emphasis is given on the relationships between structure and function that we have been able to establish through x-ray crystal structure analysis of the 30 kda membrane-binding domain in 4.1r. finally, we give insights into the potential roles of 4.1r in the dynamic organization of the membrane skeleton viewed as a complex system.
directed evolution can be a powerful tool for revealing the mutational pathways that lead to more resistant bacterial strains. in this study, we focused on the bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is resistant to members of the β-lactam class of antibiotics and thus continues to pose a major public health threat. resistance of this organism is the result of a chromosomally encoded, extended spectrum class a β-lactamase, blac, that is constitutively produced. here, combinatorial enzyme libraries were selected on ampicillin to identify mutations that increased resistance of bacteria to β-lactams. after just a single round of mutagenesis and selection, blac mutants were evolved that conferred 5-fold greater antibiotic resistance to cells and enhanced the catalytic efficiency of blac by 3-fold compared to the wild-type enzyme. all isolated mutants carried a mutation at position 105 (e.g., i105f) that appears to widen access to the active site by 3.6 å while also stabilizing the reorganized topology. in light of these findings, we propose that i105 is a ‘gatekeeper’ residue of the active site that regulates substrate hydrolysis by blac. moreover, our results suggest that directed evolution can provide insight into the development of highly drug resistant microorganisms. proteins are transported across the bacterial plasma membrane and the chloroplast thylakoid membrane by means of protein translocases that recognize n-terminal targeting signals in their cognate substrates. transport of many of these proteins involves the well defined sec apparatus that operates in both membranes. we describe here the identification of a novel component of a bacterial sec-independent translocase. the system probably functions in a similar manner to a sec-independent translocase in the thylakoid membrane, and substrates for both systems bear a characteristic twin-arginine motif in the targeting peptide. the translocase component is encoded inescherichia coli by an unassigned reading frame,yigu, disruption of which blocks the export of at least five twin-arg-containing precursor proteins that are predicted to bind redox cofactors, and hence fold, prior to translocation. the sec pathway remains unaffected in the deletion strain. the gene has been designated tatc (for twin-argininetranslocation), and we show that homologous genes are present in a range of bacteria, plastids, and mitochondria. these findings suggest a central role for tatc-type proteins in the translocation of tightly folded proteins across a spectrum of biological membranes.
background a course of combination therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid (ics) and a long-acting β(2) agonist (laba) for asthma can improve lung function, asthma symptoms and reduce exacerbations. because both medicinal substance and inhalation devices are associated with clinical efficacy, each ics/laba combination may have different features. this study aimed to compare the effects of two widely available formulations, budesonide/formoterol (bud/fm) delivered by a turbuhaler(®), and fluticasone/salmeterol (fp/sm) delivered by a diskus(®), on small airway function and airway inflammation.   methods asthmatic patients (n = 40) treated twice daily with fp/sm 250/50 μg with forced expiratory volume in 1 s values controlled above 80% of the predicted normal but with suspected persistent airway inflammation and small airway impairment were enrolled in the study. patients were randomized into two groups, receiving either twice daily bud/fm 320/9 μg or fp/sm 250/50 μg, and treatment efficacy was compared after 4 weeks. outcomes included impulse oscillometry (ios), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (feno), spirometry and asthma control questionnaire (acq) scores.   results patients in the bud/fm group showed significant improvements in their ios and spirometry parameters of small airway function, feno values and acq scores, compared with the fp/sm group. there were good correlations between ios parameters, feno and acq score changes over the course of the treatment.   conclusions bud/fm twice daily significantly improved small airway impairment and airway inflammation in asthmatic patients, leading to a reduction in asthma symptoms and achievement of good asthma control. in addition, improvement of small airway function may improve airway inflammation and/or lead to better controlled asthma. aims evidence is accumulating that budesonide (bud) forms intracellular esters in airways. which may affect both duration of action and therapeutic ratio of this drug. the aim of the present paper is to review the preclinical and human experimental evidence supporting the esterification of bud, and to discuss the clinical implications this may have on asthma and rhinitis treatment.   results after inhalation, intact bud binds primarily to available steroid receptors, and mainly excess (unbound) bud is esterified. esterification of bud is a rapid process: within 20 minutes of inhalation in the rat of radiolabeled bud, approximately 80% of radioactivity within the trachea and main bronchi was associated with bud esters, primarily bud oleate. after 4 hours, the proportion of bud esters/total cellular bud was typically 40 to 50% for lung, 70 to 90% for trachea, and only 10 to 15% for peripheral muscle. comparative in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that esterification prolongs bud's anti-inflammatory activity longer than that of corticosteroids that can not form esters. clinical studies have confirmed the prolonged presence of bud esters, as well as intact bud, in human airway tissues: 6 hours postdosing, nasal biopsy concentrations of intact bud were >10-fold greater than those of fluticasone propionate and at 24 hours bud was detectable in threefold more biopsies than fluticasone propionate. the impact of esterification on airway selectivity of bud has also been demonstrated in vivo and using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models.   conclusions bud is retained in airways as esters, a novel kinetic mechanism for synthetic glucocorticoids. in preclinical studies this esterification is correlated to a prolonged local tissue binding and efficacy, which is not found when the esterification is inhibited by an esterification blocker. because less esters are formed in the systemic compartment than in airways/lung, the local benefit:systemic risk ratio may also be improved by this mechanism. bud possesses favorable clinical properties, including its approved once-daily efficacy in asthma, which is probably in part attributable to esterification. however, a direct proof of the latter in patients requires effective and safe inhibitors of the esterification, which are not yet available. therefore, evidence to support the therapeutic impact of esterification is still circumstantial.
the transition from brief bursts of synchronous population activity characteristic of interictal epileptiform discharges (ieds) to more prolonged epochs of population activity characteristic of seizures (ictal-like activity) was recorded in juvenile rat hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slices and hippocampal slices using multiple-site extracellular electrodes. epileptiform activity was elicited by either increased extracellular potassium or 4-ap. ieds originated in the ca3 a-b region and spread bidirectionally into ca1 and ca3c dentate gyrus. the transition from ieds to ictal-like sustained epileptiform activity was reliably preceded by (1) increase in ied propagation velocity, (2) increase in ied secondary afterdischarges and their reverberation between ca3a and ca3c, and (3) shift in the ied initiation area from ca3 a-b to ca3c. ictal-like sustained network oscillations (10-20 hz) originated in ca3c and spread to ca1. the pattern of hippocampal ictal-like activity was unaffected by removal of the entorhinal cortex. these findings indicate that interictal and ictal activity can originate in the same neural network, and that the transition from interictal to ictal-like-sustained activity is preceded by predictable alterations in the origin and spread of ieds. these findings elucidate new targets for investigating the proximate causes, prediction, and treatment of seizures. on the basis of neuroanatomical studies, the entorhinal cortex (ec) has long been regarded as a relay station that provides the major source of afferent input to the hippocampus. the perforant path input to the dentate gyrus from layer ii has traditionally been regarded as the major pathway by which information is transferred. however, electrophysiological studies are now indicating that other elements of the perforant path that project directly to ca1 and ca3 are more important than thought previously, and that the properties of different neuronal elements in the ec may determine the way in which information is passed on to and processed by the hippocampus. this article summarizes some of the properties of synaptic transmission in the ec and speculates on how frequency-dependent changes in transmission may be involved in the pre- and post-processing of hippocampal information by the ec.
study hypothesis cellular aging of the egg following ovulation, also known as post-ovulatory aging, is associated with aberrant cortical mechanics and actomyosin cytoskeleton functions.   study finding post-ovulatory aging is associated with dysfunction of non-muscle myosin-ii, and pharmacologically induced myosin-ii dysfunction produces some of the same deficiencies observed in aged eggs.   what is known already reproductive success is reduced with delayed fertilization and when copulation or insemination occurs at increased times after ovulation. post-ovulatory aged eggs have several abnormalities in the plasma membrane and cortex, including reduced egg membrane receptivity to sperm, aberrant sperm-induced cortical remodeling and formation of fertilization cones at the site of sperm entry, and reduced ability to establish a membrane block to prevent polyspermic fertilization.   study design, samples/materials, methods ovulated mouse eggs were collected at 21-22 h post-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hcg) (aged eggs) or at 13-14 h post-hcg (young eggs), or young eggs were treated with the myosin light chain kinase (mlck) inhibitor ml-7, to test the hypothesis that disruption of myosin-ii function could mimic some of the effects of post-ovulatory aging. eggs were subjected to various analyses. cytoskeletal proteins in eggs and parthenogenesis were assessed using fluorescence microscopy, with further analysis of cytoskeletal proteins in immunoblotting experiments. cortical tension was measured through micropipette aspiration assays. egg membrane receptivity to sperm was assessed in in vitro fertilization (ivf) assays. membrane topography was examined by low-vacuum scanning electron microscopy (sem).   main results and the role of chance aged eggs have decreased levels and abnormal localizations of phosphorylated myosin-ii regulatory light chain (pmrlc; p = 0.0062). cortical tension, which is mediated in part by myosin-ii, is reduced in aged mouse eggs when compared with young eggs, by ∼40% in the cortical region where the metaphase ii spindle is sequestered and by ∼50% in the domain to which sperm bind and fuse (p < 0.0001). aging-associated parthenogenesis is partly rescued by treating eggs with a zinc ionophore (p = 0.003), as is parthenogenesis induced by inhibition of mitogen-activated kinase (mapk) 3/1 [also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk)1/2] or mlck. inhibition of mlck with ml-7 also results in effects that mimic those of post-ovulatory aging: fertilized ml-7-treated eggs show both impaired fertilization and increased extents of polyspermy, and ml-7-treated young eggs have several membrane abnormalities that are shared by post-ovulatory aged eggs.   limitations, reasons for caution these studies were done with mouse oocytes, and it remains to be fully determined how these findings from mouse oocytes would compare with other species. for studies using methods not amenable to analysis of large sample sizes and data are limited to what images one can capture (e.g. sem), data should be interpreted conservatively.   wider implications of the findings these data provide insights into causes of reproductive failures at later post-copulatory times.   large scale data not applicable.   study funding and competing interests this project was supported by r01 hd037696 and r01 hd045671 from the nih to j.p.e. cortical tension studies were supported by r01 gm66817 to d.n.r. the authors declare there are no financial conflicts of interest. analysis of mouse oocyte mechanics shows that effective tension drops 6-fold from prophase i to metaphase ii; the metaphase ii egg has a 2.5-fold tension differential between the cortex over the spindle and the opposite cortex. manipulation of actin, myosin-ii, or erms alters tension levels and induces spindle abnormalities during meiosis ii.
aims this study sought to investigate the 2-year outcomes of patients treated with the paclitaxel-eluting taxus((r)) stent (pes) or vascular brachytherapy (vbt), the previous 'gold standard therapy', for bare metal stent in-stent restenosis (isr).   methods and results in the taxus v-isr trial, 396 patients with bare metal stent isr referred for percutaneous coronary intervention were prospectively randomized to either pes or beta source vbt. the present analysis reports 24-month clinical outcomes from that study. between 9 and 24 months, ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularization tended to be required less frequently with assignment to pes compared to vbt (5.3 vs. 10.3%, p = .07). as a result, ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularization at 24 months was significantly reduced with pes compared with vbt (10.1 vs. 21.6%, p = 0.003), as was ischaemia-driven target vessel revascularization (18.1 vs. 27.5%, p = .03). there were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel thrombosis either between 12 and 24 months, or cumulative to 24 months.   conclusion freedom from clinical restenosis at 2 years is significantly enhanced after pes placement compared with vbt for bare metal stent isr, with similar rates of death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel thrombosis. background treatment of in-stent restenosis presents a critical limitation of intracoronary stent implantation. ionizing radiation has been shown to decrease neointimal formation within stents in animal models and in initial clinical trials. we studied the effects of intracoronary gamma-radiation therapy versus placebo on the clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients with in-stent restenosis.   methods and results one hundred thirty patients with in-stent restenosis underwent successful coronary intervention and were then blindly randomized to receive either intracoronary gamma-radiation with (192)ir (15 gy) or placebo. four independent core laboratories blinded to the treatment protocol analyzed the angiographic and intravascular ultrasound end points of restenosis. procedural success and in-hospital and 30-day complications were similar among the groups. at 6 months, patients assigned to radiation therapy required less target lesion revascularization and target vessel revascularization (9 [13.8%] and 17 [26.2%], respectively) compared with patients assigned to placebo (41 [63.1%, p=0.0001] and 44 [67.7%, p=0.0001], respectively). binary angiographic restenosis was lower in the irradiated group (19% versus 58% for placebo, p=0.001). freedom from major cardiac events was lower in the radiation group (29.2% versus 67.7% for placebo, p<0.001).   conclusions intracoronary gamma-radiation used as adjunct therapy for patients with in-stent restenosis significantly reduces both angiographic and clinical restenosis.
previous studies in the auditory cortex of mongolian gerbils on discrimination learning of the direction of frequency-modulated tones (fms) revealed that long-term memory formation involves activation of the dopaminergic system, activity of the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor), and protein synthesis. this led to the hypothesis that the dopaminergic system might modulate memory formation via regulation of mtor, which is implicated in translational control. here, we report that the d1/d5 dopamine receptor agonist skf-38393 substantially improved gerbils’ fm discrimination learning when administered systemically or locally into the auditory cortex shortly before, shortly after, or 1 day before conditioning. although acquisition performance during initial training was normal, the discrimination of fms was enhanced during retraining performed hours or days after agonist injection compared with vehicle-injected controls. the d1/d5 receptor antagonist sch-23390, the mtor inhibitor rapamycin, and the protein synthesis blocker anisomycin suppressed this effect. by immunohistochemistry, d1 dopamine receptors were identified in the gerbil auditory cortex predominantly in the infragranular layers. together, these findings suggest that in the gerbil auditory cortex dopaminergic inputs regulate mtor-mediated, protein synthesis-dependent mechanisms, thus controlling for hours or days the consolidation of memory required for the discrimination of complex auditory stimuli. bilateral rapid‐rate transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) of gerbil auditory cortex with a miniature coil device was used to study short‐term and long‐term effects on discrimination learning of frequency‐modulated tones. we found previously that directional discrimination of frequency modulation (rising vs. falling) relies on auditory cortex processing and that formation of its memory depends on local protein synthesis. here we show that, during training over 5 days, certain rtms regimes contingent on training had differential effects on the time course of learning. when rtms was applied several times per day, i.e. four blocks of 5 min rtms each followed 5 min later by a 3‐min training block and 15‐min intervals between these blocks (experiment a), animals reached a high discrimination performance more slowly over 5 days than did controls. when rtms preceded only the first two of four training blocks (experiment b), or when prolonged rtms (20 min) preceded only the first block, or when blocks of experiment a had longer intervals (experiments c and d), no significant day‐to‐day effects were found. however, in experiment a, and to some extent in experiment b, rtms reduced the within‐session discrimination performance. nevertheless the animals learned, as demonstrated by a higher performance the next day. thus, our results indicate that rtms treatments accumulate over a day but not strongly over successive days. we suggest that rtms of sensory cortex, as used in our study, affects short‐term memory but not long‐term memory formation.
the ubiquitous use of social networking sites by students and the potential impacts of such use on academic performance are of both theoretical and practical importance. hence, this paper addresses the question: how does the use of social networking sites influence academic performance? the present review synthesizes the empirical findings of the extant literature, via a systematic review, that examines the efforts that have been made to explicate the association between the use of social networking sites and academic performance. the review of 23 peer-reviewed papers highlights mixed findings regarding the relationship between social network use and academic performance—serving as a call for further research. the quantitative study to explore the most popular amongst saudi students.the study establishes relation among the social media usage and academic grades.poor time management and football also have negative impact on academic grades.normality tests are to find relationship among social media usage and gpa scores.the hypothesis about existence of relationship among gpa and sn is not satisfied. social media is a popular method for communication amongst university students in saudi arabia. however excessive social media use can raise questions about whether academic performance is affected. this research explores this question by conducting a survey on university students in saudi arabia in regards to social media usage and their academic performance. the survey also explored which social network is the most popular amongst saudi students, what students thought about their social media usage and factors besides social media usage which negatively affect academic performance.the survey received 108 responses and descriptive statistics including normality tests i.e. scatter plots were used to examine the relationship between the average number of hours students spent of social media a week and gpa scores of the students. the results demonstrated that there was no linear relationship between social media usage in a week and gpa score. students highlighted that besides social media use, time management is a factor which affects students 'studies negatively.the findings of the paper can be used to propose the effective plans for improving the academic performance of the students in such a way that a balance in the leisure, information exchange and academic performance can be maintained.
the loss of atrx impairs dna repair, promoting glioma growth but enhancing sensitivity to dna-damaging therapies. aggressive gliomas’ achilles’ heel atrx is a protein that is often mutated in glioma, a lethal and relatively common brain tumor. koschmann et al. developed a mouse model of atrx-deficient glioma and discovered that these tumors grow more aggressively than their counterparts with wild-type atrx. the reason this happens is that the loss of atrx impairs dna repair, resulting in genetically unstable tumors that can accumulate oncogenic mutations more quickly. however, because of their dna repair defect, these tumors also proved to be more sensitive to treatments that damage the dna, such as radiation and some types of chemotherapy. consistent with these findings, the presence of atrx mutation correlated with better outcomes in patients, because these tumors were more susceptible to treatment. recent work in human glioblastoma (gbm) has documented recurrent mutations in the histone chaperone protein atrx. we developed an animal model of atrx-deficient gbm and showed that loss of atrx reduces median survival and increases genetic instability. further, analysis of genome-wide data for human gliomas showed that atrx mutation is associated with increased mutation rate at the single-nucleotide variant (snv) level. in mouse tumors, atrx deficiency impairs nonhomologous end joining and increases sensitivity to dna-damaging agents that induce double-stranded dna breaks. we propose that atrx loss results in a genetically unstable tumor, which is more aggressive when left untreated but is more responsive to double-stranded dna-damaging agents, resulting in improved overall survival. glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) is a lethal brain tumour in adults and children. however, dna copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases. to explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric gbm samples. somatic mutations in the h3.3-atrx-daxx chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). recurrent mutations in h3f3a, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant h3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (k27m, g34r/g34v) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. mutations in atrx (α-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome x-linked) and daxx (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for h3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a g34r or g34v h3.3 mutation. somatic tp53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with h3f3a and/or atrx mutations. screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n = 784) showed h3f3a mutations to be specific to gbm and highly prevalent in children and young adults. furthermore, the presence of h3f3a/atrx-daxx/tp53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. this is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult gbm pathogenesis.
e-cadherin has been linked to the suppression of tumor growth and the inhibition of cell proliferation in culture. we observed that progressively decreasing the seeding density of normal rat kidney-52e (nrk52e) or mcf-10a epithelial cells from confluence, indeed, released cells from growth arrest. unexpectedly, a further decrease in seeding density so that cells were isolated from neighboring cells decreased proliferation. experiments using microengineered substrates showed that e-cadherin engagement stimulated the peak in proliferation at intermediate seeding densities, and that the proliferation arrest at high densities did not involve e-cadherin, but rather resulted from a crowding-dependent decrease in cell spreading against the underlying substrate. rac1 activity, which was induced by e-cadherin engagement specifically at intermediate seeding densities, was required for the cadherin-stimulated proliferation, and the control of rac1 activation by e-cadherin was mediated by p120catenin. together, these findings demonstrate a stimulatory role for ecadherin in proliferative regulation, and identify a simple mechanism by which cell–cell contact may trigger or inhibit epithelial cell proliferation in different settings. comments copyright the rockefeller university press. this research was originally published in the journal of cell biology, volume 173, issue 3, may 8, 2006, pages 431-441. this journal article is available at scholarlycommons: http://repository.upenn.edu/be_papers/72 t h e j o u r n a l o f c e l l b io l o g y jcb: article © the rockefeller university press $8.00 the journal of cell biology, vol. 173, no. 3, may 8, 2006 431–441 http://www.jcb.org/cgi/doi/10.1083/jcb.200510087 jcb 43 conclusionscontact inhibition of movement is here defined simply as the stopping of the continued locomotion of a cell in the direction which has produced a collision with another cell; so that one cell does not use another as a substratum. amongst fibroblasts and epithelial cells this inhibition seems to be brought about by a mechanism which it is suggested consists essentially of a spasm of contraction in the region of the contact, set off by some signal from the cell contacted. many other kinds of cells show the general phenomenon of contact inhibition; but there is no certainty that they have the same contractile mechanism.the survey of the literature which this review has entailed suggests that it might be useful to end with four somewhat negative points: (1) contact inhibition as originally defined is not concerned with mitosis. it may of course become so. (2) contact inhibition of movement is difficult to analyse reliably without quantitative estimations and deliberate experiments. anecdotes are not enough. (3) malignant cells are not properly described as being devoid of contact inhibition. it is suggested that they are defective as compared with their cells of origin. (4) from the point of view invasion interest. it is the heterologous inhibition of tumour cells by normal cells that is relevant.
backgroundwaist circumference has been identified as a valuable predictor of cardiovascular risk in children. the development of waist circumference percentiles and cut-offs for various ethnic groups are necessary because of differences in body composition. the purpose of this study was to develop waist circumference percentiles for chinese children and to explore optimal waist circumference cut-off values for predicting cardiovascular risk factors clustering in this population.methodsheight, weight, and waist circumference were measured in 5529 children (2830 boys and 2699 girls) aged 6-12 years randomly selected from southern and northern china. blood pressure, fasting triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose were obtained in a subsample (n = 1845). smoothed percentile curves were produced using the lms method. receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to derive the optimal age- and gender-specific waist circumference thresholds for predicting the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors.resultsgender-specific waist circumference percentiles were constructed. the waist circumference thresholds were at the 90th and 84th percentiles for chinese boys and girls respectively, with sensitivity and specificity ranging from 67% to 83%. the odds ratio of a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors among boys and girls with a higher value than cut-off points was 10.349 (95% confidence interval 4.466 to 23.979) and 8.084 (95% confidence interval 3.147 to 20.767) compared with their counterparts.conclusionspercentile curves for waist circumference of chinese children are provided. the cut-off point for waist circumference to predict cardiovascular risk factors clustering is at the 90th and 84th percentiles for chinese boys and girls, respectively. objective: the objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that differences in the relationship between percent body fat (%bf) and body mass index (bmi) between populations can be explained (in part) by differences in body build.design: cross-sectional, comparative study.subjects: 120 age, gender and bmi matched singapore chinese, beijing chinese and dutch (wageningen) caucasians.measurements: from body weight and body height, bmi was calculated. relative sitting height (sitting height/height) was used as a measure of relative leg length. body fat was determined using densitometry (underwater weighing) in beijing and wageningen and using a three-compartment model based on densitometry and hydrometry in singapore. wrist and knee widths were measured as indicators for frame size and skeletal mass was calculated based on height, wrist and knee width. in addition, a slenderness index (height/sum of wrist and knee width) was calculated.results: for the same bmi, singapore chinese had the highest %bf followed by beijing chinese and the dutch caucasians. singaporean chinese had a more slender frame than beijing chinese and dutch caucasians. predicted %bf from bmi, using a caucasian prediction formula, was not different from measured %bf in wageningen and in beijing, but in singapore the formula underpredicted %bf by 4.0±0.8% (mean±s.e.m.) compared to wageningen. the difference between measured and predicted %bf (bias) was related to the level of %bf and with measures of body build, especially slenderness. correction for differences in %bf, slenderness and relative sitting height, decreased the differences between measured and predicted values compared to the dutch group from 1.4±0.8 (not statistically significant, ns) to −0.2±0.5 (ns) in beijing and from 4.0±0.8 (p<0.05) to 0.3±0.5 (ns) in singapore (all values mean±s.e.m.).conclusions: the study results confirm the hypothesis that differences in body build are at least partly responsible for a different relationship between bmi and %bf among different (ethnic) groups.
purpose to assess the diagnostic efficacy of macular and peripapillary retinal thickness measurements for the staging of diabetic retinopathy (dr) and the prediction of disease progression. methods in this prospective study, 149 diabetic patients (149 eyes) and 50 non-diabetic control subjects were included. baseline optical coherence tomography was employed to measure retinal thickness in the macula (horizontal, vertical, and central) and the peripapillary zone (superior, inferior, nasal, and concentric to the optic disc). seven baseline parameters were correlated with the dr stages identified by fluorescein angiography. baseline retinal thickness was compared between groups of patients requiring panretinal photocoagulation (prp) within 6 months (prp group) and patients not requiring prp (no-prp group). results macular and peripapillary retinal thicknesses in diabetic subjects were significantly greater than that in normal controls (p<0.05). all retinal thickness parameters, and particularly peripapillary circular scans, tended to increase with increasing dr severity (p<0.05). the baseline thicknesses of the peripapillary circular scans were greater in the prp group than in the no-prp group (p<0.05). conclusions peripapillary retinal thickness may prove to be a useful criterion for dr severity and may also serve as an indicator of disease progression. purpose to assess the correlation between the features of optical coherence tomography (oct) and fluorescein angiography in clinically significant diabetic macular edema.   design retrospective observational case series.   methods this study involved 145 eyes (91 patients) with clinically significant diabetic macular edema. the fluorescein angiography features were categorized into focal leakage type, diffuse leakage type, and diffuse cystoid leakage type. the oct features were categorized into four types: type 1, thickening with homogeneous optical reflectivity; type 2, thickening with markedly decreased optical reflectivity in the outer retinal layer; type 3a, foveolar detachment without traction; and type 3b, foveolar detachment with apparent vitreofoveal traction. the correlation between fluorescein angiography types and oct types were analyzed, and their associations with visual acuity, central foveal thickness. and stages of diabetic retinopathy were evaluated.   results the prevalence of oct type 1 was higher in the focal leakage type (73.0%) and in the diffuse leakage type (58.9%) than in the diffuse cystoid leakage type (3.8%) of fluorescein angiography (p <.0001). the prevalence of oct type 2 and 3a was higher in the diffuse cystoid leakage type (57.7% and 34.6%, respectively) than in the focal leakage type (20.6% and 3.2%) or diffuse leakage type(28.6% and 10.7%; p <.0001). the stages of retinopathy correlated with fluorescein angiography types (p =.016). optical coherence tomography type 1 and the focal leakage type of fluorescein angiography showed the least foveal thickness and the best visual acuity (p <.05).   conclusions there was a significant correlation between the features of oct and fluorescein angiography in clinically significant diabetic macular edema. the combined data from both oct and fluorescein angiography may provide a clearer understanding of the anatomic and physiologic characteristics of clinically significant diabetic macular edema.
purpose to investigate the effects of unilateral isokinetic exercises on the one-legged standing balance of the contralateral lower extremity.   subjects a volunteer sample of 32 healthy adults (12 men and 20 women) was randomized to training and control groups.   methods the training group received unilateral hip isokinetic exercises of the dominant leg for two weeks. contralateral single-limb balance was measured before and after intervention, including three stability index scores of balance using biodex stability system: anterior-posterior stability index (apsi), medio-lateral stability index (mlsi), and overall stability index (osi) scores.   results comparison of pre-test and post-test data revealed significant improvements in apsi, mlsi, and osi scores in the training group (p<0.05), but not in the control group. the gains of stability scores from pre- to post-test, were also significantly greater (p<0.05) in the training group than the control group.   conclusion these results suggest that contralateral training with unilateral isokinetic exercises increases the one-legged standing balance of the contralateral limb following a short duration of training. the aim of this study was to evaluate balance abilities and electromyographic (emg) latency times of the preferred and nonpreferred leg in soccer players. whereas side differences between the two legs in force, kicking speed, and joint laxity have been demonstrated in athletes in previous studies, no data are so far available on balance differences. low balance ability is generally associated with an increased risk of ligament injuries, and the detection of a possible asymmetry in balance is important because a bilateral difference may be a contributing factor to injury. twenty-one amateur soccer players were tested. two different balance test instruments were used: the biodex stability system and the tetrax system. for the evaluation of muscle latency times, emgs were recorded by means of the equitest system. none of the tests performed in this study revealed statistically significant differences in balance ability between the preferred and the nonpreferred leg. the investigations of balance function and muscle response in amateur soccer players did not reveal significant differences between the preferred and nonpreferred leg in the current study. however, a certain tendency to better balance in the nonpreferred leg was observed.
uridine 5′-diphosphate (udp) plays an important role in controlling vascular tone; however, udp-mediated response in metabolic syndromes, including obesity and type 2 diabetes in females, remains unclear. in this study, we investigated udp-mediated response in the aorta of female obese otsuka long–evans tokushima fatty (oletf) rats and control long–evans tokushima otsuka (leto) rats. in oletf rat aortas precontracted by phenylephrine (pe) (vs. leto), (1) udp-induced relaxation was increased, whereas acetylcholine (ach)-induced relaxation was decreased; (2) no udp- or ach-induced relaxations were observed in endothelial denudation, whereas udp-induced small contraction was observed; and (3) ng-nitro-l-arginine [l-nna, a nitric oxide (no) synthase inhibitor] eliminated udp-induced relaxation and small contraction, whereas caused contrasting responses by ach, including slight relaxations (leto) and contractions (oletf). indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, eliminated the difference in udp- and ach-induced relaxations between the groups by increased udp-induced relaxation in the leto group and increased ach-induced relaxation in the oletf group. mrs2578, a p2y6 receptor antagonist, eliminated the difference in udp-induced relaxations between the groups by decreasing udp-induced relaxation in the oletf group. mrs2578 had no effect on udp-induced contraction in endothelium-denuded aortas. therefore, these findings demonstrate opposite trends of relaxations by udp and ach in oletf and leto rat aortas. these differences may be attributed to the imbalance between no and vasoconstrictor prostanoids upon stimulations. increased udp-induced relaxation in oletf rat aorta may be caused by the activation of endothelial mrs2578-sensitive p2y6 receptor. vascular dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the development of systemic complications associated with arterial hypertension and diabetes. the endothelium, or more specifically, various factors derived from endothelial cells tightly regulate vascular function, including vascular tone. in physiological conditions, there is a balance between endothelium‐derived factors, that is, relaxing factors (endothelium‐derived relaxing factors; edrfs) and contracting factors (endothelium‐derived contracting factors; edcfs), which mediate vascular homeostasis. however, in disease states, such as diabetes and arterial hypertension, there is an imbalance between edrf and edcf, with a reduction of edrf signalling and an increase of edcf signalling. among edcfs, cox‐derived vasoconstrictor prostanoids play an important role in the development of vascular dysfunction associated with hypertension and diabetes. moreover, uridine adenosine tetraphosphate (up4a), identified as an edcf in 2005, also modulates vascular function. however, the role of up4a in hypertension‐ and diabetes‐associated vascular dysfunction is unclear. in the present review, we focused on experimental and clinical evidence that implicate these two edcfs (vasoconstrictor prostanoids and up4a) in vascular dysfunction associated with hypertension and diabetes.

- adaptations of the aging left ventricle (lv) to hemodynamic overload are functionally and structurally distinct from those of the young organism. this study describes the influence of aging on lv hemodynamics and remodeling late after myocardial infarction (mi) in fischer 344 brown norway rats. in sham rats at 23 mo, lv weight, myocyte cross-sectional area (csa), and myocardial fibrosis were increased, whereas lv dp/d t, lv relaxation, and maximal lv systolic function declined with respect to younger rats (7, 12, and 18 mo of age). isometric myocardial function was evaluated in papillary muscles of 12- and 23-mo-old sham rats. myocardial systolic function was decreased in older rats. to determine how aging affects lv function and remodeling after mi, rats were infarcted at 7 and 18 mo of age and were studied 5 mo later. infarct size was similar in each group. right ventricular weight, lv end-diastolic pressure, and volume index were increased, whereas lv dp/d t, peak cardiac index, and peak developed lv pressure declined after mi. however, there were no significant differences between young and older rats in any variable of lv systolic function or remodeling after mi. myocyte csa increased in younger rats after mi but was unchanged in 23-mo-old rats. after mi, myocardial fibrosis was significantly increased from baseline only in younger rats. the negative interaction of aging and mi on myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis was highly significant. the findings indicate that baseline lv and myocardial function decline with age. in the aging rat after mi, despite limited compensatory hypertrophy and more advanced baseline myocardial fibrosis, the long-term functional and structural adaptations to mi are similar to those of the mature adult heart. this study was designed to answer two questions. first, does the left ventricular contractile dysfunction resulting from mitral regurgitation (mr) reflect a primary defect in the cardiac muscle cell? second, what is the basis for any change in cellular contractile function that might be observed? left ventricular volume overload was produced in 10 dogs by catheter transection of mitral chordae tendineae. three months later in these and in seven control dogs, left ventricular contractile function was characterized by the end-ejection stress-volume relation (eesvr). investigators who were blinded to these results then characterized the contractile performance of cardiac muscle cells, or cardiocytes, from these same left ventricles in terms of the viscosity (graded external load)-velocity relation. finally, the tissue and cellular components of these same left ventricles were analyzed morphometrically. both the left ventricles from the mr group and their constituent cardiocytes showed marked contractile abnormalities. by matching ventricles with cells from the same mr dogs, ventricular eesvr was correlated with cardiocyte peak sarcomere shortening velocity (ssv). the correlation coefficient between eesvr and ssv was 0.63, but between a size-independent measure of active ventricular stiffness and ssv, it was 0.88. no change in left ventricular interstitial volume fraction was found in mr dogs, but both ventricular and cellular contractile dysfunction strongly correlated with a decreased volume fraction of cardiocyte myofibrils. last, in an attempt to relate the degree of contractile dysfunction to the hypertrophic response, left ventricular mass in the mr dogs was correlated with both cellular and ventricular contractile indexes; no significant correlation was found. three conclusions are warranted by these studies. first, chronic left ventricular volume overload from mitral regurgitation leads to contractile defects at both the ventricular and cellular levels, the extent of which correlates well in individual animals. second, no quantitative interstitial change resulted from mr. taken together, these two findings strongly suggest that the contractile defect is intrinsic to the cardiocyte. third, while the contractile abnormality in mr remains undefined, the most basic defects appear to be a combination of myofibrillar loss with the failure of compensatory hypertrophy to occur in response to progressive decrements in cellular and ventricular function.
previously we described a video signal analysis (vsa) method for measuring backscatter and attenuation from b-mode image data. vsa computes depth-dependent ratios of the mean echo intensity from a sample to the mean echo intensity from a reference phantom imaged using identical scanner settings. the slope of a line-fit of this ratio (expressed in db) versus depth is related to the attenuation of the sample. this paper investigates conditions for which the echo intensity ratio versus depth is independent of transducer pulsing characteristics and instrument settings, and depends only on the properties of the sample and the reference. a theoretical model is described for the echo signal power versus depth from a uniform medium containing scatterers. the model incorporates bandwidth, frequency and media attenuation. results show that the sample-to-reference echo intensity ratio versus depth is a curve, the departure of which from a straight line is a function of the relative attenuation of the two media, the imaging system bandwidth and the initial frequency. the model also leads to a depth-dependent "effective frequency" determination in the vsa method. model predictions are verified using rf signals computed by an acoustic pulse-echo simulation program. a comparison is made between pulse echo response profiles obtained in water and profiles obtained in a tissue‐mimicking (tm) material for clinical ultrasound transducers. the tm material is assumed to provide a more accurate indication of actual beam profiles in soft tissue because of the presence of frequency‐dependent attenuation in the material. pulse echo response profiles measured in the tm medium demonstrate a reduction in the focal distance and degraded resolution distal to the focal distance, in comparison to profiles obtained in water.
this paper presents the visual attention engine (vae), which is a digital cellular neural network (cnn) that executes the va algorithm to speed up object-recognition. the proposed time-multiplexed processing element (tmpe) cnn topology achieves high performance and small area by integrating 4800 (8060) cells and 120 pes. pipelined operation of the pes and single-cycle global shift capability of the cells result in a high pe utilization ratio of 93%. the cells are implemented by 6t static random access memory-based register files and dynamic shift registers to enable a small area of 4.5 . the bus connections between pes and cells are optimized to minimize power consumption. the vae is integrated within an object-recognition system-on-chip (soc) fabricated in the 0.13- complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process. it achieves 24 gops peak performance and 22 gops sustained performance at 200 mhz enabling one cnn iteration on an 8060 pixel image to be completed in just 4.3 . with va enabled using the vae, the workload of the object-recognition soc is significantly reduced, resulting in 83% higher frame rate while consuming 45% less energy per frame without degradation of recognition accuracy. a 100gops vision processor lsi (imapcar) for in-vehicle image recognition which consumes less than 2 watts of power has been developed. 128 of 4-way vliw with mac (multiply add accumulation) processor elements (pe) to which data are assigned efficiently by dma companion scaling capability, has achieved high performance in low cost. compared with a previous design, performance for major vision tasks has been improved by a factor of 2.5 while 50% of power is reduced.
microglial cells respond to the herpes simplex virus (hsv)-1 by producing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. after this inflammatory burst, these cells undergo apoptotic cell death. we have recently demonstrated that both virus-induced immune mediator production and apoptosis were induced through toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) signaling. based upon these findings, we hypothesized that the inhibition of tlr2 signaling may serve as a means to alleviate excessive neuroinflammation. in the present study, we cloned four vaccinia virus (vv) proteins, which have been reported to disrupt either tlr signaling or nf-κb activation, and overexpressed them in hek293t cells stably expressing murine tlr2 and in primary murine microglia. using an nf-κb-driven luciferase reporter gene assay, we show that upon stimulation with hsv and listeria monocytogenes, all four vaccinia proteins inhibited tlr2 signaling with different levels of inhibition in the tlr2-expressing cell line and primary microglia. we found similar results when microglial cells were stimulated with the tlr4 ligand lps and the tlr9 ligand cpg odn. taken together, these data provide evidence that these vv proteins can function as inhibitors of tlr signaling in primary microglial cells. recent studies indicate that tlrs are critical in generating innate immune responses during infection with hsv-1. in this study, we investigated the role of tlr2 signaling in regulating the production of neuroimmune mediators by examining cytokine and chemokine expression using primary microglial cells obtained from tlr2−/− as well as wild-type mice. data presented here demonstrate that tlr2 signaling is required for the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines: tnf-α, il-1β, il-6, il-12, ccl7, ccl8, ccl9, cxcl1, cxcl2, cxcl4, and cxcl5. cxcl9 and cxcl10 were also induced by hsv, but their production was not dependent upon tlr2 signaling. because tlr2−/− mice display significantly reduced mortality and diminished neuroinflammation in response to brain infection with hsv, the tlr2-dependent cytokines identified here might function as key players influencing viral neuropathogenesis.
spike threshold filters incoming inputs and thus gates activity flow through neuronal networks. threshold is variable, and in many types of neurons there is a relationship between the threshold voltage and the rate of rise of the membrane potential (dvm/dt) leading to the spike. in primary sensory cortex this relationship enhances the sensitivity of neurons to a particular stimulus feature. while na+ channel inactivation may contribute to this relationship, recent evidence indicates that k+ currents located in the spike initiation zone are crucial. here we used a simple hodgkin-huxley biophysical model to systematically investigate the role of k+ and na+ current parameters (activation voltages and kinetics) in regulating spike threshold as a function of dvm/dt. threshold was determined empirically and not estimated from the shape of the vm prior to a spike. this allowed us to investigate intrinsic currents and values of gating variables at the precise voltage threshold. we found that na+ inactivation is sufficient to produce the relationship provided it occurs at hyperpolarized voltages combined with slow kinetics. alternatively, hyperpolarization of the k+ current activation voltage, even in the absence of na+ inactivation, is also sufficient to produce the relationship. this hyperpolarized shift of k+ activation allows an outward current prior to spike initiation to antagonize the na+ inward current such that it becomes self-sustaining at a more depolarized voltage. our simulations demonstrate parameter constraints on na+ inactivation and the biophysical mechanism by which an outward current regulates spike threshold as a function of dvm/dt. the exact site of initiation and shape of action potentials vary among different neuronal types. the reason for this variability is largely unknown, but the subunit composition, density and distribution of voltage-gated sodium (nav) and potassium (kv) channels within the axon initial segment (ais) are likely to play a key role. here, we asked how heterogeneous are the density and distribution of nav and kv channels within the aiss of a variety of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. most of the studied cell types expressed a high density of nav1.6, kv1.1, and kv1.2 subunits in their ais, but the nav1.1 subunit could only be detected in gabaergic interneurons. a proximo-distal gradient in the density of these subunits was observed within the ais of certain nerve cells but not in others. for example, a gradual increase of the nav1.6 subunit was observed in cortical layer 2/3 and hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cell (pc) aiss, whereas its density was rather uniform in layer 5 pc aiss. the nav1.1 subunit was distributed evenly along the ais of short-axon cells of the main olfactory bulb but was restricted to the proximal part of the ais in cortical and cerebellar interneurons. our results reveal a cell type-dependent expression of sodium and potassium channel subunits with varying densities along the proximo-distal axis of the aiss. this precise arrangement is likely to contribute to the diversity of firing properties observed among central neurons.
backgroundthe purpose of this study was to unveil whether azole antifungals used in agriculture, similar to the clinical azoles used in humans, can evoke resistance among relevant human pathogens like aspergillus fumigatus, an ubiquitous agent in nature. additionally, cross-resistance with clinical azoles was investigated. antifungal susceptibility testing of environmental and clinical isolates of a. fumigatus was performed according to the clsi m38-a2 protocol. in vitro induction assays were conducted involving daily incubation of susceptible a. fumigatus isolates, at 35°c and 180 rpm, in fresh gyep broth medium supplemented with prochloraz (pcz), a potent agricultural antifungal, for a period of 30 days. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of pcz and clinical azoles were monitored every ten days. in order to assess the stability of the developed mic, the strains were afterwards sub-cultured for an additional 30 days in the absence of antifungal. along the in vitro induction process, microscopic and macroscopic cultural observations were registered.resultsmic of pcz increased 256 times after the initial exposure; cross-resistance to all tested clinical azoles was observed. the new mic value of agricultural and of clinical azoles maintained stable in the absence of the selective pcz pressure. pcz exposure was also associated to morphological colony changes: macroscopically the colonies became mostly white, losing the typical pigmentation; microscopic examination revealed the absence of conidiation.conclusionspcz exposure induced aspergillus fumigatus morphological changes and an evident increase of mic value to pcz as well as the development of cross-resistance with posaconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole. aspergillus fumigatus, a ubiquitously distributed opportunistic pathogen, is the global leading cause of aspergillosis and causes one of the highest numbers of deaths among patients with fungal infections [1]. invasive aspergillosis is the most severe manifestation with an overall annual incidence up to 10% in immunosuppressed patients, whereas chronic pulmonary aspergillosis affects about 3 million, primarily immunocompetent, individuals each year [2]. three triazole antifungals, namely itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole, are recommended first-line drugs in the treatment and prophylaxis of aspergillosis [3]. however, azole resistance in a. fumigatus isolates is increasingly reported with variable prevalence in europe, the united states, south america, china, japan, iran, and india [4]–[9]. for example, about 10% of strains of a. fumigatus from the netherlands are itraconazole resistant, and in the united kingdom, the frequency increased from 0%–5% during 2002–2004 to 17%–20% in 2007–2009 [10]–[13]. in the artemis global surveillance program involving 62 medical centers, 5.8% of a. fumigatus strains showed elevated mics to one or more triazoles [5]. similarly, the prospective scare (surveillance collaboration on aspergillus resistance in europe) study involving 22 medical centers in 19 countries identified an overall prevalence of 3.4% azole resistance. azole-resistant a. fumigatus (araf) ranged from 0% to 26% among the 22 centres and was detected in 11 (57.9%) of the 19 participating european countries [4 and p.e. verweij, personal communication]. interestingly, almost half (48.9%) of the araf isolates from the scare network in european countries were resistant to multiple azoles and harbored the tr34/l98h mutation in the cyp51a gene [4 and p.e. verweij, personal communication]. indeed, multi-azole resistance in a. fumigatus due to the tr34/l98h mutations has become an emerging problem in both europe and asia and has been associated with high rates of treatment failures [12]–[14].    azole antifungal drugs inhibit the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, specifically the cytochrome p450 sterol 14-α-demethylase encoded by the cyp51a gene, which leads to depletion of ergosterol and accumulation of toxic sterols. the majority of araf isolates contain alterations in the target enzyme and the mutated target showed reduced or no binding to the drugs [15]. while most mutations in araf isolates were single nucleotide substitutions in the target gene (cyp51a), mutations at other genes such as the cdr1b have also been reported. for example, in the united kingdom the frequency of araf isolates without cyp51a mutations has been reported to be more than 50% [16].
pulmonary surfactant phospholipids have been shown previously to regulate inflammatory functions of human monocytes. this study was undertaken to delineate the mechanisms by which pulmonary surfactant modulates the respiratory burst in a human monocytic cell line, monomac-6 (mm6). preincubation of mm6 cells with the surfactant preparations survanta, curosurf, or exosurf neonatal inhibited the oxidative response to either lipopolysaccharide (lps) and zymosan or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma) by up to 50% (p < 0.01). preincubation of mm6 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes with dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (dppc), the major phospholipid component of surfactant, inhibited the oxidative response to zymosan. dppc did not directly affect the activity of the nadph oxidase in a mm6 reconstituted cell system, suggesting that dppc does not affect the assembly of the individual components of this enzyme into a functional unit. the effects of dppc were evaluated on both lps/zymosan and pma activation of protein kinase c (pkc), a ubiquitous intracellular kinase, in mm6 cells. we found that dppc significantly inhibited the activity of pkc in stimulated cells by 70% (p < 0.01). western blotting experiments demonstrated that dppc was able to attenuate the activation of the pkcdelta isoform but not pkcalpha. these results suggest that dppc, the major component of pulmonary surfactant, plays a role in modulating leukocyte inflammatory responses in the lung via downregulation of pkc, a mechanism that may involve the pkcdelta isoform. thrombolysis is widely used to intervene in acute ischemic stroke, but reestablishment of circulation may paradoxically initiate a reperfusion injury. here we describe studies with mice lacking protein kinase cdelta (pkcdelta) showing that absence of this enzyme markedly reduces reperfusion injury following transient ischemia. this was associated with reduced infiltration of peripheral blood neutrophils into infarcted tissue and with impaired neutrophil adhesion, migration, respiratory burst, and degranulation in vitro. total body irradiation followed by transplantation with bone marrow from pkcdelta-null mice donors reduced infarct size and improved neurological outcome in wt mice, whereas marrow transplantation from wt donors increased infarction and worsened neurological scores in pkcdelta-null mice. these results indicate an important role for neutrophil pkcdelta in reperfusion injury and strongly suggest that pkcdelta inhibitors could prove useful in the treatment of stroke.
the best predictor of future misbehavior is a history of aberrant and wayward conduct. even so, few theories attempt to account for time-stable maladaptive pathways. to this end, we advance a theory of stability, what we term coherence theory. coherence theory conceptualizes stability as an emergent property that occurs when antisocial dispositions, social consequences, and misconduct coalesce within an individual. in this sense, misconduct is viewed as only one component of a larger, overarching and multi-faceted emergent construct we label as “concentrated personal disadvantage.” when these three components coalesce within an individual, temporal stability in maladaptive pathways should be expected. using nationally representative, longitudinal data from the national survey of children, we test specific hypotheses derived from our theory. this study makes use of the first and second waves of survey data (n wave 1 = 2,301; n wave 2 = 1,423). the sample overall was 51% male and 52% white. our analyses provide tentative support for the proposed theory. concentrated personal disadvantage was found to emerge when the identified constellation of variables coalesced in individuals, and was found to be relatively stable over a 5 year period for males and females. coherence theory challenges traditional theories on the stability of antisocial pathways, offers specific conditions under which high levels of stability are likely, and explains why disruption off of antisocial pathways is so difficult. this study used data from 6 sites and 3 countries to examine the developmental course of physical aggression in childhood and to analyze its linkage to violent and nonviolent offending outcomes in adolescence. the results indicate that among boys there is continuity in problem behavior from childhood to adolescence and that such continuity is especially acute when early problem behavior takes the form of physical aggression. chronic physical aggression during the elementary school years specifically increases the risk for continued physical violence as well as other nonviolent forms of delinquency during adolescence. however, this conclusion is reserved primarily for boys, because the results indicate no clear linkage between childhood physical aggression and adolescent offending among female samples despite notable similarities across male and female samples in the developmental course of physical aggression in childhood.
arabidopsis harbors four udp-glycosyltransferases that convert hydroxycinnamates (hcas) to 1-o-β-glucose esters, ugt84a1 (encoded by at4g15480), ugt84a2 (at3g21560), ugt84a3 (at4g15490), and ugt84a4 (at4g15500). to elucidate the role of the individual ugt84a enzymes in planta we analyzed gene expression, ugt activities and accumulation of phenylpropanoids in arabidopsis wild type plants, ugt mutants and overexpressing lines. individual ugt84a null alleles did not significantly reduce the gross metabolic flux to the accumulating compounds sinapoylcholine (sinapine) in seeds and sinapoylmalate in leaves. for the ugt84a2 mutant, lc/ms analysis revealed minor qualitative and quantitative changes of several hca choline esters and of disinapoylspermidine in seeds. overexpression of individual ugt84a genes caused increased enzyme activities but failed to produce significant changes in the pattern of accumulating hca esters. for ugt84a3, our data tentatively suggest an impact on cell wall-associated 4-coumarate. exposure of plants to enhanced uv-b radiation induced the ugt84a-encoding genes and led to a transient increase in sinapoylglucose and sinapoylmalate concentrations. the three major flavonoids isolated from arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in the greenhouse were identified by means of spectroscopic analysis (uv, nmr, ms) and chiral capillary zone electrophoresis as the novel kaempferol 3-o-beta-[beta-d-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)d-glucopyranoside]-7-o-alpha-l- rhamnopyranoside (1), kaempferol 3-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside-7-o-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside (2), and kaempferol 3-o-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside-7-o-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside (3). comprehensive nmr studies including selective 1d and gradient-enhanced 2d techniques were applied in order to achieve full signal assignment and definitive proof of linkage for compound 1.
the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-1β (il-1β) can promote physiological cell migration, as well as cancer cell invasion and metastasis. its role in human trophoblast invasion, however, has not been satisfactorily answered since direct, indirect as well as no effects on trophoblast motility have been published. therefore, the role of il-1β has been re-evaluated by exclusively using human primary trophoblast model systems. immunofluorescence of first trimester placentae indicated il-1 receptor 1 (il-1r1) protein expression in first trimester villous cytotrophoblasts (vctb) and extravillous trophoblasts (evt). the latter expressed higher mrna levels of the receptor as shown by comparative gene chip data of vctb and evt. similarly, western blot analyses and immunofluorescence revealed a time- and differentiation-dependent increase of il-1r1 in primary evt seeded on fibronectin. il-1β dose-dependently elevated migration of isolated first trimester evt through fibronectin-coated transwells, which was inhibited in the presence of il-1r antagonist (il-1ra), whereas proliferation of these cells was not affected. similarly, the interleukin did not alter proliferation of vctb and cell column trophoblasts in floating villi of early pregnancy, but promoted migration in villous explant cultures seeded on collagen i. western blot analyses of supernatants of primary evt and first trimester villous explant cultures revealed il-1β induced secretion of urokinase plasminogen activator (upa), plasminogen activator inhibitor (pai)-1 and pai-2, which was diminished upon combined il-1β/il-1ra treatment. in conclusion, these data suggest that il-1β directly promotes trophoblast motility of first trimester evt involving the upa/pai system. interleukin-1 receptor type i, il-1 beta, il-1 receptor antagonist, and human macrophages were immunohistochemically localized in the villous trophoblast, maternal-trophoblast interphase, and maternal decidua during early human implantation. immunostaining for il-1 receptor type i was present in the syncytiotrophoblast and hyperplastic endometrial glands in the maternal decidua. immunoreactive il-1 beta was present in the villous cytotrophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast, intermediate trophoblast, and maternal stromal decidual cells. il-1 receptor antagonist staining was observed in the glandular endometrium of the maternal decidua and in isolated cells located inside the chorionic villi, intervillous space, and maternal decidua. mature human macrophages, as defined by both cd/68+ and ham56+, were present in the chorionic villi, maternal blood of intervillous space, and maternal decidua. co-localization studies demonstrated that macrophages in all of the reported locations also stained for immunoreactive il-1 beta. our results show the shared presence in maternal and embryonic tissues of this receptor-agonist-antagonist system during early human implantation. this finding supports an autocrine/paracrine role for the il-1 system in human implantation.

to understand the roles of phosphoinositides [ptdins] in phagocytosis of parasitic eukaryotes, we examined the interaction of phosphatidylinositol‐3‐phosphate [ptdins(3)p] and putative ptdins‐p‐binding proteins during phagocytosis in the enteric protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica. it was previously shown that phagocytosis in e. histolytica is indispensable for virulence and is inhibited by ptdins 3‐kinase inhibitors. we demonstrated by time‐lapse live imaging that during the initiation of phagocytosis, the ptdins(3)p biomarker gfp–hrs–fyve, was translocated to the phagocytic cup, phagosome, and to tunnel‐like structures connecting the plasma membrane and phagosomes. e. histolytica possesses 12 fyve domain‐containing proteins (ehfp1‐12), 11 of which also contain the rhogef/dh domain. among them ehfp4 was shown to be recruited to the tunnel‐like structures and to the proximal region of the phagosome. we further demonstrated that ehfp4 physically interacted with 4 of 10 predominant rho/rac small gtpases. phosphoinositide binding assay showed that ehfp4 unexpectedly bound to ptdins(4)p via the carboxyl‐terminal domain and that the fyve domain modulates the binding specificity of ehfp4 to ptdins‐p. expression of the fyve domain from ehfp4 inhibited phagocytosis while enhancement was observed when mammalian hrs–fyve domain was expressed. altogether, we demonstrated that ptdins(3)p, ptdins(4)p and ehfp4 coordinately regulate phagocytosis and phagosome maturation in this parasitic eukaryote. endocytosis is an important virulence function for entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amoebic dysentery. although a number of e. histolytica proteins that regulate this process have been identified, less is known about the role of lipids. in other systems, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (pi3p), a product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi 3-kinase), has been shown to be required for endocytosis. fyve-finger domains are protein motifs that bind specifically to pi3p. using a pi3p biosensor consisting of glutathione-s-transferase (gst) fused to two tandem fyve-finger domains, we have localized pi3p to phagosomes but not fluid-phase pinosomes in e. histolytica, suggesting a role for pi3p in phagocytosis. treatment of cells with pi 3-kinase inhibitors impaired gst-2 x fyve-phagosome association supporting the authenticity of the biosensor staining. however, treatment with pi 3-kinase inhibitors did not inhibit e. histolytica-particle interaction, indicating that pi3p is not required for the initial step, but is required for subsequent steps of phagocytosis.
disease predictive systems are intended to be management aids. with a few exceptions, these systems typically do not have direct sustained use by growers. rather, their impact is mostly pedagogic and indirect, improving recommendations from farm advisers and shaping management concepts. the degree to which a system is consulted depends on the amount of perceived new, actionable information that is consistent with the objectives of the user. often this involves avoiding risks associated with costly disease outbreaks. adoption is sensitive to the correspondence between the information a system delivers and the information needed to manage a particular pathosystem at an acceptable financial risk; details of the approach used to predict disease risk are less important. the continuing challenge for researchers is to construct tools relevant to farmers and their advisers that improve upon their current management skill. this goal requires an appreciation of growers' decision calculus in managing disease problems and, more broadly, their overall farm enterprise management. twenty five years after its first enunciation, ipm is recognized as one of the most robust constructs to arise in the agricultural sciences during the second half of the twentieth century. the history of ipm, however, can be traced back to the late 1800s when ecology was identified as the foundation for scientific plant protection. that history, since the advent of modern organosynthetic pesticides, acquired elements of drama, intrigue, jealousy, and controversy that mark the path of many great scientific or technological achievements. evolution of ipm followed multiple paths in several countries and reached beyond the confines of entomological sciences. time and space constraints, however, bias this review toward entomology, among the plant protection sciences, and give it an obvious us slant, despite the global impact of ipm.
many studies have shown that human leukocyte antigen (hla) class i alleles are associated with the development of various cancers. however, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) is still unknown. to investigate whether hla class i allelic polymorphism is related to the development of hepatitis b virus(hbv)-associated hcc, a total of 326 hbv-infected patients (138 individuals with hcc and 188 well-matched controls without hcc) were enrolled in this study. hla-a, -b, and -c were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-sequencing based typing (pcr-sbt) method. we identified hla-b(∗)35:01:01g as a risk factor for hbv-related hcc development independent of our previous findings in hla region (or, 12.04; p, 0.0028; pc, 0.04). hla-a(∗)11:01:01g, b(∗)58:01:01g, c(∗)03:02:01g and some of their extended haplotypes were found as potential susceptible factors for hcc development. hla-b(∗)46:01:01g and some of its extended haplotypes were found as potential protective factors for hcc development. our results support that specific hla class i alleles and haplotypes may affect the risk of hbv-related hcc development. the findings may help to determine better approaches for prevention and treatment of hcc in these patients. the high prevalence of nasopharyngeal cancer (npc) in southern asia and mediterranean northern africa suggests genetic predisposition among other factors. while human leukocyte antigen (hla) haplotypes have been conclusively associated with npc predisposition in asians, northern african maghrebians have been less intensely studied. however, low resolution serological methods identified weak positive associations with hla-b5, b13 and b18 and a negative with hla-b14. using sequence based typing (sbt), we performed a direct comparison of hla class i frequencies in a cohort of 136 tunisian patients with npc matched for gender, age and geographical residence to 148 normal tunisians. the bimodal age distribution of npc in maghrebians was also taken into account. hla frequencies in normal tunisians were also compared with those of northern moroccan berbers (me) to evaluate whether the tunisian population in this study could be considered representative of other maghrebian populations. hla-b14 and -cw08 were negatively associated with npc (odd ratio = 0.09 and 0.18 respectively, fisher p2-value = 0.0001 and = 0.003). moreover, positive associations were observed for hla-b-18, -b51 (split of -b5) and -b57 (p2-value < 0.025 in all) confirming previous findings in maghrebs. the hla-b14/cw*08 haplotype frequency (hf) was 0.007 in npc patients compared to 0.057 in both tunisian (or = 0.12; p2-value = 0.001) and moroccan controls. this study confirms several previous associations noted by serologic typing between hla class i alleles and the prevalence of npc in maghrebians populations. in addition, we identified a putative haplotype rare in tunisian patients with npc that may serve as a genetic marker for further susceptibility studies.
three homologous spectrin domains have remarkably different folding characteristics. we have previously shown that the slow-folding r16 and r17 spectrin domains can be altered to resemble the fast folding r15, in terms of speed of folding (and unfolding), landscape roughness and folding mechanism, simply by substituting five residues in the core. here we show that, by contrast, r15 cannot be engineered to resemble r16 and r17. it is possible to engineer a slow-folding version of r15, but our analysis shows that this protein neither has a rougher energy landscape nor does change its folding mechanism. quite remarkably, r15 appears to be a rare example of a protein with a folding nucleus that does not change in position or in size when its folding nucleus is disrupted. thus, while two members of this protein family are remarkably plastic, the third has apparently a restricted folding landscape. energy landscape theory is a powerful tool for understanding the structure and dynamics of complex molecular systems, in particular biological macromolecules. the primary sequence of a protein defines its free-energy landscape and thus determines the folding pathway and the rate constants of folding and unfolding, as well as the protein’s native structure. theory has shown that roughness in the energy landscape will lead to slower folding, but derivation of detailed experimental descriptions of this landscape is challenging. simple folding models show that folding is significantly influenced by chain entropy; proteins in which the contacts are local fold quickly, owing to the low entropy cost of forming stabilizing, native contacts during folding. for some protein families, stability is also a determinant of folding rate constants. where these simple metrics fail to predict folding behaviour, it is probable that there are features in the energy landscape that are unusual. such general observations cannot explain the folding behaviour of the r15, r16 and r17 domains of α-spectrin. r15 folds ∼3,000 times faster than its homologues, although they have similar structures, stabilities and, as far as can be determined, transition-state stabilities. here we show that landscape roughness (internal friction) is responsible for the slower folding and unfolding of r16 and r17. we use chimaeric domains to demonstrate that this internal friction is a property of the core, and suggest that frustration in the landscape of the slow-folding spectrin domains may be due to misdocking of the long helices during folding. theoretical studies have suggested that rugged landscapes will result in slower folding; here we show experimentally that such a phenomenon directly influences the folding kinetics of a ‘normal’ protein, that is, one with a significant energy barrier that folds on a relatively slow, millisecond–second, timescale.
a number of studies have recommended application of large quantities of manure alone or in combination with inorganic fertilizer in sub-saharan africa (ssa). however, yield responses of cereals such as maize are very modest even at manure application rates exceeding 10 t ha−1 year−1. we conducted a meta-analysis of data from 64 studies across 14 countries in ssa in order to explore variability in nutrient concentrations, stoichiometry and maize yield responses to animal manure. we observed novel instances of stoichiometry and correlations between organic carbon (c), total nitrogen (n), phosphorus (p) and potassium (k) concentrations, and elemental ratios in manure. in 27% of the manure samples the c:n ratio was greater than 25 indicating that n will be potentially unavailable to crops due to net immobilization. in over 94% of the manure samples, the n:p and c:p ratios were <15 and <200 indicating net p mineralization. therefore, decomposition rates and crop responses are likely to be n-limited rather than p-limited in the majority of the manure applied. our analyses also demonstrate that manure application rates and n and p concentrations are less important than c:n and n:p ratios in determining maize yield response to manure. therefore, emphasis in the future should not be on increasing manure application rates but on approaches that ensure favourable c:n and n:p ratios. our findings also suggest the need for feeding animals with high quality diet to get better quality manure, higher crop yields and improve household food security in ssa. the effect of integrated farmyard manure (fym) and inorganic nitrogen (n) and phosphorous (p) fertilizers on growth, yield, and terminal moisture stress tolerance of rain-fed lowland rice was assessed in a field experiment carried out at fogera plains, in north-western ethiopia during the main cropping seasons of 2010 and 2011. treatments were factorial combinations of three rates of fym (0, 7.5, and 15 t ha), three rates of nitrogen (0, 60, 120 kg n ha) and three rates of phosphorus (0, 50, and 100 kg p2o5 ha). the experiment was laid out as a randomized complete block design replicated three times per treatment. data were collected on rice yield and yield components. leaf area index (lai), crop growth rate (cgr), net assimilation rate (nar) and harvest index (hi) were computed. economic analysis was also performed by estimating costs of alternative uses of fym and inorganic fertilizers as well as grain and straw prices. analysis of the results revealed that applying fym at 15 t ha combined with 120 kg n ha and 100 kg p2o5 ha increased grain yield by 123% and 38% compared to the negative (00-0 kg ha fym-n-p2o5) and positive (0-120-100 kg ha fym-n-p2o5) controls, respectively. similarly; lai, cgr, nar, the number of filled spikelets per panicle, n and p uptake,biomass yield, and grain protein content as well as agrophysiological efficiency of n and p were significantly enhanced in response to increasing the rates of fym and inorganic n and p fertilizers. it was observed that 15 t ha fym combined with 120 kg n ha and 100 kg p2o5 ha resulted in the maximum grain yield, grain protein content, and terminal moisture stress escape. though grain yield continued increasing significantly upto the highest combinations, results of the economic analysis showed that the maximum net benefit was obtained in response to the application of 7.5 t ha fym combined with 120 kg n ha and 100 kg p2o5 ha.
backgroundthe occurrence of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (cin) was reported to be a predictor of better survival in several cancers. the objective of our study is to evaluate the relationship between the timing of cin and prognosis.methodsbetween june 2012 and august 2014, 290 patients with confirmed metastatic colon cancer received at least one cycle of mfolfox6 as first-line chemotherapy were eligible for assessment as all patients group. of the 232 received at least six cycles of mfolfox6 and survived 150 days after treatment were considered as landmark group. timing of cin was categorized into absence, early-onset and late-onset cin groups. the end of cycle 3 was the cutoff to differentiate early-onset or late-onset. the correlation between timing of cin with survival was analyzed by kaplan-meier method and cox proportional hazards model.resultsin all patients group, the median survival of patients without neutropenia, early-onset and late-onset neutropenia were 6.7, 20.7 and 12.8 months (p < 0.001). the patients with early-onset and late-onset cin had better prognosis than cin absence by multivariate analysis. findings were much the same for landmark group.conclusionsin conclusion, timing of cin is an independent predictor of prognosis in metastatic colon cancer patients received mfolfox6, whereas an early-onset of cin predicts longer survival. background chemotherapy induced neutropenia has been shown to be associated with improved treatment outcomes in selected solid tumours. we studied the association of chemotherapy induced neutropenia with treatment related outcomes in small cell lung cancer (sclc).   methods this is a retrospective analysis of patients receiving chemotherapy for sclc at the royal marsden hospital, uk over an 8 year period. the chemotherapy included carboplatin auc 5, iv and etoposide 100mg/m(2) iv on day 1 and 100mg/m(2) po, b.i.d. on day 2 and 3 every 21 days. patients were stratified into two groups (a) those experiencing grades 0-2 neutropenia and group (b) those experiencing grades 3-4 neutropenia. the outcomes studied were response rate, time to progression (ttp) and overall survival (os).   results 173 patients were studied. the median age 64 (range 39-83) and m/f ratio was 112:61. the response rates in groups a and b was 90% versus 90%, p=1.0. the median ttp in groups a and b was 30 and 38 weeks, p=0.05. the median os in groups a and b was 47 weeks versus 60 weeks, p=0.008. the differences in ttp and os were not significant in patients with extensive stage disease.   conclusions occurrence of chemotherapy induced grade 3 or 4 neutropenia correlated with os in patients with sclc receiving carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. trials exploring controlled, safe intra-patient dose escalation with the intent of achieving grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in patients with sclc are warranted.
phenol and 4-substituted phenols were polymerized by h2o2 as an oxidant and hemin as a catalyst in organic/buffer mixed solvents. the chemical structures of the polymers were similar to those synthesized by the catalysis with horseradish peroxidase. among the organic solvents used, pyridine gave the highest yield of polymer. also, the manner of addition of h2o2 solution affected the polymer yield. horseradish peroxidase (hrp) is a commercially important enzyme that is available from a number of supply houses in a variety of grades of purity and isoenzymic combinations. the present article describes a comparative study made on nine hrp preparations. six of these samples were predominantly composed of basic hrp, pl 8.5, and three of acidic hrp, pl 3.5. two of the basic preparations were of lower purity than the others. the apparent molar catalytic activity of basic hrp with 0.5 mmabts and 0.2 mm h2o2 was around 950 s−1 (about 770 s−1 for the less pure samples) and with a 5 mm guaiacol and 0.6 mm h2o2 was about 180 s−1 for all the samples. a similar value (approximately 1000 s−1) was observed for acidic hrp but only at higher concentrations of abts (20 mm). with 20 mm guaiacol the molar catalytic activity of the acid isoenzyme was 65 s−1. the apparent km for abts of the acidic isoenzyme was 4 mm whereas for the basic isoenzyme it was 0.1 mm. all the enzymes were inactivated by h2o2 when it was supplied as the only substrate. under these conditions the partition ratio (r = number of catalytic cycles given by the enzyme before its inactivation), apparent dissociation constant (kl), and apparent rate constant of inactivation (kinact) were about twice as large for the acidic samples (1350, 2.6 mm, 9 · 10−3 s−1) as for the basic (650, 1.3 mm, 5 · 10−3 s−1). the apparent catalytic constant (kcat) was 3–4 times larger, and the efficiency of catalysis (kcat/kl) was double for the acidic isoenzyme, but the efficiency of inactivation (kinact/kl) was similar. the data obtained provide useful information for those using hrp isoenzymes for biotechnological applications (e.g., biosensors, bioreactors, or assays). © 1996 john wiley & sons, inc.
abstract drug therapy for osteoporosis is widely accepted. bisphosphonates in particular significantly inhibit bone resorption by suppressing osteoclast activity and increasing bone density [1–3]. alendronate is one of these bisphosphonates; it was approved in the united states in the 1990s and is commonly prescribed worldwide [1, 4, 5]. clinical trials have shown its effectiveness in the treatment of fractures related to postmenopausal osteoporosis [6]. however, some recent reports have described unusual subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fractures following long-term alendronate therapy [4, 7–13]. although no causal relationship between long-term alendronate treatment and these atypical stress fractures has been established, some reports suggest that the severe suppression of bone turnover by alendronate may lead to accumulated microdamage to the bone that subsequently results in complete fracture [4, 12]. reports linking long‐term use of bisphosphonates (bps) with atypical fractures of the femur led the leadership of the american society for bone and mineral research (asbmr) to appoint a task force to address key questions related to this problem. a multidisciplinary expert group reviewed pertinent published reports concerning atypical femur fractures, as well as preclinical studies that could provide insight into their pathogenesis. a case definition was developed so that subsequent studies report on the same condition. the task force defined major and minor features of complete and incomplete atypical femoral fractures and recommends that all major features, including their location in the subtrochanteric region and femoral shaft, transverse or short oblique orientation, minimal or no associated trauma, a medial spike when the fracture is complete, and absence of comminution, be present to designate a femoral fracture as atypical. minor features include their association with cortical thickening, a periosteal reaction of the lateral cortex, prodromal pain, bilaterality, delayed healing, comorbid conditions, and concomitant drug exposures, including bps, other antiresorptive agents, glucocorticoids, and proton pump inhibitors. preclinical data evaluating the effects of bps on collagen cross‐linking and maturation, accumulation of microdamage and advanced glycation end products, mineralization, remodeling, vascularity, and angiogenesis lend biologic plausibility to a potential association with long‐term bp use. based on published and unpublished data and the widespread use of bps, the incidence of atypical femoral fractures associated with bp therapy for osteoporosis appears to be very low, particularly compared with the number of vertebral, hip, and other fractures that are prevented by bps. moreover, a causal association between bps and atypical fractures has not been established. however, recent observations suggest that the risk rises with increasing duration of exposure, and there is concern that lack of awareness and underreporting may mask the true incidence of the problem. given the relative rarity of atypical femoral fractures, the task force recommends that specific diagnostic and procedural codes be created and that an international registry be established to facilitate studies of the clinical and genetic risk factors and optimal surgical and medical management of these fractures. physicians and patients should be made aware of the possibility of atypical femoral fractures and of the potential for bilaterality through a change in labeling of bps. research directions should include development of animal models, increased surveillance, and additional epidemiologic and clinical data to establish the true incidence of and risk factors for this condition and to inform orthopedic and medical management. © 2010 american society for bone and mineral research.
during the formation of dental enamel, maturation-stage ameloblasts express ion-transporting transmembrane proteins. the slc4 family of ion-transporters regulates intra- and extracellular ph in eukaryotic cells by cotransporting hco3− with na+. mutation in slc4a4 (coding for the sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter nbce1) induces developmental defects in human and murine enamel. we have hypothesized that nbce1 in dental epithelium is engaged in neutralizing protons released during crystal formation in the enamel space. we immunolocalized nbce1 protein in wild-type dental epithelium and examined the effect of the nbce1-null mutation on enamel formation in mice. ameloblasts expressed gene transcripts for nbce1 isoforms b/d/c/e. in wild-type mice, weak to moderate immunostaining for nbce1 with antibodies that recognized isoforms a/b/d/e and isoform c was seen in ameloblasts at the secretory stage, with no or low staining in the early maturation stage but moderate to high staining in the late maturation stage. the papillary layer showed the opposite pattern being immunostained prominently at the early maturation stage but with gradually less staining at the mid- and late maturation stages. in nbce1−/− mice, the ameloblasts were disorganized, the enamel being thin and severely hypomineralized. enamel organs of cftr−/− and ae2a,b−/− mice (cftr and ae2 are believed to be ph regulators in ameloblasts) contained higher levels of nbce1 protein than wild-type mice. thus, the expression of nbce1 in ameloblasts and the papillary layer cell depends on the developmental stage and possibly responds to ph changes. mature enamel consists of densely packed and highly organized large hydroxyapatite crystals. the molecular machinery responsible for the formation of fully matured enamel is poorly described but appears to involve oscillative ph changes at the enamel surface. we conducted an immunohistochemical investigation of selected transporters and related proteins in the multilayered rat incisor enamel organ. connexin 43 (cx-43) is found in papillary cells and ameloblasts, whereas na(+)-k(+)-atpase is heavily expressed during maturation in the papillary cell layer only. given the distribution of cx-43 channels and na(+)-k(+)-atpase, we suggest that ameloblasts and the papillary cell layer act as a functional syncytium. during enamel maturation ameloblasts undergo repetitive cycles of modulation between ruffle-ended (ra) and smooth-ended (sa) ameloblast morphologies. carbonic anhydrase ii and vacuolar h(+)-atpase are expressed simultaneously at the beginning of the maturation stage in ra cells. the proton pumps are present in the ruffled border of ra and appear to be internalized during the sa stage. both papillary cells and ameloblasts express plasma membrane acid/base transporters (ae2, nbc, and nhe1). ae2 and nhe1 change position relative to the enamel surface as localization of the tight junctions changes during ameloblast modulation cycles. we suggest that the concerted action of the papillary cell layer and the modulating ameloblasts regulates the enamel microenvironment, resulting in oscillating ph fluctuations. the ph fluctuations at the enamel surface may be required to keep intercrystalline spaces open in the surface layers of the enamel, enabling degraded enamel matrix proteins to be removed while hydroxyapatite crystals grow as a result of influx of calcium and phosphate ions.
one approach to correction of diabetes mellitus 2 type (dm2) and its complications is the use of bromocriptine mesylate (bcm), a selective agonist of the dopamine receptor type 2 (da2r). however, the effectiveness and mechanisms of the action of bcm in the treatment of severe forms of dm2 forms currently not understood. the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of 4-week treatment of male rats with neonatal dm2 model using bcm (300 mg/kg daily) on their metabolic parameters and on the activity of the adenylyl cyclase signaling system (acss) in the hypothalamus. exposure to bcm restored glucose tolerance and glucose utilization by exogenous insulin, normalized lipid metabolism, and lowered triglycerides and atherogenic cholesterol levels, which are elevated in dm2. in the hypothalamus of diabetic rats treated with bcm, the regulation of acss by agonists of melanocortin receptors type 4 (mc4r), da2r, and serotonin 1b-subtype receptors and expression of the mc4r gene encoding mc4r were restored. furthermore, bcm treatment did not influence the insulin levels in the blood and its production by pancreatic β-cells. the data indicate that the use of bcm to correct severe forms of experimental dm2 holds promise and show that the therapeutic potential of this drug is based on its ability to restore signaling systems of the hypothalamus that are sensitive to monoamines and peptides of the melanocortin family, which are responsible for the control of energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity. bromocriptine, a dopamine d2 agonist, inhibits seasonal fattening and improves seasonal insulin resistance in syrian hamsters. alterations in daily rhythms of neuroendocrine activities are involved in the regulation of seasonal metabolic changes. changes in circadian neuroendocrine activities that regulate metabolism are believed to be modulated by central circadian oscillators within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (scn) of seasonal animals. we examined the association of metabolic responses to bromocriptine with its effects on the daily rhythms of metabolic hormones and daily monoamine profiles within the scn, a primary circadian pacemaker known to regulate metabolism, in syrian hamsters. obese glucose-intolerant male syrian hamsters (body weight [bw] 185 ± 10 g) held on 14h daily photoperiods were treated at light onset with bromocriptine (800 μg/animal/day, ip) or vehicle for 2 weeks. animals were then subjected to a glucose tolerance test (gtt) (3 g/kg bw, ip). different subsets of animals (n = 6) from each treatment group were sacrificed at 0h/24h, 5h, 10h, 15h, or 20h after light onset for analyses of scn monoamines, plasma insulin, prolactin, cortisol, thyroxin (t4), triiodothyronine (t3), glucose, and free fatty acids (ffas). compared with control values, bromocriptine treatment significantly reduced weight gain (14.9 vs. −2.9 g, p <. 01) and the areas under the gtt glucose and insulin curves by 29% and 48%, respectively (p <. 05). basal plasma insulin concentration was markedly reduced throughout the day in bromocriptine-treated animals without influencing plasma glucose levels. bromocriptine reduced the daily peak in ffa by 26% during the late light span(p <. 05). bromocriptine significantly shifted the daily plasma cortisol peak from the early dark to the light period of the day, reduced the plasma prolactin (mean 1.8 vs. 39.4 ng/dl) and t4 throughout the day (mean 1.6 vs. 3.8 μg/dl), and selectively reduced t3 during the dark period of the day (p <. 01). concurrently, bromocriptine treatment significantly reduced scn dopamine turnover during the light period and shifted daily peaks of scn serotonin and 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-hiaa) content by 12h from the light to the dark period of the day (p <. 05). this was confirmed by a further in vivo microdialysis study in which bromocriptine increased scn extracellular 5-hiaa of glucose-intolerant hamsters during the dark phase (47% increase, p <. 05) toward levels observed in normal glucose-tolerant hamsters. thus, bromocriptine-induced resetting of daily patterns of scn neurotransmitter metabolism is associated with the effects of bromocriptine on attenuation of the obese insulin-resistant and glucose-intolerant condition. a large body of corroborating evidence suggests that such bromocriptine-induced changes in scn monoamine metabolism may be functional in its effects on metabolism.

(fam. menispermaceae), initiates the autophagy-mediated death of human glioblastoma cells by generating reactive oxygen species and activating the autophagy-lysosome pathway. however, its effects on the migration and invasion of human glioblastoma cells have not yet been elucidated. therefore, human glioblastoma u87 and sf767 cells were treated with sh (0.125 and 0.25 mm) for 24 h, and cell migration and invasion were assessed using scratch wound healing, migration and invasion assays. sh promoted g0/g1 phase arrest, inhibited the migration and invasion of the two cell lines, suppressed the activation of nuclear factor kappa b (nfκb) and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-2/-9, triggered endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress, reversed the exogenous epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) induced by the inflammatory microenvironment and the endogenous emt. additionally, nfκb p65 overexpression blocked the sh-mediated inhibitory effects on mmp-2/-9 expression and cell invasion. sh-induced autophagy was reduced in ccaat/enhancer binding protein (c/ebp) homologous protein (chop) or autophagy-related 5 (atg5)-silenced human glioblastoma cells and cells treated with 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-pba) or 3-methyladenine (3-ma), as shown by the decreased levels of the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3b (lc3b)-ii and autophagic vacuoles (avs) stained with monodansylcadaverine (mdc), respectively. moreover, knockdown of chop or atg5 and treatment with 4-pba or 3-ma abolished the sh-mediated inhibition of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, snail and slug) expression and cell invasion, respectively. importantly, sh also regulated the above related pathways in nude mice. based on these findings, sh inhibited cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest, and attenuated the metastasis of u87 and sf767 cells by suppressing mmp-2/-9 expression and reversing the endogenous and exogenous emt in vitro and/or in vivo. thus, sh might be a new potential anti-metastasis agent for the treatment of human glioblastoma. processing bodies (p-bodies) are ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in post-transcriptional mrna metabolism that accumulate in cells exposed to various stress stimuli. the treatment of mammary epithelial cells with transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-β), triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt), and induces the formation of p-bodies. ectopic expression of the transcription factor twist, which stimulates emt downstream of the tgf-β receptor, also promotes p-body formation. removal of tgf-β from treated cells results in the clearance of p-bodies by a process that is blocked by inhibitors of autophagy. activators of autophagy enhance p-body clearance and block emt. blockage of p-body formation by disruption of the gene for ddx6, a protein essential for p-body assembly, blocks emt and prevents tumor cell metastasis in vivo. these studies suggest critical roles for p-body formation and autophagy in transitions of cancer cells between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes and help explain how autophagy functions to promote or suppress tumor cell growth during different stages of tumorigenesis.
we have compared the ability of a number of μ-opioid receptor (mopr) ligands to activate g proteins with their abilities to induce mopr phosphorylation, to promote association of arrestin-3 and to cause mopr internalization. for a model of g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) activation where all agonists stabilize a single active conformation of the receptor, a close correlation between signaling outputs might be expected. our results show that overall there is a very good correlation between efficacy for g protein activation and arrestin-3 recruitment, whereas a few agonists, in particular endomorphins 1 and 2, display apparent bias toward arrestin recruitment. the agonist-induced phosphorylation of mopr at ser375, considered a key step in mopr regulation, and agonist-induced internalization of mopr were each found to correlate well with arrestin-3 recruitment. these data indicate that for the majority of mopr agonists the ability to induce receptor phosphorylation, arrestin-3 recruitment, and internalization can be predicted from their ability as agonists to activate g proteins. for the prototypic mopr agonist morphine, its relatively weak ability to induce mopr internalization can be explained by its low agonist efficacy. we investigated the ability of the activated μ‐opioid receptor (mor) to differentiate between myristoylated gαi1 and gαoa type g proteins, and the maximal activity of a range of synthetic and endogenous agonists to activate each g protein. membranes from hek293 cells stably expressing transfected mor were chaotrope extracted to denature endogenous g‐proteins and reconstituted with specific purified g‐proteins. the g subunits were generated in bacteria and were demonstrated to be recognised equivalently to bovine brain purified g protein by cb1 cannabinoid receptors. the ability of agonists to catalyse the mor‐dependent gdp/[35s]gtps exchange was then compared for gαi1 and gαoa. activation of mor by damgo produced a high‐affinity saturable interaction for gαoa (km=20±1 nm) but a low‐affinity interaction with gαi1 (km=116±12 nm). damgo, met‐enkephalin and leucine‐enkephalin displayed maximal g activation among the agonists evaluated. endomorphins 1 and 2, methadone and β‐endorphin activated both g to more than 75% of the maximal response, whereas fentanyl partially activated both g‐proteins. buprenorphine and morphine demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the maximal activities between gαi1 and gαoa. interestingly, damgo, morphine, endomorphins 1 and 2, displayed significant differences in the potencies for the activation of the two g. differences in maximal activity and potency, for gαi1 versus gαoa, are both indicative of agonist selective activation of g‐proteins in response to mor activation. these findings may provide a starting point for the design of drugs that demonstrate greater selectivity between these two g‐proteins and therefore produce a more limited range of effects.
backgrounddual-tracer-guided sentinel lymph node (sln) biopsy may provide a promising diagnostic tool to assess accurately the status of lymph node metastasis in the surgical operation and assure the oncologic safety of the function or stomach preserving surgery. the diagnostic performance of this technology in recent studies varied. thus, we conducted this meta-analysis.methodsthis systematic review and meta-analysis was registered at the prospero. eligible studies were searched in the pubmed, embase, web of knowledge, and cochrane library databases. a random-effect model was used to pool the data. summary receiver operator characteristic curves, analysis for publication bias, meta-regression, and subgroup analysis were also performed.resultsthe pooled sln identification rate and sensitivity were 0.97 and 0.89. 99mtc-human serum albumin with indocyanine green (icg), 99mtc-antimony sulfur colloid with icg, performing sln biopsy ≥15 min after dye injection, an sln ≥5, the basin dissection, laparoscopic surgery, in studies conducted in japan and studies published after 2012, were associated with higher sensitivity. ct1 stage, performing sln biopsy ≥15 min after dye injection, in studies conducted in japan and studies published after 2012, were related with a higher identification rate.conclusionsdual tracer is promising in sln biopsy in gastric cancer, and the clinical application of sln biopsy should be limited to the patients of ct1n0m0 gastric cancer. the combination of 99mtc-human serum albumin and icg as well as the combination of 99mtc-antimony sulfur colloid and icg may be the optimal tracer combination. however, it seems not justified to put this technique into routine clinical application recently. some factors that might enhance diagnostic value are identified. purpose complicated gastric lymphatic drainage potentially undermines the utility of sentinel node (sn) biopsy in patients with gastric cancer. encouraged by several favorable single-institution reports, we conducted a multicenter, single-arm, phase ii study of sn mapping that used a standardized dual tracer endoscopic injection technique.   patients and methods patients with previously untreated ct1 or ct2 gastric adenocarcinomas < 4 cm in gross diameter were eligible for inclusion in this study. sn mapping was performed by using a standardized dual tracer endoscopic injection technique. following biopsy of the identified sns, mandatory comprehensive d2 or modified d2 gastrectomy was performed according to current japanese gastric cancer association guidelines.   results among 433 patients who gave preoperative consent, 397 were deemed eligible on the basis of surgical findings. sn biopsy was performed in all patients, and the sn detection rate was 97.5% (387 of 397). of 57 patients with lymph node metastasis by conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining, 93% (53 of 57) had positive sns, and the accuracy of nodal evaluation for metastasis was 99% (383 of 387). only four false-negative sn biopsies were observed, and pathologic analysis revealed that three of those biopsies were pt2 or tumors > 4 cm. we observed no serious adverse effects related to endoscopic tracer injection or the sn mapping procedure.   conclusion the endoscopic dual tracer method for sn biopsy was confirmed as safe and effective when applied to the superficial, relatively small gastric adenocarcinomas included in this study.
abstract investigation of a modifier locus displaying a darker eye phenotype in white-apricot flies led to the isolation of the gene encoding udp-glucose dehydrogenase (udpgdh). the p-element insertion  l(3)05007 occurs upstream of the transcription start site of the sugarless (sgl) gene and greatly reduces its transcription at various developmental stages. a single abundant sgl transcript shows a ubiquitous distribution and encodes a 53-kda protein which is 64% identical in sequence to bovine udp-glucose dehydrogenase. overexpression of sgl in e. coli resulted in synthesis of a protein with high levels of udpgdh activity. expression of three genes that participate in pigment deposition, white, scarlet and brown, was significantly affected in populations segregating for sgl, suggesting that it is the decrease in udpgdh level that produces the modifying effect observed. in addition, genetic effects on white-apricot were observed in sgl-wingless and sgl-hedgehog double mutants. recent data have indicated an effect of udpgdh on cell surface glycosaminoglycans (gags) which modulate the activity of growth factors, and in particular wingless signaling. our results suggest that the levels of gags are rate limiting for cell-cell signaling pathways which mediate changes in gene expression. in vitro experiments suggest that glycosaminoglycans (gags) and the proteins to which they are attached (proteoglycans) are important for modulating growth factor signaling. however, in vivo evidence to support this view has been lacking, in part because mutations that disrupt the production of gag polymers and the core proteins have not been available. here we describe the identification and characterization of drosophila mutants in the suppenkasper (ska) gene. the ska gene encodes udp-glucose dehydrogenase which produces glucuronic acid, an essential component for the synthesis of heparan and chondroitin sulfate. ska mutants fail to put heparan side chains on proteoglycans such as syndecan. surprisingly, mutant embryos produced by germ-line clones of this general metabolic gene exhibit embryonic cuticle phenotypes strikingly similar to those that result from loss-of-function mutations in genes of the wingless (wg) signaling pathway. zygotic loss of ska leads to reduced growth of imaginal discs and pattern defects similar to wg mutants. in addition, genetic interactions of ska with wg and dishevelled mutants are observed. these data demonstrate the importance of proteoglycans and gags in wg signaling in vivo and suggest that wnt-like growth factors may be particularly sensitive to perturbations of gag biosynthesis.
laccases (lcs) are multicopper oxidases that find application as versatile biocatalysts for the green bioremediation of environmental pollutants and xenobiotics. in this study we elucidate the degrading activity of lac2 pure enzyme form pleurotus pulmonarius towards aflatoxin b1 (afb1) and m1 (afm1). lc enzyme was purified using three chromatographic steps and identified as lac2 through zymogram and lc-ms/ms. the degradation assays were performed in vitro at 25 °c for 72 h in buffer solution. afb1 degradation by lac2 direct oxidation was 23%. toxin degradation was also investigated in the presence of three redox mediators, (2,2′-azino-bis-[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]) (abts) and two naturally-occurring phenols, acetosyringone (as) and syringaldehyde (sa). the direct effect of the enzyme and the mediated action of lac2 with redox mediators univocally proved the correlation between lac2 activity and aflatoxins degradation. the degradation of afb1 was enhanced by the addition of all mediators at 10 mm, with as being the most effective (90% of degradation). afm1 was completely degraded by lac2 with all mediators at 10 mm. the novelty of this study relies on the identification of a pure enzyme as capable of degrading afb1 and, for the first time, afm1, and on the evidence that the mechanism of an effective degradation occurs via the mediation of natural phenolic compounds. these results opened new perspective for lac2 application in the food and feed supply chains as a biotransforming agent of afb1 and afm1. aflatoxins are cancerogenic compounds produced predominantly by certain strains of the aspergillus genus. the ideal solution for minimization of health risk that aflatoxins pose is the prevention of foods and feeds contamination. unfortunately, these contaminants can never be completely removed, and on that account, many studies have been carried out to explore an effective process of their detoxification to a threshold level. biological decontamination seems to be attractive because it works under mild, environmentally friendly conditions. this review is focused on the biological detoxification of aflatoxins, especially aflatoxin b1, by microorganisms. there are briefly mentioned aflatoxin metabolic pathways in the human and animal body. microorganisms such as soil or water bacteria, fungi, and protozoa and specific enzymes isolated from microbial systems can degrade aflatoxin group members with varied efficiency to less- or nontoxic products. some aflatoxin-producing fungi from aspergillus species have the capability to degrade their own synthesized mycotoxins. yeasts and lactic acid bacteria work as biological adsorbents that prevent aflatoxin’s transfer to the intestinal tract of humans and animals. aflatoxin b1 absorbed into the organism could be metabolized by significantly different pathways. they lead to the production of the relatively nontoxic compounds, on the one hand, or to highly toxic active forms on the other hand.
alcoholic fermentation by an oenological strain of torulaspora delbrueckii in association with an oenological strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied in mixed and sequential cultures. experiments were performed in a synthetic grape must medium in a membrane bioreactor, a special tool designed to study indirect interactions between microorganisms. results showed that the s. cerevisiae strain had a negative impact on the t. delbrueckii strain, leading to a viability decrease as soon as s. cerevisiae was inoculated. even for high inoculation of t. delbrueckii (more than 20× s. cerevisiae) in mixed cultures, t. delbrueckii growth was inhibited. substrate competition and cell-to-cell contact mechanism could be eliminated as explanations of the observed interaction, which was probably an inhibition by a metabolite produced by s. cerevisiae. s. cerevisiae should be inoculated 48 h after t. delbrueckii in order to ensure the growth of t. delbrueckii and consequently a decrease of volatile acidity and a higher isoamyl acetate production. in this case, in a medium with a high concentration of assimilable nitrogen (324 mg l−1), s. cerevisiae growth was not affected by t. delbrueckii. but in a sequential fermentation in a medium containing 176 mg l−1 initial assimilable nitrogen, s. cerevisiae was not able to develop because of nitrogen exhaustion by t. delbrueckii growth during the first 48 h, leading to sluggish fermentation. hanseniaspora guilliermondii and hanseniaspora uvarum were tested in grape must fermentations as pure and mixed starter cultures with saccharomyces cerevisiae. in pure cultures, the specific growth rates found were 0.29 h(-1) for h. uvarum, 0.23 h(-1) for h. guilliermondii and 0.18 h(-1) for s. cerevisiae. no significant differences were observed between these values and those obtained in mixed cultures. results presented in this work show that growth of apiculate yeasts during the first days of fermentation enhances the production of desirable compounds, such as esters, and may not have a negative influence on the production of higher alcohols and undesirable heavy sulphur compounds. growth of apiculate yeasts reduced the total content of higher alcohols in wines, when compared to those produced by a pure culture of s. cerevisiae. furthermore, the highest levels of 2-phenylethyl acetate were obtained when h. guilliermondii was inoculated in grape musts, whereas h. uvarum increased the isoamyl acetate content of wines. apiculate yeasts produced high amounts of ethyl acetate; however, the level of this compound decreased in mixed cultures of apiculate yeasts and s. cerevisiae. when s. cerevisiae was used as a starter culture, wines showed higher concentrations of glycerol, 2-phenylethanol and ethyl hexanoate. in mixed cultures of apiculate yeasts and s. cerevisiae, wines presented amounts of methionol, acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester, 4-(methylthio)-1-butanol, 2-mercaptoethanol and cis-2-methyltetrahydro-thiophen-3-ol similar to those produced by a pure culture of s. cerevisiae. an increase in the amounts of 3-(ethylthio)-1-propanol, trans-2-methyltetrahydro-thiophen-3-ol and 3-mercapto-1-propanol was obtained in wines produced from mixed cultures with h. guilliermondii.
enteric fever, caused by salmonella enterica, remains an unresolved public health problem in india and antimicrobial therapy is the main mode of treatment. the objective of this study was to characterize the salmonella enterica isolates from kolkata with respect to their antimicrobial resistance (amr), virulence profiles and molecular subtypes. salmonella enterica blood isolates were collected from clinically suspected enteric fever patients attending various hospitals in kolkata, india from january 2009 to june 2013 and were tested for amr profiles by standard protocols; for resistance gene transfer by conjugation; for resistance and virulence genes profiles by pcr; and for molecular subtypes by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). a total of 77 salmonella enterica serovar typhi (s. typhi) and 25 salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi a (s. paratyphi a) from kolkata were included in this study. although multidrug resistance (resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole) was decreasing in s. typhi (18.2%) and absent in s. paratyphi a, increased resistance to fluoroquinolone, the current drug of choice, caused growing concern for typhoid treatment. a single, non-conjugative non-inchi1 plasmid of 180 kb was found in 71.4% multidrug resistant (mdr) s. typhi; the remaining 28.6% isolates were without plasmid. various amr markers (bla tem-1, cata, sul1, sul2, dfra15, stra-strb) and class 1 integron with dfra7 gene were detected in mdr s. typhi by pcr and sequencing. most of the study isolates were likely to be virulent due to the presence of virulence markers. major diversity was not noticed among s. typhi and s. paratyphi a from kolkata by pfge. the observed association between amr profiles and s. typhi pulsotypes might be useful in controlling the spread of the organism by appropriate intervention. the study reiterated the importance of continuous monitoring of amr and molecular subtypes of salmonella isolates from endemic regions for better understanding of the disease epidemiology. abstract the prevalence of salmonella enterica serotype paratyphi a infection is increasing, and multidrug resistance is a well-recognized problem. resistance to fluoroquinolones is common and leads to more frequent use of newer agents like azithromycin. we report the first case of azithromycin resistance and treatment failure in a patient with s. paratyphi a infection.
matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) remodel tumor microenvironment and promote cancer metastasis. among the mmp family proteases, the proteolytic activity of the pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic membrane-type 1 (mt1)-mmp constitutes a promising and targetable biomarker of aggressive cancer tumors. in this study, we systematically developed and characterized several highly sensitive and specific biosensors based on fluorescence resonant energy transfer (fret), for visualizing mt1-mmp activity in live cells. the sensitivity of the ahlr-mt1-mmp biosensor was the highest and five times that of a reported version. hence, the ahlr biosensor was employed to quantitatively profile the mt1-mmp activity in multiple breast cancer cell lines, and to visualize the spatiotemporal mt1-mmp activity simultaneously with the underlying collagen matrix at the single cell level. we detected a significantly higher level of mt1-mmp activity in invasive cancer cells than those in benign or non-invasive cells. our results further show that the high mt1-mmp activity was stimulated by the adhesion of invasive cancer cells onto the extracellular matrix, which is precisely correlated with the cell’s ability to degrade the collagen matrix. thus, we systematically optimized a fret-based biosensor, which provides a powerful tool to detect the pro-invasive mt1-mmp activity at single cell levels. this readout can be applied to profile the invasiveness of single cells from clinical samples, and to serve as an indicator for screening anti-cancer inhibitors. matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), a family of zinc-binding endopeptidases, play important roles in cancer proliferation and dissemination, and may be further associated with other diseases. in particular, membrane-type mmps (mt-mmps) are crucial for cancer cell invasion. in this report, we summarize the current views on the role of mt-mmps in cancer dissemination. the regulated and restricted degradation of the extracellular matrix (ecm) surrounding the tumor surface is a trigger event for cell protrusion and invasion. this is thought to be primarily organized by mt-mmps, since a shift in balance between cell adhesion molecules, ecm and proteolysis at the focal cell surface may result in conditions especially suitable for cancer cells to progress and invade the ecm. to resolve the physiological mechanisms of cancer invasion and migration, molecular milieu surrounding the mt-mmps expressed on tumor cell surfaces should be further examined for each cell type, which may consequently provide a novel clinical tool to regulate cancer behavior.
the knat2 (for knotted-like from arabidopsis thaliana 2) homeobox gene is expressed in the vegetative apical meristem. it is also active during flower development, suggesting a function in the structuring of flowers. to investigate its role, we used a dexamethasone (dex)-inducible system to generate transgenic plants that overexpressed a fusion of knat2 with the hormone binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor. dex-induced plants were similar to plants overexpressing the closely related knat1 gene, indicating overlapping functions, although we observed differences as well. in particular, knat2-gr activation induced ectopic carpel features. first, knat2 induced the homeotic conversion of nucellus into carpel-like structures. second, knat2 induced stigmatic papillae on rosette leaves in the ap2-5 background. third, ectopic expression of the carpel identity gene agamous (ag) was observed in carpels and ovules. interestingly, the homeotic conversion was not dependent on ag activity, because it was maintained in the ag-1 ap2-5 double mutant. therefore, our data indicate that knat2 also must activate other carpel regulators. together, these results suggest that knat2 plays a role in carpel development. the first step in flower development is the generation of a floral meristem by the inflorescence meristem. we have analyzed how this process is affected by mutant alleles of the arabidopsis gene leafy. we show that leafy interacts with another floral control gene, apetala1, to promote the transition from inflorescence to floral meristem. we have cloned the leafy gene, and, consistent with the mutant phenotype, we find that leafy rna is expressed strongly in young flower primordia. leafy expression procedes expression of the homeotic genes agamous and apetala3, which specify organ identify within the flower. furthermore, we demonstrate that leafy is the arabidopsis homolog of the floricaula gene, which controls floral meristem identity in the distantly related species antirrhinum majus.
disruption of telomere maintenance pathways leads to accelerated entry into cellular senescence, a stable proliferative arrest that promotes aging‐associated disorders in some mammals. the budding yeast cst complex, comprising cdc13, stn1, and ctc1, is critical for telomere replication, length regulation, and end protection. although mammalian homologues of cst have been identified recently, their role and function for telomere maintenance in normal somatic human cells are still incompletely understood. here, we characterize the function of human stn1 in cultured human fibroblasts and demonstrate its critical role in telomere replication, length regulation, and function. in the absence of high telomerase activity, shrna‐mediated knockdown of hstn1 resulted in aberrant and fragile telomeric structures, stochastic telomere attrition, increased telomere erosion rates, telomere dysfunction, and consequently accelerated entry into cellular senescence. oxidative stress augmented the defects caused by stn1 knockdown leading to almost immediate cessation of cell proliferation. in contrast, overexpression of htert suppressed some of the defects caused by hstn1 knockdown suggesting that telomerase can partially compensate for hstn1 loss. our findings reveal a critical role for human stn1 in telomere length maintenance and function, supporting the model that efficient replication of telomeric repeats is critical for long‐term viability of normal somatic mammalian cells. the proper maintenance of telomeres is essential for genome stability. mammalian telomere maintenance is governed by a number of telomere binding proteins, including the newly identified ctc1–stn1–ten1 (cst) complex. however, the in vivo functions of mammalian cst remain unclear. to address this question, we conditionally deleted ctc1 from mice. we report here that ctc1 null mice experience rapid onset of global cellular proliferative defects and die prematurely from complete bone marrow failure due to the activation of an atr‐dependent g2/m checkpoint. acute deletion of ctc1 does not result in telomere deprotection, suggesting that mammalian cst is not involved in capping telomeres. rather, ctc1 facilitates telomere replication by promoting efficient restart of stalled replication forks. ctc1 deletion results in increased loss of leading c‐strand telomeres, catastrophic telomere loss and accumulation of excessive ss telomere dna. our data demonstrate an essential role for ctc1 in promoting efficient replication and length maintenance of telomeres.
barrier characteristics of brain endothelial cells forming the blood–brain barrier (bbb) are tightly regulated by cellular and acellular components of the neurovascular unit. during embryogenesis, the accumulation of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan agrin in the basement membranes ensheathing brain vessels correlates with bbb maturation. in contrast, loss of agrin deposition in the vasculature of brain tumors is accompanied by the loss of endothelial junctional proteins. we therefore wondered whether agrin had a direct effect on the barrier characteristics of brain endothelial cells. agrin increased junctional localization of vascular endothelial (ve)-cadherin, β-catenin, and zonula occludens-1 (zo-1) but not of claudin-5 and occludin in the brain endothelioma cell line bend5 without affecting the expression levels of these proteins. this was accompanied by an agrin-induced reduction of the paracellular permeability of bend5 monolayers. in vivo, the lack of agrin also led to reduced junctional localization of ve-cadherin in brain microvascular endothelial cells. taken together, our data support the notion that agrin contributes to barrier characteristics of brain endothelium by stabilizing the adherens junction proteins ve-cadherin and β-catenin and the junctional protein zo-1 to brain endothelial junctions. important insights into the molecular mechanism of t cell extravasation across the blood–brain barrier (bbb) have already been obtained using immortalized mouse brain endothelioma cell lines (bend). however, compared with bend, primary brain endothelial cells have been shown to establish better barrier characteristics, including complex tight junctions and low permeability. in this study, we asked whether bend5 and primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (pmbmecs) were equally suited as in vitro models with which to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of t cell extravasation across the bbb. we found that both in vitro bbb models equally supported both t cell adhesion under static and physiologic flow conditions, and t cell crawling on the endothelial surface against the direction of flow. in contrast, distances of t cell crawling on pmbmecs were strikingly longer than on bend5, whereas diapedesis of t cells across pmbmecs was dramatically reduced compared with bend5. thus, both in vitro bbb models are suited to study t cell adhesion. however, because pmbmecs better reflect endothelial bbb specialization in vivo, we propose that more reliable information about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of t cell diapedesis across the bbb can be attained using pmbmecs.
summary. cerebrolysin (ebewe arzneimittel, austria, europe) is a widely used drug relieving the symptoms of a variety of neurological disorders, particularly of neurodegenerative dementia of the alzheimer's type. it consists of approximately 25% of low molecular weight peptides (<10 k da) and a mixture of approximately 75% free amino acids, this being based on the total nitrogen content.in this study we used a low serum (2% serum supplement) cell stress in-vitro model to assess drug effectiveness on neuronal viability and programmed cell death (pcd). in this in-vitro model the type of cell death was previously shown to be primarly apoptotic, which was verified by dna-laddering and tunel-staining. for evaluation of neuronal viability a mtt-reduction assay was performed after 4 div and 8 div and the percentage of apoptotic neurons was determined by bis-benzimide staining of nuclear chromatin.to differentiate between possible effects of the free amino acids and the peptide fraction of cerebrolysin an artificial amino acid mixture (aa-mix) was used as a control.cerebrolysin, the aa-mix and 10% foetal calf serum (fcs) caused a similar increase in viability after 4 div, whereas the effects of the growth factors bdnf and fgf-2 were less pronounced. after 8 div cerebrolysin, but not the aa-mix, was able to ameliorate neuronal viability, which could reflect a neuro-protective effect or an increased activity of the mitochondrial dehydrogenase measured in a mtt-reduction assay. the percentage of cells showing apoptotic chromatin changes was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in cultures treated with cerebrolysin, whereas the aa-mix failed to decrease the percentage of cells showing apoptotic chromatin changes. these findings ascertain an anti-apoptotic effect of the peptide fraction of cerebrolysin and reveal a transient viability promoting effect of the amino acid fraction, which is most likely due to improved nutritional supply. glutamate induced neurotoxicity has been proposed to account for the loss of neurons after ischemia as well as in the cause of neurodegenerative diseases. we have studied the effects of exogenous glutamate on survival of neurons from chick embryo telencephalon, precultured with a peptide derivative for 8 days. the peptide derivative cerebrolysin is a drug produced by standardised enzymatic breakdown consisting of 80% peptides and 20% amino acids. toxic effects of acute glutamate exposure were prevented by cerebrolysin in a concentration-dependent manner. 20 and 40 microliters cerebrolysin produce distinct neuroprotective effects. however, 80 microliters cerebrolysin/ml nutrition medium more than doubles neuronal viability compared to untreated control cells. these concentration-dependent effects of cerebrolysin were evident even at the light microscopic level.
the hiv-1 vpu protein enhances the release of viral particles from the cell-surface in a cell-type specific manner. in the absence of vpu, nascent virions remain tethered to the cell-surface in restricted cell-types. recently, the human host factor bst-2/cd317/tetherin was found to be responsible for the inhibition of virus release. it was also reported that hiv-1 vpu can target human bst-2 but is unable to interfere with the function of murine or simian bst-2. we performed a gain-of-function study to determine which of the differences between human and rhesus bst-2 account for the differential sensitivity to vpu. we transferred human bst-2 sequences into rhesus bst-2 and assessed the resulting chimeras for inhibition of hiv-1 virus release and sensitivity to vpu. we found that rhesus bst-2 carrying the transmembrane (tm) domain of human bst-2 is susceptible to hiv-1 vpu. finally, a single-amino-acid change in the rhesus bst-2 tm domain was sufficient to confer vpu sensitivity. backgroundthe human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) vpu protein enhances virus release from infected cells and induces proteasomal degradation of cd4. recent work identified bst-2/cd317 as a host factor that inhibits hiv-1 virus release in a vpu sensitive manner. a current working model proposes that bst-2 inhibits virus release by tethering viral particles to the cell surface thereby triggering their subsequent endocytosis.resultshere we defined structural properties of bst-2 required for inhibition of virus release and for sensitivity to vpu. we found that bst-2 is modified by n-linked glycosylation at two sites in the extracellular domain. however, n-linked glycosylation was not important for inhibition of hiv-1 virus release nor did it affect surface expression or sensitivity to vpu. rodent bst-2 was previously found to form cysteine-linked dimers. analysis of single, double, or triple cysteine mutants revealed that any one of three cysteine residues present in the bst-2 extracellular domain was sufficient for bst-2 dimerization, for inhibition of virus release, and sensitivity to vpu. in contrast, bst-2 lacking all three cysteines in its ectodomain was unable to inhibit release of wild type or vpu-deficient hiv-1 virions. this defect was not caused by a gross defect in bst-2 trafficking as the mutant protein was expressed at the cell surface of transfected 293t cells and was down-modulated by vpu similar to wild type bst-2.conclusionwhile bst-2 glycosylation was functionally irrelevant, formation of cysteine-linked dimers appeared to be important for inhibition of virus release. however lack of dimerization did not prevent surface expression or vpu sensitivity of bst-2, suggesting vpu sensitivity and inhibition of virus release are separable properties of bst-2.
background and purpose:  the excitability of the visual and motor cortical areas is altered in migraineurs. controversial results of previous studies on cortical excitability may depend on the hormonal status of female subjects. the present study aimed to determine whether the different phases of the menstrual cycle influence the phosphene thresholds (pt) and resting motor thresholds (rmt) in migraineurs. objective: to determine whether there are menstrual cycle–related effects on cortical excitability in normal women. background: ovarian steroid hormones affect neurotransmission in the brain. data from animal experiments have shown that progesterone metabolites enhance the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cortex, producing benzodiazepine-like (e.g., diazepam and lorazepam) physiologic and behavioral effects. estradiol has excitatory effects on measures of neuronal excitability, possibly acting through the glutamate system. these effects have been difficult to detect in women using conventional techniques. however, recently, paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) has been used to detect the effects of gabaergic and glutamatergic drugs in humans. we used this method to measure the effects of the menstrual cycle in normal women. methods: we tested 13 healthy women during the follicular (low-progesterone) and luteal (high-progesterone) phases of the menstrual cycle using paired tms. the effect of a subthreshold conditioning pulse on the cortex was tested by measuring the response to a second suprathreshold test pulse and comparing it with the response elicited by the test pulse administered alone. results: conditioning tms produced more inhibition in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase (p = 0.01), of similar magnitude to the reported effect of benzodiazepine drugs. conclusions: this study provides the first direct evidence of changes in the excitability of a cortical network with the menstrual cycle. the results also show a potential confound for studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation in populations that include menstruating women.
high glucose-induced oxidative stress and increased nadph oxidase-2 (nox2) activity may contribute to the progressive decline of the functional β-cell mass in type 2 diabetes. to test that hypothesis, we characterized, in islets from male nox2 knockout (nox2-ko) and wild-type (wt) c57bl/6j mice cultured for up to 3 weeks at 10 or 30 mmol/l glucose (g10 or g30), the in vitro effects of glucose on cytosolic oxidative stress using probes sensing glutathione oxidation (grx1-rogfp2), thiol oxidation (rogfp1) or h2o2 (rogfp2-orp1), on β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling events and on β-cell apoptosis. after 1-2 days of culture in g10, the glucose stimulation of insulin secretion (gsis) was ∼1.7-fold higher in nox2-ko vs. wt islets at 20-30 mmol/l glucose despite similar rises in nad(p)h and intracellular calcium concentration ([ca2+]i) and no differences in cytosolic grx1-rogfp2 oxidation. after long-term culture at g10, rogfp1 and rogfp2-orp1 oxidation and β-cell apoptosis remained low, and the glucose-induced rises in nad(p)h, [ca2+]i and gsis were similarly preserved in both islet types. after prolonged culture at g30, rogfp1 and rogfp2-orp1 oxidation increased in parallel with β-cell apoptosis, the glucose sensitivity of the nadph, [ca2+]i and insulin secretion responses increased, the maximal [ca2+]i response decreased, but maximal gsis was preserved. these responses were almost identical in both islet types. in conclusion, nox2 is a negative regulator of maximal gsis in c57bl/6j mouse islets, but it does not detectably contribute to the in vitro glucotoxic induction of cytosolic oxidative stress and alterations of β-cell survival and function. aim/hypothesis rat pancreatic islet cell apoptosis is minimal after prolonged culture in 10 mmol/l glucose (g10), largely increased in 5 mmol/l glucose (g5) and moderately increased in 30 mmol/l glucose (g30). this glucose-dependent asymmetric v-shaped profile is preceded by parallel changes in the mrna levels of oxidative stress-response genes like metallothionein 1a (mt1a). in this study, we tested the effect of zncl2, a potent inducer of mt1a, on apoptosis, mitochondrial oxidative stress and alterations of glucose-induced insulin secretion (gsis) induced by prolonged exposure to low and high vs. intermediate glucose concentrations. methods male wistar rat islets were cultured in rpmi medium. islet gene mrna levels were measured by rtq-pcr. apoptosis was quantified by measuring islet cytosolic histone-associated dna fragments and the percentage of tunel-positive β-cells. mitochondrial thiol oxidation was measured in rat islet cell clusters expressing “redox sensitive gfp” targeted to the mitochondria (mt-rogfp1). insulin secretion was measured by ria. results as observed for mt1a mrna levels, β-cell apoptosis and loss of gsis, culture in either g5 or g30 vs. g10 significantly increased mt-rogfp1 oxidation. while tpen decreased mt1a/2a mrna induction by g5, addition of 50–100 µm zncl2 to the culture medium strongly increased mt1a/2a mrna and protein levels, reduced early mt-rogfp oxidation and significantly decreased late β-cell apoptosis after prolonged culture in g5 or g30 vs. g10. it did not, however, prevent the loss of gsis under these culture conditions. conclusion zncl2 reduces mitochondrial oxidative stress and improves rat β-cell survival during culture in the presence of low and high vs. intermediate glucose concentrations without improving their acute gsis.
the overall goals in regard to management of diabetes in the elderly are twofold. first, blood glucose control should be kept as near normal as possible (certainly always less than 200 mg/dl) without inordinately increasing risks related to therapy; this will decrease the risk of acute complications and hopefully of long-term ones as well. second, overall functional status should be maintained or improved. although a number of factors peculiar to old age complicate the management of diabetes, with careful planning these goals should be attainable. abstract a 46-yr-old hypertensive man treated for 1 yr with apresoline 200 mg and propranolol 240 mg daily, was admitted in deep coma, severely dehydrated, serum glucose 1130 mg100 ml without ketonemia, normal serum co 2 , blood ph 7.52, serum osmolarity 357 mosm/kg, fever of 105.6°f, and central venous pressure of less than 1 cm. the plasma free fatty acid was 270 μeg/liter, insulin 16 μu/ml and growth hormone 2.5 ng/ml. he responded excellently to 100 units regular insulin and 8 liters of hypotonic infusions. seven months later he had a similar episode despite addition of 1 g tolbutamide daily in the interim. when studied without any medication he had fasting hyperglycemia of 175–200 mg100 ml. an intravenous tolbutamide test was diabetic. when repeated following intravenous propranolol, 10 mg, the insulin response to tolbutamide was diminished. without propranolol or hypoglycemic therapy, fasting hyperglycemia increased over 5–6 wk to 630 mg100 ml, with traces of ketonemia, ffa level of 1350 μeq/liter and serum osmolarity of 305 mosm/kg. the study was later repeated with the addition of oral propranolol 240 mg daily. uncontrolled diabetes was again clinically manifest, although glucose levels rose more slowly. despite fasting glucose levels reaching 930 mg100 ml, no sign of ketosis occurred when the patient was taking propranolol. ffa level at this time was only 640 μeq/liter and serum osmolarity had risen to 335 mosm/kg. his diabetes is now satisfactorily treated with insulin injections, to avoid the disturbances of carbohydrate metabolism caused by propranolol. these studies indicate that large amounts of propranolol may precipitate hyperosmolar nonketotic coma in an untreated diabetic by a blockade of lipolysis and/or impairment of insulin response.
the impact of using different lossy compression algorithms on the recognition accuracy of iris recognition systems is investigated. in particular, we consider the general purpose still image compression algorithms jpeg, jpeg2000, spiht, and prvq and assess their impact on roc of two different iris recognition systems when applying compression to iris sample data. the resilience of identity verification systems to subsampling and compression of human iris images is investigated for three high performance iris matching algorithms. for evaluation, 2156 images from 308 eyes are mapped into a rectangular format with 512 pixels circumferentially and 80 radially. for identity verification, the 48 rows nearest the pupil were taken and the images were subsampled by fourier domain processing. negligible degradation in verification is observed if at least 171 circumferential and 16 radial fourier coefficients are preserved, corresponding to sampling at 342 by 32 pixels. with compression by jpeg 2000, improved performance is observed down to 0.3 bpp, attributed to noise reduction without significant loss of texture. to ensure that no algorithm is degraded, it is recommended that normalized iris images should be exchanged at 512 times 80 pixel resolution, compressed by jpeg 2000 to 0.5 bpp. this achieves a smaller file size than the proposed m1 biometric data interchange format
backgroundidentification of the first de novo mutation in potassium voltage-gated channel, shal-related subfamily, member 3 (kcnd3) in a patient with complex early onset cerebellar ataxia in order to expand the genetic and phenotypic spectrum.methodswhole exome sequencing in a cerebellar ataxia patient and subsequent immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting and patch clamp assays of the channel were performed.resultsa de novo kcnd3 mutation (c.877_885dupcgcgtcttc; p.arg293_phe295dup) was found duplicating the rvf motif and thereby adding an extra positive charge to voltage-gated potassium 4.3 (kv4.3) in the voltage-sensor domain causing a severe shift of the voltage-dependence gating to more depolarized voltages. the patient displayed a severe phenotype with early onset cerebellar ataxia complicated by intellectual disability, epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, strabismus, oral apraxia and joint hyperlaxity.conclusionswe identified a de novo kcnd3 mutation causing the most marked change in kv4.3’s channel properties reported so far, which correlated with a severe and unique spinocerebellar ataxia (sca) type 19/22 disease phenotype. to identify the causative gene for the neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 19 (sca19) located on chromosomal region 1p21‐q21.
diverse extrinsic and intrinsic cues must be integrated within a developing organism to ensure appropriate growth at the cellular and organismal level. in drosophila, the insulin receptor/tor/s6k signaling network plays a fundamental role in the control of metabolism and cell growth. here we show that scylla and charybdis, two homologous genes identified as growth suppressors in an ep (enhancer/promoter) overexpression screen, act as negative regulators of growth. the simultaneous loss of both genes generates flies that are more susceptible to reduced oxygen concentrations (hypoxia) and that show mild overgrowth phenotypes. conversely, scylla or charybdis overactivation reduces growth. growth inhibition is associated with a reduction in s6k but not pkb/akt activity. together, genetic and biochemical analysis places scylla/charybdis downstream of pkb and upstream of tsc. furthermore, we show that scylla and charybdis are induced under hypoxic conditions and that scylla is a target of drosophila hif-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1) like its mammalian counterpart rtp801/redd1, thus establishing a potential cross-talk between growth and oxygen sensing. doi:10.1101/gad.322704 2004 18: 2879-2892; originally published online nov 15, 2004; genes & dev. jan h. reiling and ernst hafen drosophila by down-regulating s6k activity upstream of tsc in the hypoxia-induced paralogs scylla and charybdis inhibit growth data supplementary http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/full/gad.322704/dc1 "supplemental research data" the inherited human disease tuberous sclerosis, characterized by hamartomatous tumors, results from mutations in either tsc1 or tsc2. we have characterized mutations in the drosophila tsc1 and tsc2/gigas genes. inactivating mutations in either gene cause an identical phenotype characterized by enhanced growth and increased cell size with no change in ploidy. overall, mutant cells spend less time in g1. coexpression of both tsc1 and tsc2 restricts tissue growth and reduces cell size and cell proliferation. this phenotype is modulated by manipulations in cyclin levels. in postmitotic mutant cells, levels of cyclin e and cyclin a are elevated. this correlates with a tendency for these cells to reenter the cell cycle inappropriately as is observed in the human lesions.
multiple pathways participate in the ampa receptor trafficking that underlies long-term potentiation (ltp) of synaptic transmission. here we demonstrate that protein sumoylation is required for insertion of the glua1 ampar subunit following transient glycine-evoked increase in ampa receptor surface expression (chemltp) in dispersed neuronal cultures. chemltp increases co-localisation of sumo-1 and the sumo conjugating enzyme ubc9 and with psd95 consistent with the recruitment of sumoylated proteins to dendritic spines. in addition, we show that chemltp increases dendritic levels of sumo-1 and ubc9 mrna. consistent with activity dependent translocation of these mrnas to sites near synapses, levels of the mrna binding and dendritic transport protein cpeb are also increased by chemltp. importantly, reducing the extent of substrate protein sumoylation by overexpressing the desumoylating enzyme senp-1 or inhibiting sumoylation by expressing dominant negative ubc9 prevent the chemltp-induced increase in both ampar surface expression and dendritic sumo-1 mrna. taken together these data demonstrate that sumoylation of synaptic protein(s) involved in ampa receptor trafficking is necessary for activity-dependent increases in ampar surface expression. induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (ltp) requires activation of ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii), whereas maintenance of ltp additionally requires protein synthesis. we recently reported that camkii stimulates protein synthesis in depolarized hippocampal neurons through phosphorylation of the mrna translation factor cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (cpeb), and this phosphorylation is rapidly reversed by protein phosphatase 1 (pp1). protein synthesis-dependent late-phase ltp (l-ltp) in the hippocampus requires calcium influx through the nmda-type glutamate receptor (nmda-r) to activate camkii as well as concomitant inhibition of pp1 mediated by protein kinase a. therefore, we investigated the regulation of cpeb phosphorylation during l-ltp. pharmacological stimulation of the nmda-r in hippocampal slices to produce chemical long-term depression induced a brief dephosphorylation of cpeb. modest ltp induction (once at 100 hz), which induces a protein synthesis-independent early-phase ltp (e-ltp), resulted in a transient phosphorylation of cpeb. however, stronger stimulation (four times at 100 hz), known to induce protein synthesis-dependent l-ltp, elicited a prolonged phosphorylation of cpeb. furthermore, cpeb phosphorylation correlated with phosphorylation of pp1 inhibitor dopamine- and camp-regulated phosphoprotein, a known substrate for protein kinase a. these results evoke the hypothesis that bidirectional regulation of cpeb phosphorylation by camkii and protein phosphatases may serve as a mechanism to convert e-ltp into protein synthesis-dependent l-ltp by stimulating protein synthesis and thereby stabilizing synaptic enhancement.
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) has heterogeneous clinical and biological behavior. whole-genome and -exome sequencing has contributed to the characterization of the mutational spectrum of the disease, but the underlying transcriptional profile is still poorly understood. we have performed deep rna sequencing in different subpopulations of normal b-lymphocytes and cll cells from a cohort of 98 patients, and characterized the cll transcriptional landscape with unprecedented resolution. we detected thousands of transcriptional elements differentially expressed between the cll and normal b cells, including protein-coding genes, noncoding rnas, and pseudogenes. transposable elements are globally derepressed in cll cells. in addition, two thousand genes-most of which are not differentially expressed-exhibit cll-specific splicing patterns. genes involved in metabolic pathways showed higher expression in cll, while genes related to spliceosome, proteasome, and ribosome were among the most down-regulated in cll. clustering of the cll samples according to rna-seq derived gene expression levels unveiled two robust molecular subgroups, c1 and c2. c1/c2 subgroups and the mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy variable (ighv) region were the only independent variables in predicting time to treatment in a multivariate analysis with main clinico-biological features. this subdivision was validated in an independent cohort of patients monitored through dna microarrays. further analysis shows that b-cell receptor (bcr) activation in the microenvironment of the lymph node may be at the origin of the c1/c2 differences. noncoding rnas transcribed from dna repeats in heterochromatin are expressed at surprisingly high levels in tumors. satellite repeats in heterochromatin are transcribed into noncoding rnas that have been linked to gene silencing and maintenance of chromosomal integrity. using digital gene expression analysis, we showed that these transcripts are greatly overexpressed in mouse and human epithelial cancers. in 8 of 10 mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (pdacs), pericentromeric satellites accounted for a mean 12% (range 1 to 50%) of all cellular transcripts, a mean 40-fold increase over that in normal tissue. in 15 of 15 human pdacs, alpha satellite transcripts were most abundant and hsatii transcripts were highly specific for cancer. similar patterns were observed in cancers of the lung, kidney, ovary, colon, and prostate. derepression of satellite transcripts correlated with overexpression of the long interspersed nuclear element 1 (line-1) retrotransposon and with aberrant expression of neuroendocrine-associated genes proximal to line-1 insertions. the overexpression of satellite transcripts in cancer may reflect global alterations in heterochromatin silencing and could potentially be useful as a biomarker for cancer detection.
pattern formation along the animal-vegetal (av) axis in sea urchin embryos is initiated when canonical wnt (cwnt) signaling is activated in vegetal blastomeres. the mechanisms that restrict cwnt signaling to vegetal blastomeres are not well understood, but there is increasing evidence that the egg’s vegetal cortex plays a critical role in this process by mediating localized “activation” of disheveled (dsh). to investigate how dsh activity is regulated along the av axis, sea urchin-specific dsh antibodies were used to examine expression, subcellular localization, and post-translational modification of dsh during development. dsh is broadly expressed during early sea urchin development, but immunolocalization studies revealed that this protein is enriched in a punctate pattern in a novel vegetal cortical domain (vcd) in the egg. vegetal blastomeres inherit this vcd during embryogenesis, and at the 60-cell stage dsh puncta are seen in all cells that display nuclear β-catenin. analysis of dsh post-translational modification using two-dimensional western blot analysis revealed that compared to dsh pools in the bulk cytoplasm, this protein is differentially modified in the vcd and in the 16-cell stage micromeres that partially inherit this domain. dsh localization to the vcd is not directly affected by disruption of microfilaments and microtubules, but unexpectedly, microfilament disruption led to degradation of all the dsh pools in unfertilized eggs over a period of incubation suggesting that microfilament integrity is required for maintaining dsh stability. these results demonstrate that a pool of differentially modified dsh in the vcd is selectively inherited by the vegetal blastomeres that activate cwnt signaling in early embryos, and suggests that this domain functions as a scaffold for localized dsh activation. localized cwnt activation regulates av axis patterning in many metazoan embryos. hence, it is possible that the vcd is an evolutionarily conserved cytoarchitectural domain that specifies the av axis in metazoan ova. the dishevelled protein regulates many developmental processes in animals ranging from hydra to humans. here, we discuss the various known signaling activities of this enigmatic protein and focus on the biological processes that dishevelled controls. through its many signaling activities, dishevelled plays important roles in the embryo and the adult, ranging from cell-fate specification and cell polarity to social behavior. dishevelled also has important roles in the governance of polarized cell divisions, in the directed migration of individual cells, and in cardiac development and neuronal structure and function.
nociceptors are specialized high-threshold sensory afferents from dorsal root ganglion (drg) or other primary sensory (e.g., trigeminal) neurons that innervate the skin, muscle, joints, and viscera and respond to noxious or potentially damaging stimuli. nociceptors express a unique repertoire of voltage-gated sodium (na+) channels (nav), potassium (k+) and calcium (ca2+) channels, as well as cation channels of the transient receptor potential (trp), acid-sensing ion channel (asic), and purinergic p2x families. these channels are responsible for the basic properties of nociceptors, including the lack of spontaneous activity and high threshold of activation. products of inflammation or axonal injury trigger changes in the expression and function of these channels, resulting in increased excitability (reduced threshold of activation) of nociceptors. this process, known as peripheral nociceptor sensitization, manifests with spontaneous nociceptor activity (resulting in spontaneous pain), increased responsiveness and size of receptor fields for noxious stimulation (primary and secondary hyperalgesia), and nociceptor responses to innocuous mechanical or thermal stimuli (allodynia). these features characterize neuropathic and inflammatory pain. the wide variety of chemical signals that elicit nociceptor sensitization act via several types of receptors expressed in nociceptors, including g-protein-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors, which affect the expression or sensitivity of cation channels, particularly nav1.7, nav1.8, nav1.9, trp vanilloid 1 (trpv1), and trp ankyrin 1 (trpa1) channels. gain-of-function mutations affecting these channels are linked to familial syndromes characterized by episodic pain sporadic painful small fiber neuropathies (sfn); loss-of function mutations are associated with congenital insensitivity to pain. there are extensive and excellent reviews on all these subjects.1–15 painful peripheral neuropathy often occurs without apparent underlying cause. gain-of-function variants of sodium channel nav1.7 have recently been found in ∼30% of cases of idiopathic painful small-fiber neuropathy. here, we describe mutations in nav1.8, another sodium channel that is specifically expressed in dorsal root ganglion (drg) neurons and peripheral nerve axons, in patients with painful neuropathy. seven nav1.8 mutations were identified in 9 subjects within a series of 104 patients with painful predominantly small-fiber neuropathy. three mutations met criteria for potential pathogenicity based on predictive algorithms and were assessed by voltage and current clamp. functional profiling showed that two of these three nav1.8 mutations enhance the channel’s response to depolarization and produce hyperexcitability in drg neurons. these observations suggest that mutations of nav1.8 contribute to painful peripheral neuropathy.
background low tri-iodothyronine syndrome is associated with worse prognosis of severely ill patients. we investigated the association of thyroid hormone levels with discharge outcomes and 5-year mortality in primary brain tumor patients. methods from january, 2010 until september, 2011, 230 patients (70% women) before brain tumor surgery were evaluated for cognitive (mini mental state examination; mmse) and functional (barthel index; bi) status, and thyroid function profile. the low triiodothyronine syndrome was defined as triiodothyronine concentration below the reference range. unfavorable discharge outcomes were glasgow outcome scale score of ≤3. follow-up continued until november, 2015. results seventy-four percent of patients had low triiodothyronine syndrome. lower total tri-iodothyronine concentrations were associated with lower mmse (p=.013) and bi (p=.023) scores independent of age, gender and histological diagnosis. preoperative low tri-iodothyronine syndrome increased risk for unfavorable discharge outcomes adjusting for age, gender and histological diagnosis (or=2.944, 95%ci [1.314-6.597], p=.009). in all patients, lower tri-iodothyronine concentrations were associated with greater mortality risk (p≤.038) adjusting for age, gender, extent of resection, adjuvant treatment and histological diagnosis. the low tri-iodothyronine syndrome was associated with greater 5-year mortality for glioma patients (hr=2.197; 95%ci [1.160-4.163], p=.016) and with shorter survival (249 [260] vs. 352 [399] days; p=.029) of high grade glioma patients independent of age, gender, extent of resection and adjuvant treatment. conclusions the low tri-iodothyronine syndrome is common in brain tumor patients and is associated with poor functional and cognitive status, and with worse discharge outcomes. the low tri-iodothyronine syndrome is associated with shorter survival of glioma patients. this study aims to evaluate the incidence of non-thyroid illness syndrome (ntis) among patients diagnosed as lung cancer and its association with the stage of the disease, eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance score, nutritional parameters, and survival. we enrolled 120 patients that 71 of them with newly diagnosed and staged non-small cell lung cancer and 49 of them small-cell lung cancer. the cases were examined for thyroid function tests, ecog performance score, and nutritional evaluation before treatment. also, cases were evaluated for their overall survival rates. ntis was identified in 30 (42 %) of the 71 non-small cell lung cancer patients and 22 (44 %) of the 49 small-cell lung cancer patients. ntis was more frequent among advanced stage of cases. serum albumin level, cholesterol level, lymphocyte level, and body mass index were detected to be significantly low and ecog performance score was significantly high in cases with ntis when compared to cases without ntis. ntis was found to be negatively correlated with body mass index, ecog performance score, and serum albumin level, and it was positively correlated with disease stage. ntis was detected significantly as a poor prognostic factor for lung cancer. ntis was frequently seen in cases with non-small cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer. ntis can be used as a predictor of poor prognosis for lung cancer patients.
time-resolved fourier transform infrared (ftir) difference spectra of the halorhodopsin (hr) photocycle have been collected from 3 micros to 100 ms in saturating concentrations of kcl or kbr. kinetic analysis of these data revealed two decay processes, with time constants of tau(1) approximately 150 micros and tau(2) approximately 16 ms in the presence of either halide, with tau(2) describing the return to the starting (hr) state. comparison to previous low-temperature ftir spectra of hr intermediates confirms that characteristic hk and hl spectral features are both present before the tau(1) decay, in a state previously defined as hk(l) (dioumaev, a., and m. braiman. 1997. photochem. photobiol. 66:755-763). however, the relative sizes of these features depend on which halide is present. in br-, the hl features are clearly more dominant than in cl-. therefore, the state present before tau(1) is probably best described as an hk(l)/hl(1) equilibrium, instead of a single hk(l) state. different halides affect the relative amounts of hk(l) and hl(1) present, i.e., cl- produces a much more significant back-reaction from hl(1) to hk(l) than does br-. the halide dependence of this back-reaction could therefore explain the halide selectivity of the halorhodopsin anion pump. abstract— step‐scan fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with 50 ns time resolution was applied to the early stages of the photocycle of halorhodopsin (hr) for the temperature range 3‐42° c. kinetic data analysis with global fitting revealed two distinct kinetic processes associated with relaxations of the early red‐shifted photoproduct hk; these processes have time constants t1⋍ 280 ns and t2⋍ 360 μs at 20°c. spectral features demonstrate that the t1 process corresponds to a transition between two distinct bathointermediates, hke and hkl. the vibrational difference bands associated with both t1 and t2 transitions are spread throughout the whole 1800‐900 cm−1 range. however, the largest bands correspond to ethylenic c=c stretches, fingerprint c‐c stretches and hydrogen out‐of‐plane (hoop) wags of the retinal chromophore. the time evolution of these difference bands indicate that both the t1 and t2 decay processes involve principally a relaxation of the chromophore and its immediate environment. the decay of the intense hoop vibrations is nearly equally divided between the t1 and t2 processes, indicating a complex chromophore relaxation from a twisted nonrelaxed conformation in the primary (hke) bathointermediate, to a less‐twisted structure in hkl, and finally to a roughly planar structure in the hypsochromically shifted hl intermediate. this conclusion is also supported by the unexpectedly large positive entropy of activation observed for the t1 process. the two relaxations from hke to hl are largely analogous to corresponding relaxations (ke→ kl→ l) in the bacterior‐hodopsin photocycle, except that the second step is slowed down by over 200‐fold in hr.
ciliary neurotrophic factor (cntf) has been shown to be expressed after brain lesions and in particular after demyelination. here, we addressed the role of this cytokine in the regulation of neural progenitor migration in the adult rodent brain. using an acute model of demyelination, we show that cntf is strongly re-expressed after lesion and is involved in the postlesional mobilization of endogenous progenitors that participate in the myelin regenerative process. we show that cntf controls the migration of subventricular zone (svz)-derived neural progenitors toward the demyelinated corpus callosum. furthermore, an ectopic source of cntf in adult healthy brains changes svz-derived neural progenitors' migratory behavior that migrate toward the source by activation of the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (jak/stat3) pathway. using various in vitro assays (boyden chambers, explants, and video time-lapse imaging), we demonstrate that cntf controls the directed migration of svz-derived progenitors and oligodendrocyte precursors. altogether, these results demonstrate that in addition to its neuroprotective activity and its role in progenitor survival and maturation, cntf acts as a chemoattractant and participates in the recruitment of endogenous progenitors during myelin repair. in rodents, the adult subventricular zone (svz) generates neuroblasts which migrate to the olfactory bulb (ob) and differentiate into interneurons. recent work suggests that the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) can enhance adult svz neurogenesis, but the mechanism by which it acts is unknown. here, we analyzed the role of bdnf and its receptor trkb in adult svz neurogenesis. we found that trkb is the most prominent neurotrophin receptor in the mouse svz, but only the truncated, kinase-negative isoform (trkb-tr) was detected. trkb-tr is expressed in svz astrocytes and ependymal cells, but not in neuroblasts. trkb mutants have reduced svz proliferation and survival and fewer new ob neurons. to test whether this effect is cell-autonomous, we grafted svz cells from trkb knock-out mice (trkb-ko) into the svz of wild-type mice (wt). grafted progenitors generated neuroblasts that migrated to the ob in the absence of trkb. the survival and differentiation of granular interneurons and calbindin+ periglomerular interneurons seemed unaffected by the loss of trkb, whereas dopaminergic periglomerular neurons were reduced. intra-ventricular infusion of bdnf yielded different results depending on the animal species, having no effect on neuron production from mouse svz, while decreasing it in rats. interestingly, mice and rats also differ in their expression of the neurotrophin receptor p75. our results indicate that trkb is not essential for adult svz neurogenesis and do not support the current view that delivering bdnf to the svz can enhance adult neurogenesis.
aberrant wnt signaling due to deregulation of wnt regulators is implicated in the development and progression of numerous embryonal tumors. this study addresses the questions if activation of wnt signaling in germ cell tumors (gcts) arising during childhood and adolescence is associated with aberrations of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (apc), and whether apc aberrations might be responsible for progression from benign teratoma to malignant yolk sac tumor (yst). chromosomal instability (cin), a hallmark of most colon tumors, may promote tumor progression by increasing the rate of genetic aberrations. cin is thought to arise as a consequence of improper mitosis and spindle checkpoint activity, but its molecular basis remains largely elusive. the majority of colon tumors develop because of mutations in the tumor suppressor apc that lead to wnt/beta-catenin signaling activation and subsequent transcription of target genes, including conductin/axin2. here we demonstrate that wnt/beta-catenin signaling causes cin via up-regulation of conductin. human colon tumor samples with cin show significantly higher expression of conductin than those without. conductin is up-regulated during mitosis, localizes along the mitotic spindles of colon cancer cells, and binds to polo-like kinase 1. ectopic expression of conductin or its up-regulation through small interfering rna-mediated knock-down of apc leads to cin in chromosomally stable colon cancer cells. high conductin expression compromises the spindle checkpoint, and this requires localized polo-like kinase 1 activity. knock-down of conductin by small interfering rna in colon carcinoma cells or gene ablation in mouse embryo fibroblasts enforces the checkpoint.
purpose. to describe a reliable method of predicting native joint line and posterior condylar offset (pco) using true lateral digital radiographs of the distal femur. methods. pco was measured relative to a line drawn parallel to the posterior cortex of the distal femur and the joint line was measured from the posterior condylar flare to the articular surface. a ratio was then calculated for these measurements relative to the width of the femur at the level of the flare. two independent observers measured pco and joint line ratio for 105 radiographs of the different knees and one repeated these measurements after one week. results. there was a significant correlation between the width of the femoral diaphysis at the level of the posterior condylar flare with joint line (p = 0.008) and pco (p = 0.003). joint line and pco could be predicted within 4 mm and 2 mm, respectively, using the identified ratio between the width of the femoral diaphysis at the level of the posterior condylar flare with measured joint line and pco. the inter- (p < 0.001) and intra- (p < 0.001) observer reliability for these ratios were high. conclusion. these ratios could be used to predict the native joint line and pco. in 99 patients, 107 knee replacements were revised in two centers by two surgeons using a single revision total knee arthroplasty system. a retrospective radiographic review of joint line position before and after revision total knee arthroplasty was made, and compared with the joint line position before primary knee arthroplasty. prospectively collected knee society clinical rating scores were correlated with radiographic findings. the joint line position in unreplaced knee replacements averaged 16 mm, and the joint line position in knee replacements before revision surgery averaged 17 mm. the joint line was elevated by the revision total knee arthroplasty in 85 of 107 knees (79%). after the revision total knee replacement, the joint line elevation averaged 24 mm. the knee society clinical rating score after revision surgery averaged 131 points. if the joint line position was elevated more than 8 mm, the knee society clinical rating score averaged 125 points, if the joint line was elevated less than 8 mm, the score averaged 141 points. joint line elevation after revision total knee replacement is a problem. excessive elevation may result in worse clinical outcomes. distal femoral augments should be used more often and with greater thicknesses. standard implants used for revision surgery should have increased distal dimensions.
hippocampal lesions in rodents impair both object-place and odor-place associative memory. subjects with hippocampal damage have impaired associative memory such as object-place memory. whereas studies have investigated some types of associative memory, no investigation has specifically examined odor-place associative memory in subjects with well-defined amnesia. it is unknown whether amnesic subjects with hippocampal damage would be impaired on an odor-place associative task. we investigated the effect of hippocampal damage in amnesic subjects with hippocampal atrophy on odor-place associative memory and recognition memory tasks. amnesic and healthy comparison subjects matched for age and education were tested on an odor-place associative task, an odor recognition task, and a place recognition task. the odor-place associative task required subjects to associate 6 odors with 6 spatial locations on a board. the recognition tasks required subjects to identify the 6 odors and the 6 locations that were presented during the associative task. amnesic subjects were impaired for odor-place memory and place recognition, but not odor recognition compared with comparison subjects. these results suggest that the human hippocampus is necessary for odor-place associative memory and spatial recognition memory. these data provide support for the idea that odor-place associative memory is mediated by the hippocampus in both humans and rodents, suggesting an evolutionary continuity in cognitive function assigned to the hippocampus. topographical disorientation (td) refers to impaired orientation and navigation in real-world environments. although numerous cases have been reported, disagreement over neuroanatomical correlates remains. this has been contributed to by concern with the "essential defect," ambiguous terminology, and incomplete assessments. attention to three factors permits a coherent understanding of the widely divergent descriptions of cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical findings: point in course (acute vs. chronic), characteristics of the environment, and a patient's specific cognitive deficits. defects in visual learning/recognition of topographical scenes or spatial-topographical knowledge are common, but the "agnosia" versus "amnesia" dichotomy is an oversimplification: careful assessment typically reveals impairment in both realms. anterograde td is most highly associated with medial occipitotemporal lesions in either hemisphere, especially posterior parahippocampal gyrus, whereas td consequent to right parietal damage tends to be time-limited. persistent retrograde td is attributable to right medial occipitotemporal lesions.
although the braf inhibitors dabrafenib and vemurafenib have both proven successful against braf‐mutant melanoma, there seem to be differences in their mechanisms of action. here, we show that dabrafenib is more effective at inhibiting the growth of nras‐mutant and kras‐mutant cancer cell lines than vemurafenib. using mass spectrometry‐based chemical proteomics, we identified nek9 and cdk16 as unique targets of dabrafenib. both nek9 and cdk16 were highly expressed in specimens of advanced melanoma, with high expression of both proteins correlating with a worse overall survival. a role for nek9 in the growth of nras‐ and kras‐mutant cell lines was suggested by sirna studies in which silencing was associated with decreased proliferation, cell cycle arrest associated with increased p21 expression, inhibition of phospho‐chk1, decreased cdk4 expression, and the initiation of a senescence response. inhibition of cdk4 but not chk1 recapitulated the effects of nek9 silencing, indicating this to be the likely mechanism of growth inhibition. we next turned our attention to cdk16 and found that its knockdown inhibited the phosphorylation of the rb protein at s780 and increased expression of p27. both of these effects were phenocopied in nras‐ and kras‐mutant cancer cells by dabrafenib, but not vemurafenib. combined silencing of nek9 and cdk16 was associated with enhanced inhibition of melanoma cell proliferation. in summary, we have identified dabrafenib as a potent inhibitor of nek9 and cdk16, and our studies suggest that inhibition of these kinases may have activity against cancers that do not harbor braf mutations. braf inhibitors elicit rapid antitumor responses in the majority of patients with braf(v600)-mutant melanoma, but acquired drug resistance is almost universal. we sought to identify the core resistance pathways and the extent of tumor heterogeneity during disease progression. we show that mitogen-activated protein kinase reactivation mechanisms were detected among 70% of disease-progressive tissues, with ras mutations, mutant braf amplification, and alternative splicing being most common. we also detected pi3k-pten-akt-upregulating genetic alterations among 22% of progressive melanomas. distinct molecular lesions in both core drug escape pathways were commonly detected concurrently in the same tumor or among multiple tumors from the same patient. beyond harboring extensively heterogeneous resistance mechanisms, melanoma regrowth emerging from braf inhibitor selection displayed branched evolution marked by altered mutational spectra/signatures and increased fitness. thus, melanoma genomic heterogeneity contributes significantly to braf inhibitor treatment failure, implying upfront, cotargeting of two core pathways as an essential strategy for durable responses.
introductiontamoxifen is one of the most effective adjuvant breast cancer therapies available. its metabolism involves the phase i enzyme, cytochrome p4502d6 (cyp2d6), encoded by the highly polymorphic cyp2d6 gene. cyp2d6 variants resulting in poor metabolism of tamoxifen are hypothesised to reduce its efficacy. an fda-approved pre-treatment cyp2d6 gene testing assay is available. however, evidence from published studies evaluating cyp2d6 variants as predictive factors of tamoxifen efficacy and clinical outcome are conflicting, querying the clinical utility of cyp2d6 testing. we investigated the association of cyp2d6 variants with breast cancer specific survival (bcss) in breast cancer patients receiving tamoxifen.methodsthis was a population based case-cohort study. we genotyped known functional variants (n = 7; minor allele frequency (maf) > 0.01) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) (n = 5; maf > 0.05) tagging all known common variants (tagsnps), in cyp2d6 in 6640 dna samples from patients with invasive breast cancer from search (studies of epidemiology and risk factors in cancer heredity); 3155 cases had received tamoxifen therapy. there were 312 deaths from breast cancer, in the tamoxifen treated patients, with over 18000 years of cumulative follow-up. the association between genotype and bcss was evaluated using cox proportional hazards regression analysis.resultsin tamoxifen treated patients, there was weak evidence that the poor-metaboliser variant, cyp2d6*6 (maf = 0.01), was associated with decreased bcss (p = 0.02; hr = 1.95; 95% ci = 1.12-3.40). no other variants, including cyp2d6*4 (maf = 0.20), previously reported to be associated with poorer clinical outcomes, were associated with differences in bcss, in either the tamoxifen or non-tamoxifen groups.conclusionscyp2d6*6 may affect bcss in tamoxifen-treated patients. however, the absence of an association with survival in more frequent variants, including cyp2d6*4, questions the validity of the reported association between cyp2d6 genotype and treatment response in breast cancer. until larger, prospective studies confirming any associations are available, routine cyp2d6 genetic testing should not be used in the clinical setting. purpose polymorphisms in tamoxifen metabolizing genes affect the plasma concentration of tamoxifen metabolites, but their effect on clinical outcome is unknown.   methods we determined cytochrome p450 (cyp)2d6 (*4 and *6) and cyp3a5 (*3) genotype from paraffin-embedded tumor samples and buccal cells (living patients) in tamoxifen-treated women enrolled onto a north central cancer treatment group adjuvant breast cancer trial. the relationship between genotype and disease outcome was determined using the log-rank test and cox proportional hazards modeling.   results paraffin blocks were obtained from 223 of 256 eligible patients, and buccal cells were obtained from 17 living women. cyp2d6 (*4 and *6) and cyp3a5 (*3) genotypes were determined from 190, 194, and 205 patient samples and in 17 living women. the concordance rate between buccal and tumor genotype was 100%. women with the cyp2d6 *4/*4 genotype had worse relapse-free time (rf-time; p = .023) and disease-free survival (dfs; p = .012), but not overall survival (p = .169) and did not experience moderate to severe hot flashes relative to women heterozygous or homozygous for the wild-type allele. in the multivariate analysis, women with the cyp2d6 *4/*4 genotype still tended to have worse rfs (hazard ratio [hr], 1.85; p = .176) and dfs (hr, 1.86; p = .089). the cyp3a5*3 variant was not associated with any of these clinical outcomes.   conclusion in tamoxifen-treated patients, women with the cyp2d6 *4/*4 genotype tend to have a higher risk of disease relapse and a lower incidence of hot flashes, which is consistent with our previous observation that cyp2d6 is responsible for the metabolic activation of tamoxifen to endoxifen.
the dna repair proteins poly(adp-ribose) polymerase-1 (parp-1), ku86, and catalytic subunit of dna-pk (dna-pkcs) have been involved in telomere metabolism. to genetically dissect the impact of these activities on telomere function, as well as organismal cancer and aging, we have generated mice doubly deficient for both telomerase and any of the mentioned dna repair proteins, parp-1, ku86, or dna-pkcs. first, we show that abrogation of parp-1 in the absence of telomerase does not affect the rate of telomere shortening, telomere capping, or organismal viability compared with single telomerase-deficient controls. thus, parp-1 does not have a major role in telomere metabolism, not even in the context of telomerase deficiency. in contrast, mice doubly deficient for telomerase and either ku86 or dna-pkcs manifest accelerated loss of organismal viability compared with single telomerase-deficient mice. interestingly, this loss of organismal viability correlates with proliferative defects and age-related pathologies, but not with increased incidence of cancer. these results support the notion that absence of telomerase and short telomeres in combination with dna repair deficiencies accelerate the aging process without impacting on tumorigenesis. how a cell deals with its dna ends is a question that returns us to the very beginnings of modern telomere biology. it is also a question we are still asking today because it is absolutely essential that a cell correctly distinguishes between natural chromosomal dna ends and broken dna ends, then processes each appropriately – preserving the one, rejoining the other. effective end-capping of mammalian telomeres has a seemingly paradoxical requirement for proteins more commonly associated with dna double strand break (dsb) repair. ku70, ku80, dna-pkcs (the catalytic subunit of dna-dependent protein kinase), xrcc4 and artemis all participate in dsb repair through nonhomologous end-joining (nhej). somewhat surprisingly, mutations in any of these genes cause spontaneous chromosomal end-to-end fusions that maintain large blocks of telomeric sequence at the points of fusion, suggesting loss or failure of a critical terminal structure, rather than telomere shortening, is at fault. nascent telomeres produced via leading-strand dna synthesis are especially susceptible to these end-to-end fusions, suggesting a crucial difference in the postreplicative processing of telomeres that is linked to their mode of replication. here we will examine the dual roles played by dna repair proteins. our review of this rapidly advancing field primarily will focus on mammalian cells, and cannot include even all of this. despite these limitations, we hope the review will serve as a useful gateway to the literature, and will help to frame the major issues in this exciting and rapidly progressing field. our apologies to those whose work we are unable to include.
introductiongiant cavernous malformations (gcm) are very large, low-flow vascular malformations, which usually have atypical imaging features and are commonly misdiagnosed preoperatively as neoplasms or vascular malformations. these lesions have mostly been reported in children. as cavernomas show different features in children compared to adults, we evaluated the imaging features of pediatric gcms in order to help in the preoperative diagnosis of these malformations.methodsbrain mr studies of nine children (mean age of 4 years; 8 months–9 years) with biopsy-proven gcm were retrospectively evaluated. we defined gcms as cavernomas of ≥4 cm. lesions were evaluated regarding their size, location, signal characteristics, general appearance (uni/multilocular) as well as regarding the presence of mass effect, edema, and fluid–fluid levels and were classified according to the mottolese classification of pediatric cavernomas.resultslesion locations were parietal (n = 5), frontal (n = 2), temporal, and intraventricular. seven lesions were in the periventricular region (with five in the periatrial region). six patients had t1 hyperintense multilobulated lesions with “bubbles of blood” appearance and three patients had heterogeneous lesions with reticular core. all lesions had mass effect, edema (marked in four cases), and peripheral hemosiderin rim. fluid–fluid levels were also common (n = 7). most of our lesions (six of nine) were classified as type iiia, two as type iiic, and one as type ia.conclusionin children, a gcm should be considered in case of very large hemorrhagic intra-axial mass with “bubbles of blood” multicystic appearance, surrounding hemosiderin ring, fluid–fluid levels, and accompanying edema–mass effect, especially in the periatrial location. cavernous angiomas of the central nervous system are angiographically occult vascular lesions and are easily diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (mri). giant cavernous angiomas (gca) are rare, with only 11 cases reported in the literature. imaging appearance of gcas has not been reviewed previously. we report a gca of the temporal lobe, and discuss its computed tomography and mri findings in the view of the literature. imaging appearance of gcas is variable. some gcas have features that are similar to those of typical cavernous angiomas, whereas some lesions may be purely cystic; and some present with significant contrast enhancement and mass effect, mimicking neoplasms. while the presence of hemosiderin, blood degradation products, and calcification may be helpful in the diagnosis of some cases, the correct diagnosis is not apparent until histopathological evaluation of the specimen is made in many instances.
increasing evidence supports the involvement of immune and inflammatory processes in the etiopathogenesis of seizures. in particular, activation of innate immune mechanisms and the subsequent inflammatory responses, that are induced in the brain by infection, febrile seizures, neurotrauma, stroke are well documented conditions associated with acute symptomatic seizures and with a high risk of developing epilepsy. a decade ago, pharmacological experiments showed that elevated brain levels of the anti-inflammatory molecule il-1 receptor antagonist reduced seizures in epilepsy models. this observation, together with the evidence of in situ induction of inflammatory mediators and their receptors in experimental and human epileptogenic brain tissue, established the proof-of-concept evidence that the activation of innate immunity and inflammation in the brain are intrinsic features of the pathologic hyperexcitable tissue. recent breakthroughs in understanding the molecular organization of the innate immune system first in macrophages, then in the different cell types of the cns, together with pharmacological and genetic studies in epilepsy models, showed that the activation of il-1 receptor/toll-like receptor (il-1r/tlr) signaling significantly contributes to seizures. il-1r/tlr mediated pro-excitatory actions are elicited in the brain either by mimicking bacterial or viral infections and inflammatory responses, or via the action of endogenous ligands. these ligands include proinflammatory cytokines, such as il-1beta, or danger signals, such as hmgb1, released from activated or injured cells. the il-1r/tlr signaling mediates rapid post-translational changes in voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels that increase excitability, and transcriptional changes in genes involved in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity that contribute to lower seizure thresholds chronically. the anticonvulsant effects of inhibitors of the il-1r/tlr signaling in various seizures models suggest that this system could be targeted to inhibit seizures in presently pharmaco-resistant epilepsies. interleukin (il)-1beta is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in modulating inflammation and stress responses in the brain. central administration of il-1beta impairs both memory functions and long-term potentiation (ltp) induction. however, the molecular events responsible for the downstream effects of il-1beta are not fully understood. given the potential regulatory role of il-1beta in ltp, we assessed whether il-1beta influences surface expression and phosphorylation of glutamate receptors. we found that il-1beta, but not il-10 or tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, down-regulated the surface expression and ser831 phosphorylation of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (ampa) receptor subunit glur1. agents that block il-1beta receptor activity abolished these effects. in contrast, no change in the surface expression of the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor subunit nr1 was observed. the inhibition of nmda receptor activity or depletion of extracellular calcium blocked il-1beta effects on glur1 phosphorylation and surface expression. nmda-mediated calcium influx was also regulated by il-1beta. these findings suggest that il-1beta selectively regulates ampa receptor phosphorylation and surface expression through extracellular calcium and an unknown mechanism involving nmda receptor activity.
difluoromethylornithine (dfmo) is a potent, irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of polyamines that promote cellular proliferation. dfmo has been tested as a potential cancer therapeutic and chemopreventive agent in clinical trials. reversible hearing loss is a recognized toxicity of dfmo that usually occurs at doses above 2 g/m(2)/d, and generally when the cumulative dose exceeds 250 g/m(2). in a recently completed barrett's esophagus chemoprevention trial, a participant developed a 15-db decrease in hearing at frequencies of 250, 2,000, and 3,000 hz in the right ear and a > or =20-db decrease in hearing at 4,000 to 6,000 hz in the left ear after taking 0.5 g/m(2)/d dfmo for approximately 13 weeks (cumulative dose of 45 g/m(2)). the threshold shifts persisted 7 months after dfmo was discontinued. there was no obvious impact on the participant's clinical hearing, but these findings were consistent with irreversible hearing loss. this is the first case reported of irreversible ototoxicity in a clinical trial participant receiving dfmo and, thus, trial participants should be made aware of this small but important risk. this chapter summarizes the reported ototoxicity data on the most clinically important ototoxic chemotherapeutic agents, notably emphasizing the oto(neuro)toxicities of the more commonly administered platinum compounds, cisplatin and carboplatin. currently, in the united states, the only other marketed ototoxic chemotherapeutic agents are nitrogen mustard, alpha-difluoromethyl ornithine (dfmo), and the vinca alkaloids (vincristine and vinblastine sulfate); for these groups, animal ototoxicity data is sparse, and audiovestibular records of human ototoxicity are not available from most prospective, randomized controlled clinical trials. future phase i, ii, and iii clinical oncologic trials of "experimental" chemotherapeutic agents should include methodology for audiovestibular monitoring, just as present fda-approved cancer protocols with either monotherapy or combined therapy of known "ototoxic" agents should include standardized audiovestibular assessment in the database. finally, continued clinical application of cisplatin alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the successful treatment of solid tumors mandates decreasing or eliminating specifically the dose-dependent sensorineural hearing loss (partially in cases of complete or long-term partial remission) in addition to other common antiproliferation-induced side effects (nephritis, peripheral neuropathy, intractable nausea and vomiting, electrolyte imbalance, anaphylactic-like reactions, and myelosuppression). because of the chemotherapeutic superiority of cisplatin, it is essential to continue to investigate methods of altering the dose-limiting oto(neuro)toxicity without causing a "counterproductive" reduction of the antitumor activity of cisplatin (or other second- or third-generation ototoxic platinum agents).
with modern therapies and supportive care, survival rates of childhood cancer have increased considerably. however, there are long-term psychological sequelae of these treatments that may not manifest until pediatric survivors are into adulthood. the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in young adult survivors of childhood cancer ranges from 6.2 to 22%; associated risk factors are young age at the assessment, female gender, low education level, and some disease-related factors. the aim of this study was to investigate, in adolescent and young adult (aya) survivors of childhood cancer, the incidence and severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms (ptsss), and to identify the risk factors and the associated post-traumatic growth (ptg) index. participants were 223 aya cancer survivors recruited during follow-up visits in the oncohematology clinic of the department of child and woman’s health, university of padua. data were collected from self-report questionnaires on ptss incidence, ptg mean score, perceived social support, and medical and socio-demographic factors. ex-patients’ mean age at the assessment was 19.33 years (sd = 3.01, 15–25), 123 males and 100 females, with a mean of years off-therapy of 9.64 (sd = 4.17). most (52.5%) had survived an hematological disorder and 47.5% a solid tumor when they were aged, on average, 8.02 years (sd = 4.40). the main results indicated a moderate presence of clinical (≥9 symptoms: 9.4%) and sub-clinical ptss (6–8 symptoms: 11.2%), with the avoidance criterion most often encountered. re-experience symptoms and ptg mean score were significantly associated (r = 0.24; p = 0.0001). a hierarchical regression model (r2 = 0.08; f = 1.46; p = 0.05) identified female gender (β = 0.16; p = 0.05) and less perceived social support (β = -0.43; p = 0.05) as risk factors to developing ptss. another hierarchical regression model assessed the possible predictors of the ptg total score (r2 = 0.36; f = 9.1; p = 0.0001), with female gender (β = 0.13; p = 0.04), actual age (β = 0.52; p = 0.0001), younger age at the diagnosis (β = -0.3; p = 0.02), and less years off-therapy (β = -0.58; p = 0.0001) impacting on ptg. confronting with a life-threatening illness may serve as an opportunity for self-renewal and spiritual and personal growth. posttraumatic growth refers to the experience of positive change resulting from the struggle and/or cognitive engagement with the existential challenges of life events. the more stressful a life situation is, the more potential it provides for personal growth. this article is a report of a narrative synthesis of empirical research reporting the positive effects of cancer perceived by the childhood cancer survivors and their families. a total of 35 studies included 20 quantitative, 12 qualitative, and 3 mixed studies (involving 2087 childhood cancer survivors, 1115 parents, and 159 healthy siblings). they were published between 1975 and 2010 and conducted in 9 countries. five themes were identified: (1) meaning-making, (2) appreciation of life, (3) self-awareness, (4) closeness and family togetherness, and (5) a desire to pay back society. the findings suggest that illness becomes our best teacher to get to know ourselves at a deeper level and the world in a new dimension with new meaning. working through an illness brings out our best, teaching us what life is all about.
gomishi is the dried fruit of schisandra chinensis baillon (fructus schisandrae chinensis, fsc) and has been used in japanese kampo medicine to treat inflammatory and liver diseases. however, it is unclear which constituent of fsc is primarily responsible for its pharmacological effects. fsc was extracted with methanol, fractionated by hydrophobicity, and further purified. we measured the effects of each fraction or constituent thereof on the induction of the inflammatory mediator nitric oxide (no), which was induced by interleukin 1β in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. the hydrophobic fraction markedly suppressed no induction and reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide syntheses (inos) in interleukin 1β-treated hepatocytes. gomisin n and γ-schizandrin, two major constituents of the hydrophobic fraction, significantly reduced no production and the levels of the inos protein, mrna, and antisense transcript. gomisin n and γ-schizandrin also decreased the transcription of interleukin 1β and inflammatory chemokines. the overexpression of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor κb or ccaat/enhancer-binding protein β increased the promoter activity of the inos gene in the firefly luciferase assay, whereas gomisin n decreased the promoter activity. the anti-inflammatory activity of fsc and its constituents were analysed, and we demonstrated that gomisin n and γ-schizandrin are involved in the hepatoprotective effect of the fsc extract, which has therapeutic potential for liver disease. aim:  a herbal medicine, kampo inchinkoto (tj‐135), is used to treat jaundice and liver fibrosis in patients with cirrhosis. in the inflamed liver, proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) gene expression. over‐production of nitric oxide (no) by inos has been implicated as a factor in liver injury. we examined interleukin (il)‐1β‐stimulated hepatocytes as a simple in vitro injury model to determine liver‐protective effects of tj‐135. the objective was to investigate whether tj‐135 influences inos induction and to determine its mechanism.
radiation-induced genomic instability, in which the progeny of irradiated cells display a high frequency of nonclonal genomic damage, occurs at a frequency inconsistent with mutation. we investigated the mechanism of this nontargeted effect in human mammary epithelial cells (hmec) exposed to low doses of radiation. we identified a centrosome-associated expression signature in irradiated hmec and show here that centrosome deregulation occurs in the first cell cycle after irradiation, is dose dependent, and that viable daughters of these cells are genomically unstable as evidenced by spontaneous dna damage, tetraploidy, and aneuploidy. clonal analysis of genomic instability showed a threshold of >10 cgy. treatment with transforming growth factor beta1 (tgfbeta), which is implicated in regulation of genomic stability and is activated by radiation, reduced both the centrosome expression signature and centrosome aberrations in irradiated hmec. furthermore, tgfbeta inhibition significantly increased centrosome aberration frequency, tetraploidy, and aneuploidy in nonirradiated hmec. rather than preventing radiation-induced or spontaneous centrosome aberrations, tgfbeta selectively deleted unstable cells via p53-dependent apoptosis. together, these studies show that radiation deregulates centrosome stability, which underlies genomic instability in normal human epithelial cells, and that this can be opposed by radiation-induced tgfbeta signaling. centrosome amplification is common in myeloma and may be involved in disease pathogenesis. we have previously derived a gene expression-based centrosome index (ci) that correlated with centrosome amplification and was an independent prognostic factor in a small cohort of heterogeneously treated patients. in this study, we validated the prognostic significance of the ci in 2 large cohorts of patients entered into clinical trials and showed that a high ci is a powerful independent prognostic factor in both newly diagnosed and relapsed patients, whether treated by intensive therapy (total therapy ii) or novel agents (bortezomib). tumors with high ci overexpressed genes coding for proteins involved in cell cycle, proliferation, dna damage, and g(2)-m checkpoints, and associated with the centrosome and kinetochore/ microtubules. in particular, aurora kinases are significantly overexpressed in patients with high ci, with concordant increase in protein expression. human myeloma cell lines with higher ci are more responsive to treatment with a novel aurora kinase inhibitor. aurora kinase may represent novel therapeutic targets in these patients with very poor prognosis.
introduction deficit schizophrenia (ds) is defined for identifying a relatively homogeneous subgroup of patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia, characterized by the presence of primary and enduring negative symptoms. there have been several studies which investigated the status of oxidative stress and total antioxidant level in patients with schizophrenia. however, there is not any study which researched differences between ds and nondeficit schizophrenia (nds) in terms of status of oxidative stress and antioxidant level. we hypothesized that patients with ds would have different status of oxidative stress and antioxidant levels compared with patients with nds.   methods twenty-three patients with ds, 42 patients with nds and 31 age, sex and smoking status matched healthy controls (hc) were included to study. five milliliters of blood was drawn from control subjects and patients for assessing total antioxidant potential (taop) and total peroxide levels (tperox). the ratio of tperox to taop is referred as oxidative stress index (osi).   results we noticed that serum taop level was significantly lower in ds group compared with nds and hc groups. the osi was also found to be higher in ds group compared with nds and hc groups. furthermore, serum taop level and status of osi were similar between nds and hc groups.   conclusion our study is the first to demonstrate differences between ds and nds in terms of status of oxidative stress and serum total antioxidant level. we suggest that our study represents novel and important results in terms of supporting provides and hypothesis which considered ds as a different disease entity with respect to nds. further studies are needed for investigating the status of antioxidants and oxidative stress and their clinical implications in deficit schizophrenia. dysregulation of free radical metabolism as reflected by abnormal erythrocyte activities of three critical enzymes of the antioxidant defense system (aods), i.e. superoxide dismutase (sod), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px) and catalase (cat), has been reported in schizophrenic patients. the present study examined the effects of haloperidol, a standard antipsychotic agent, on the aods enzymes, using a within-subject, repeated-measures, on-off haloperidol treatment design. the mean drug free period was 40 days. at baseline, there were no significant differences for all three enzymes between patients and age and sex-matched normal volunteers. during the drug-free condition, sod activity, but not gsh-px and cat activities, was significantly higher relative to normal control subjects. however, within-subjects both sod and gsh-px activities, but not cat activity, were higher in the drug-free condition compared to the treatment condition. no significant correlation was observed between sod activity and plasma haloperidol (or daily haloperidol dose) levels. smoking status, as assessed by the cotinine level, was unrelated to enzyme activities. in addition, none of the major aods enzymes showed significant differences between relapsed and clinically stable patients. these findings suggest that haloperidol may not have direct regulatory effect on aods enzyme activities and that sod and gsh-px activities may change in response to other factors such as change in symptom severity.
hao jiang,1 abhijit shukla,2 xiaoling wang,1 wei-yi chen,1 bradley e. bernstein,2 and robert g. roeder1,* 1laboratory of biochemistry and molecular biology, the rockefeller university, new york, new york 10065, usa 2howard hughes medical institute and department of pathology, massachusetts general hospital and harvard medical school, boston, massachusetts 02114, usa *correspondence: roeder@mail.rockefeller.edu doi 10.1016/j.cell.2011.01.020 locus control regions (lcrs) are defined by their ability, in transgenic assays, to direct high-level, tissue-specific expression of linked genes at all sites of integration examined and at moderately constant levels per gene copy. the most extensively examined lcr is that associated with the b-globin locus in mammals, where the b-globin genes reside in a linear array and are usually arranged in order of their developmental expression (fig. 1). the b-globin lcr consists of several dnase i hypersensitive sites (hss) spread over a region of 20–30 kb; the dna sequence associated with each of the hss contains numerous binding sites for erythroid-specific and ubiquitous transcription factors (for review, see grosveld et al. 1993; orkin 1995; martin et al. 1996; hardison et al. 1997). expression of stably integrated b-globin transgenes in the absence of the lcr occurs only at low levels and varies depending upon the site of integration, and so is said to be subject to position effects. the high level of expression driven by the lcr at ectopic sites appears to be the product of at least two separable activities, namely the establishment of an ‘open’ chromatin domain and direct gene activation. gene activation is also a property of enhancers, which are defined by their ability to direct high-level expression of linked genes in transient transfection assays. although enhancers typically also improve the expression of transgenes integrated into the genome, such expression varies among integration sites due to negative position effects. thus, unlike lcrs, enhancers are only capable of gene activation at a subset of genomic loci. presumably, lcrs subsume the function of enhancers along with a more dominant chromatin ‘opening’ activity that can override negative effects from neighboring regions. in the case of the b-globin lcr, 58 hs2 is known to act as an enhancer in transient transfection assays, but elements in addition to hs2 are required for lcr activity in single-copy transgenes (ellis et al. 1993, 1996). evidence from one study indicates that an otherwise intact human b-globin locus translocated near centromeric heterochromatin may be subject to a position effect (rees et al. 1994). thus, the distinction between enhancers and lcrs may only be one of degree, but in most transgenic assays is still measurable. given the apparent importance of lcrs in the regulation of many tissue-specific genes, the mechanism by which these elements function has been the subject of a great deal of debate. the currently predominant model for lcr function involves the establishment of an open chromatin domain encompassing the regulated genes, with subsequent gene activation accomplished by direct interactions between elements of the lcr and gene promoters by dna looping. in this review, we will summarize models for the establishment of active chromatin domains by lcrs and describe in detail the evidence for the looping model of long-distance gene activation. recent data, especially relating to the function of boundary elements and evidence for facilitators of enhancer and lcr function, indicate that simple lcr–promoter interactions are unlikely. based on these data, we propose an alternative to the looping model, which we term the linking model.
codons play important roles in regulating gene expression levels and mrna half-lives. however, codon usage and related studies in multicellular organisms still lag far behind those in unicellular organisms. in this study, we describe for the first time genome-wide patterns of codon bias in morus notabilis (mulberry tree), and analyze genome-wide codon usage in 12 other species within the order rosales. the codon usage of m. notabilis was affected by nucleotide composition, mutation pressure, nature selection, and gene expression level. translational selection optimal codons were identified and highly expressed genes of m. notabilis tended to use the optimal codons. genes with higher expression levels have shorter coding region and lower amino acid complexity. housekeeping genes showed stronger translational selection, which, notably, was not caused by the large differences between the expression level of housekeeping genes and other genes. mrna degradation represents a critical regulated step in gene expression. although the major pathways in turnover have been identified, accounting for disparate half-lives has been elusive. we show that codon optimality is one feature that contributes greatly to mrna stability. genome-wide rna decay analysis revealed that stable mrnas are enriched in codons designated optimal, whereas unstable mrnas contain predominately non-optimal codons. substitution of optimal codons with synonymous, non-optimal codons results in dramatic mrna destabilization, whereas the converse substitution significantly increases stability. further, we demonstrate that codon optimality impacts ribosome translocation, connecting the processes of translation elongation and decay through codon optimality. finally, we show that optimal codon content accounts for the similar stabilities observed in mrnas encoding proteins with coordinated physiological function. this work demonstrates that codon optimization exists as a mechanism to finely tune levels of mrnas and, ultimately, proteins.
purposethe folate receptor (fr) has emerged as an interesting diagnostic and therapeutic drug target with many potential applications in oncologic and inflammatory disorders. it was therefore the aim of this study to develop a folate-derived ga-68-based positron emission tomography (pet) imaging tracer that is straightforward to radiolabel and could be broadly used in clinical studies. we validated its target binding affinity and specificity and compared it to [99mtc]ec20, the folate single-photon emission computed tomography (spect) imaging tracer that has been most extensively studied clinically so far.proceduresthe new folic acid-derived pet imaging agent is linked via a polyethyleneglycol linker to the chelator 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-trisacetic acid (nota). this new compound, nota-folate, was labeled with gallium-68. we tested the probe’s stability in human plasma and its selectivity in vitro, using the fr-positive kb cell line as well as the fr-negative a549 cell line. the pharmacokinetic profile of [68ga]nota-folate was evaluated in fr-positive kb mouse xenografts. following intravenous injection of [68ga]nota-folate (383 ± 53 μci), pet/computed tomography (ct) imaging studies as well as biodistribution studies were performed using kb tumor-bearing mice (n = 3). in vitro as well as in vivo studies were performed in parallel with the spect imaging tracer [99mtc]ec20.resultsin comparison to [99mtc]ec20 (radiochemical yield (rcy) = 82.0 ± 2.9 %, 91.8 ± 2.0 % purity), similar radiochemical yield (87.2 ± 6.9 %) and radiochemical purity (95.6 ± 1.8 %) could be achieved for [68ga]nota-folate. for both tracers, we observed high affinity for fr-positive cells in vitro and high plasma stability. in pet/ct and biodistribution studies, [68ga]nota-folate appeared to display slightly superior in vivo performance in comparison to [99mtc]ec20. in detail, 68ga-nota-folate showed very good tumor uptake and retention (6.6 ± 1.1 %id/g), relatively low kidney uptake (21.7 ± 1.1 %id/g), and very low liver uptake (0.38 ± 0.08 %id/g). in vivo blocking studies using a fivefold excess of ec20 reduced the tumor uptake to 2.5 ± 0.7 %id/g, confirming receptor specific binding of [68ga]nota-folate in vivo.conclusionwe validated a new ga-68 folate-based pet imaging agent with excellent pharmacokinetics and tumor uptake. based on a head-to-head comparison between both tracers, [68ga]nota-folate is a suitable imaging probe for the delineation of fr-positive tumors and a promising candidate for clinical translation. in some epithelial cells studied in vitro a membrane-bound folate receptor initiates the process for cell accumulation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid. this receptor was found to be gp38, an overexpressed, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchored glycoprotein, recognized by two monoclonal antibodies, designated mov18 and mov19. using immunoblotting with mov19, radioimmunoassay with mov18 and 19, northern blot analysis, and radioligand binding when possible, we describe the limited expression of the folate receptor in a large number of normal tissues from four autopsies. the immunoblot technique detected as little as 40 pg (approximately 1 fmol) of receptor protein. choroid plexus consistently had the largest amount of folate receptor. other tissues containing substantial amounts of receptor included lung, thyroid, and kidney. the liver, intestines, muscle, cerebellum, cerebrum, and spinal cord were immunologically nonreactive. folate receptor gene expression determined by northern blot analysis confirmed these observations. we also show that several malignant cell lines express significantly more receptor than normal epithelial cells or fibroblasts. specifically, malignant cells bound greater than or equal to 20 pmol [3h]folate/10(6) cells, while normal epithelial cells and fibroblasts bound less than or equal to 1 pmol radioligand/10(6) cells. we also demonstrate that 4 of 6 brain tumors overexpress the folate receptor. these studies reveal the limited normal tissue distribution of the folate receptor, a cell surface protein which may be a useful immunological or pharmacological target for the development of selective cancer therapy.
objectives: to investigate the early influence of periosteum removal on osteocytes in mouse calvaria. material and methods: fifteen c57bl/6 male mice were used in this study. under anesthesia, a 2x3mm rectangular shape periosteum, 2mm behind the coronal suture and 1mm beside the sagittal suture, was surgically removed from the left side of calvaria whereas the right side was intact as control. five mice were sacrificed at 1 day, 3 days and 7 days after the operation and the calvaria together with the surrounding tissues were histologically examined. results: at 3 days and 7 days, the number of empty lacunae significantly increased at the periosteum stripped side compared to the intact control side. the empty lacunae were mainly restricted to the outer half of the calvaria under the periosteum stripped area. sclerostin distribution in lacunae and canaliculi also dramatically decreased at the periosteum stripped side at all the time points. conclusion: periosteum removal would induce early apoptosis of the osteocytes in the outer layer of the bone and decrease sclerostin within this area. correspondence to: songtao wu, department of oral implantology and regenerative dental medicine, graduate school of medical and dental sciences, tokyo medical and dental university, tokyo113-8549, japan, tel: +81 3 5803 4664; e-mail: wstcbh@hotmail.com; songirm@tmd.ac.jp received: september 27, 2015; accepted: october 20, 2015; published: october 26, 2015 introduction periosteum, the stiff envelope bounds the skeleton, plays an essential role in offering protection and nutrition to the cortical bone [1]. furthermore, periosteum also severs as a reservoir of progenitor cells and preserves a remarkable bone regeneration capacity, which is crucial for both prenatal bone development and postnatal fracture healing [2]. for immature skeletal system, periosteum-derived ossification makes long bones grow radially [3] and in fracture healing process, periosteum is also inevitable [4]. the formation of cartilage and bone within the callus owes largely to the mesenchymal progenitor cell from the periosteum [5]. when the periosteum is irritated by trauma, infection, neoplasia, or sometimes surgical procedure, new bone would be rapidly formed, which is favorable or unfavorable [6-9]. a previous study showed that the elevation of periosteum can induce new bone formation underneath [10]. in spite of the importance of periosteum, in some surgical circumstances, it has to be completely removed from the bone surface, such as in proper open reduction and in plate applications for treating bone fractures [11], and surgical removal of soft tissue sarcomas (sts) to ensure the adequate surgical margins [12]. in dental implant surgeries, clinicians often apply tension releasing incisions, cutting the periosteum at the base of the muco-periosteal flap to complete a primary closure, especially in ridge expansion procedures [13]. this incision into the periosteal layer leaves a hole, resulting in direct contact of the mucosa to the cortical bone, which can be considered as another kind of the periosteum stripping. the apoptosis of osteocyte is another highlighted topic, which is already known to be a result of many physiological or pathological changes, such as rapid modeling process [14], age-associated oxidative stress [15], estrogen deficiency [16], overwhelming of glucocorticoid [17]. also from a mechanical view, unloading of bone which weakens the canaliculiar fluid shear stress will result in osteocyte apoptosis [18]. conversely, excessive loading which produces microdamage disrupting the canaliculiar system integrity also leads to osteocyte apoptosis [19]. although the studies concerning periosteum stripping or osteocyte apoptosis have been often reported respectively, the reaction of osteocytes to the periosteum stripping has not been clarified yet. in this study, we histologically examined the effects of periosteum removal on the osteocytes in mouse calvaria. materials and methods animal models fifteen male c57bl/6 mice of 12 weeks old, weighing 25-30g, were used in this study. all the experimental procedures had been approved by the animal experiment committee at tokyo medical and dental university.

procedure general anesthesia was performed by an intraperitoneal injection of a combination of ketamine and xylazine (75 mg and 0.5 mg per kg body weight, respectively). the hair of calvarial zone was shaved and the skin over the skull was cleaned with 70% ethanol. incision of 20mm length was made in the central line of head and partial thickness flap was raised. a 2 x 3mm rectangular (2mm behind the coronal suture and 1mm beside the sagittal suture) area was marked with ink on left side of calvarial periosteum (figure 1a). then, the stripping was performed with scalpel and dental excavator to remove the periosteum completely (figure 1b and 1c). the right side of calvaria was intact as control. finally the surgical area was closed with suturing. five mice were sacrificed for each time point at 1, 3 and 7 days after the operation. following the anesthesia mentioned above, a perfusion fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde was performed to secure the bone tissue. then, the whole calvarial bone together with the skin was harvested and fixed in the 4% paraformaldehyde. procedure for histological analysis after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°c for 2 days and washing in phosphate buffered saline (pbs) at 4°c for 1 days, samples were decalcified in 20% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) at 4°c for 14 days and embedded in paraffin. serial sections of 4 μm thickness were prepared and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (he) staining and immunohistochemical (ihc) staining. images of stained specimens were acquired with an upright microscope (axioskop2, carl zeiss, oberkochen, germany). immunohistochemical (ihc) staining immunohistochemistry analysis of markers for sclerostin was carried out in the paraffin embedded sections. briefly, deparaffinized and hydrated sections were incubated with 0.1% trypsin solution (difcotm trypsin 250, bd biosciences) for 20 minutes in water bath at 37°c. after cooling, the sections were rinsed with tris-buffered solution (50mm tris, 150mm nacl and 0.05% tween20, tbst) and incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 minutes at room temperature to remove the internal peroxidase. after rinsing the sections with tbst, sections were incubated with the primary antibody (goat-anti-mouse sclerostin 1:200, r&d systems, minneapolis, mn) diluted in tbst overnight at 4°c in a humidifying chamber. after washes with tbst, secondary antibody (histofine rr simple staintm mouse max-po(g), nichirei, tokyo, japan) was applied and incubated with the sections for 1 hour at room temperature. sections were developed with 3,3n-diaminobenzidine tertrahydrochloride (dab) for 2.5 minutes and, after washing with tap water, counterstained with 1% methyl green for 20 minutes. slides were mounted using permount mounting media (fisher scientifics). images of stained specimens were acquired in the same way as he staining. histomorphometry analysis for histomorphometric analysis of he stain slides, high resolution digital images (at 10 times magnification) were acquired on the left side of calvaria within bone area 1mm away from the sagittal suture, and the same area of the control side. for the images of both sides, the number of empty lacunae and total lacunae was counted using the enlarged images. in the same area of he stain slide, the images of sclerostin immunohistochemical stain slides were also obtained. statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed with standard student’s t-tests for comparisons between different sides of within the same time point. the one-way analysis of variance (anova) was employed for longitudinal comparisons between different time points of the same side. results histological findings in the he stain slides, the periosteum stripping side showed slightly increased number of empty lacunae than control side at day 1. the number of empty lacunae increased significantly on periosteum stripping side than the control side at day 3 and 7. interestingly, the number of empty lacunae also increased at day 7 in control side (figures 2 and 3). notably, almost all the empty lacunae were found in the outer half of the calvaria, whereas the inner half layer was less affected. immunohistochemical (ihc) stain in all 3 time points, the periosteum removal sides showed less staining for sclerostin whereas the control sides showed more sclerostin distribution among osteocytes. also in control side, a clear network of canaliculi radius, which was positively stained, spread out from the lacunae in the middle or inner layer of the bone could be often observed. however in the periosteum removed side, even in the 1day group, the canaliculi existing sclerostin were seldom observed around the lacunae (figure 4). prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)), a prostanoid synthesized from arachidonic acid via the cyclooxygenase pathway, is a modulator of physiological responses including inflammation, fever, and muscle regeneration. several patents have been filed that are related to pge(2), one of them being directly related to skeletal muscles. in this report, we first summarize the key patents describing inventions for the utilization of pge(2) for either diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, including skeletal muscle. in the second part of our work we present new and exciting data that demonstrates that pge(2) accelerates skeletal muscle myogenic differentiation. our discovery resulted from our recent and novel concept of bone-muscle crosstalk. bone and muscle are anatomically intimate endocrine organs and we aimed to determine whether this anatomical intimacy also translates into a biochemical communication from bone cells to muscle cells at the in vitro level. the effects of mloy4 osteocyte-like cell conditioned medium (cm) and three osteocyte-secreted factors, pge(2), sclerostin and monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp-3), on c2c12 myogenic differentiation were evaluated using morphological analyses, a customized 96-gene pcr array, and measurements of intracellular calcium levels. mlo-y4 cm and pge(2), but not sclerostin and mcp-3, induced acceleration of myogenesis of c2c12 myoblasts that was linked with significant modifications in intracellular calcium homeostasis. this finding should further stimulate the pursuit of new patents to explore the use of pge(2) and the new concept of bone-muscle crosstalk for the development and application of inventions designed to treat muscle diseases characterized by enhanced muscle wasting, such as sarcopenia.
prolactin (prl) plays an important role in modulating the immune response. in b cells, prl enhances antibody production, including antibodies with self-specificity. in this study, our aims were to determine the level of prl receptor expression during bone-marrow b-cell development and to assess whether the presence of high prl serum concentrations influences absolute numbers of developing populations and disease outcome in lupus-prone murine models. we observed that the prl-receptor is expressed in early bone-marrow b-cell; the expression in lupus-prone mice, which had the highest level of expression in pro-b cells and immature cells, differed from that in wild-type mice. these expression levels did not significantly change in response to hyperprolactinemia; however, populations of pro-b and immature cells from lupus-prone strains showed a decrease in the absolute numbers of cells with high prl-receptor expression in response to prl. because immature self-reactive b cells are constantly being eliminated, we assessed the expression of survival factor birc5, which is more highly expressed in both pro-b and immature b-cells in response to prl and correlates with the onset of disease. these results identify an important role of prl in the early stages of the b-cell maturation process: prl may promote the survival of self-reactive clones. the molecular crosstalk between the interleukin 7 receptor (il-7r) and the precursor to the b cell antigen receptor (pre-bcr) in b lymphopoiesis has not been elucidated. here we demonstrate that in pre-b cells, the il-7r but not the pre-bcr was coupled to phosphatidylinositol-3-oh kinase (pi(3)k) and the kinase akt; signaling by this pathway inhibited expression of recombination-activating gene 1 (rag1) and rag2. attenuation of il-7 signaling resulted in upregulation of the transcription factors foxo1 and pax5, which coactivated many pre-b cell genes, including rag1, rag2 and blnk. induction of blnk (which encodes the signaling adaptor blnk) enabled pre-bcr signaling via the signaling molecule syk and promoted immunoglobulin light-chain rearrangement. blnk expression also antagonized akt activation, thereby augmenting the accumulation of foxo1 and pax5. this self-reinforcing molecular circuit seemed to sense limiting concentrations of il-7 and functioned to constrain the proliferation of pre-b cells and trigger their differentiation.
patients taking amitriptyline (amt) have an increased risk of sudden cardiac death, yet the mechanism for amt's proarrhythmic effects remains incompletely understood. here, we hypothesize that amt activates cardiac ryanodine channels (ryr2), causing premature ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr), a mechanism identified by genetic studies as a cause of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. to test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of amt on ryr2 channels from mice and sheep and on intact mouse cardiomyocytes loaded with the ca2+ fluorescent indicator fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester. amt induced trains of long channel openings (bursts) with 60 to 90% of normal conductance in ryr2 channels incorporated in lipid bilayers. the [amt], voltage, and open probability (po) dependencies of burst frequency and duration indicated that amt binds primarily to open ryr2 channels. amt also activated ryr2 channels isolated from transgenic mice lacking cardiac calsequestrin. reducing ryr2 po by increasing cytoplasmic [mg2+] significantly inhibited the amt effect on ryr2 channels. consistent with the single ryr2 channel data, amt increased the rate of spontaneous ca2+ releases and decreased the sr ca2+ content in intact cardiomyocytes. intracellular [amt] were approximately 5-fold higher than extracellular [amt], explaining amt's higher potency in cardiomyocytes at clinically relevant concentrations (0.5-3 μm) compared with its effect in lipid bilayers (5-10 μm). increasing extracellular [mg2+] attenuated the effect of amt in intact myocytes. we conclude that the heretofore unrecognized activation of ryr2 channels and increased sr ca2+ leak may contribute to amt's proarrhythmic and cardiotoxic effects, which may be counteracted by interventions that reduce ryr2 channel open probability. solution properties of a drug and its partitioning into lipid bilayers were studied for drug extraction using several different techniques, such as surface tension, zeta potential, ultra filtration and uv-vis spectroscopy. from the surface tension study it was found that the presence of salt makes the drug molecules more surface-active. zeta potential revealed the adsorption of the drug into the liposome bilayers to be governed mostly by electrostatic forces. the drug retention volume was expressed as a capacity factor, k, and that was normalized with respect to the amount of the immobilized phospholipids. the k-values for the positively charged drug on the liposomes decreased in the presence of phosphate buffer due to the presence of the oppositely charged ions. the above methods can thus be used to understand the mechanism of drug-membrane interaction and quantification of drug absorption into liposomes.
there is a clinical need for noninvasive biomarkers of tumor hypoxia for prognostic and predictive studies, radiotherapy planning, and therapy monitoring. oxygen-enhanced mri (oe-mri) is an emerging imaging technique for quantifying the spatial distribution and extent of tumor oxygen delivery in vivo. in oe-mri, the longitudinal relaxation rate of protons (δr1) changes in proportion to the concentration of molecular oxygen dissolved in plasma or interstitial tissue fluid. therefore, well-oxygenated tissues show positive δr1. we hypothesized that the fraction of tumor tissue refractory to oxygen challenge (lack of positive δr1, termed "oxy-r fraction") would be a robust biomarker of hypoxia in models with varying vascular and hypoxic features. here, we demonstrate that oe-mri signals are accurate, precise, and sensitive to changes in tumor po2 in highly vascular 786-0 renal cancer xenografts. furthermore, we show that oxy-r fraction can quantify the hypoxic fraction in multiple models with differing hypoxic and vascular phenotypes, when used in combination with measurements of tumor perfusion. finally, oxy-r fraction can detect dynamic changes in hypoxia induced by the vasomodulator agent hydralazine. in contrast, more conventional biomarkers of hypoxia (derived from blood oxygenation-level dependent mri and dynamic contrast-enhanced mri) did not relate to tumor hypoxia consistently. our results show that the oxy-r fraction accurately quantifies tumor hypoxia noninvasively and is immediately translatable to the clinic. because of its paramagnetic properties, oxygen may act as an endogenous magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent by changing proton relaxation rates. changes in tissue oxygen concentrations have been shown to produce changes in relaxation rate r1 of water. the aim of the study was to improve the sensitivity of oxygen enhanced r1 imaging by exploiting the higher solubility of oxygen in lipids (as compared with water) to sensitively monitor changes in tissue oxygen levels by selectively measuring the r1 of lipids.
memory deficits in drosophila nalyot mutants suggest that the myb family transcription factor adf-1 is an important regulator of developmental plasticity in the brain. however, the cellular functions for this transcription factor in neurons or molecular mechanisms by which it regulates plasticity remain unknown. here, we use in vivo 3d reconstruction of identifiable larval motor neuron dendrites to show that adf-1 is required cell autonomously for dendritic development and activity-dependent plasticity of motor neurons downstream of camkii. adf-1 inhibition reduces dendrite growth and neuronal excitability, and results in motor deficits and altered transcriptional profiles. surprisingly, analysis by comparative chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (chip-seq) of adf-1, rna polymerase ii (pol ii), and histone modifications in kc cells shows that adf-1 binding correlates positively with high pol ii-pausing indices and negatively with active chromatin marks such as h3k4me3 and h3k27ac. consistently, the expression of adf-1 targets staufen and fasciclin ii (fasii), identified through larval brain chip-seq for adf-1, is negatively regulated by adf-1, and manipulations of these genes predictably modify dendrite growth. our results imply mechanistic interactions between transcriptional and local translational machinery in neurons as well as conserved neuronal growth mechanisms mediated by cell adhesion molecules, and suggest that camkii, adf-1, fasii, and staufen influence crucial aspects of dendrite development and plasticity with potential implications for memory formation. further, our experiments reveal molecular details underlying transcriptional regulation by adf-1, and indicate active interaction between adf-1 and epigenetic regulators of gene expression during activity-dependent neuronal plasticity. drosophila calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii is alternatively spliced to generate multiple isoforms that vary only in a region between the calmodulin-binding domain and the association domain. this variation has been shown to modulate activation of the enzyme by calmodulin. in this study we examine the ability of seven of the drosophila isoforms to phosphorylate purified protein substrates and to be inhibited by a substrate analog, and the response of six of the isoforms to a mutant form of calmodulin (v91g) that was isolated in a genetic screen. significant variation in kms for eag, a potassium channel, and adf-1, a transcription factor, were found. in the case of the a peptide inhibitor, ac3i, there were significant variations in ki between isoforms. kact for v91g calmodulin was increased for all of the isoforms. in addition, one isoform, ri, exhibited a lower vmax when assayed with this mutant cam. these results indicate that the variable domain of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii is capable of altering the substrate specificity of the catalytic domain and the activation response to calmodulin.
primary hyperparathyroidism (phpt) is caused by excessive autonomous secretion of parathormone (pth), usually as a result of a parathyroid adenoma (80-85%), and less frequently due to parathyroid gland hyperplasia (15%-20%) or carcinoma (1%) (kaplan et al.1991). patients often suffer from mild subjective symptoms such as weakness and tiredness, but if untreated, symptoms progess to include dementia, depression, peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, constipation, renal calculi, and diffuse bone and joint pain (clark 2003). aim: to evaluate the role of usg in the preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas in patients with symptomatic hyperparathyroidism and to compare its usefulness with that of scintigraphy scan and postoperative findings. material and methods: twenty-five patients with symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism were subjected to usg of the neck and nuclear scintigraphy, followed by surgery. the results were independently analyzed and compared with per-operative findings. results: the 25 patients had a total of 28 abnormal glands: 22 solitary adenomas, and 6 multiple adenomas (two each in three patients). usg detected 20 out of 22 solitary adenomas and three out of six multiple adenomas. usg missed five abnormal glands, two of which were in the neck and three in the mediastinum. scintigraphy was positive in 26 abnormal glands, out of which 22 were single and four were multiple. two abnormal glands were missed: one in the neck and one in the mediastinum. conclusion: as limited neck dissection for primary hyperparathyroidism becomes increasingly popular, usg has been found to be a sensitive, specific, and easily available noninvasive investigation for parathyroid localization. it can be easily offered to patients as a method for preoperative localization prior to limited parathyroid surgery outside tertiary care settings.
spatial memory of cached food items plays an important role in cache recovery by scatter-hoarding animals. however, whether scatter-hoarding animals intentionally select cache sites with respect to visual landmarks in the environment and then rely on them to recover their cached seeds for later use has not been extensively explored. furthermore, there is a lack of evidence on whether there are sex differences in visual landmark-based food-hoarding behaviors in small rodents even though male and female animals exhibit different spatial abilities. in the present study, we used a scatter-hoarding animal, the siberian chipmunk, tamias sibiricus to explore these questions in semi-natural enclosures. our results showed that t. sibiricus preferred to establish caches in the shallow pits labeled with visual landmarks (branches of pinus sylvestris, leaves of athyrium brevifrons and pvc tubes). in addition, visual landmarks of p. sylvestris facilitated cache recovery by t. sibiricus. we also found significant sex differences in visual landmark-based food-hoarding strategies in siberian chipmunks. males, rather than females, chipmunks tended to establish their caches with respect to the visual landmarks. our studies show that t. sibiricus rely on visual landmarks to establish and recover their caches, and that sex differences exist in visual landmark-based food hoarding in siberian chipmunks. it is well established that the hippocampal formation is critically involved in the acquisition of trace memories, a paradigm in which the conditioned (cs) and unconditioned stimuli (us) are separated by a temporal gap (solomon et al., 1986). the structure is reportedly not critical for the acquisition of delay memories, where the cs and the us overlap in time (berger & orr, 1983; schmaltz & theios, 1972). based on these results, it is often stated that the hippocampus is involved in "filling the gap" or otherwise associating the two stimuli in time. however, in addition to the presence of a temporal gap, there are other differences between trace and delay conditioning. the most apparent difference is that animals require many more trials to learn the trace task, and thus it is inherently more difficult than the delay task. here, we tested whether the hippocampus was critically involved in delay conditioning, if it was rendered more difficult such that the rate of acquisition was shifted to be analogous to trace conditioning. groups of rats received excitotoxic lesions to the hippocampus, sham lesions or were left intact. using the same interstimulus intervals (isi), control animals required more trials to acquire the trace than the delay task. as predicted, animals with hippocampal lesions were impaired during trace conditioning but not delay conditioning. however, when the delay task was rendered more difficult by extending the isi (a long delay task), animals with hippocampal lesions were impaired. in addition, once the lesioned animal learned the association between the cs and the us during delay conditioning, it could learn and perform the trace cr. thus, the role of the hippocampus in classical conditioning is not limited to learning about discontiguous events in time and space; rather the structure can become engaged simply as a function of task difficulty.
aging is the major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer's disease, but little is known about the processes that lead to age-related decline of brain structures and function. here we use rna-seq in combination with high resolution histological analyses to show that aging leads to a significant deterioration of neurovascular structures including basement membrane reduction, pericyte loss, and astrocyte dysfunction. neurovascular decline was sufficient to cause vascular leakage and correlated strongly with an increase in neuroinflammation including up-regulation of complement component c1qa in microglia/monocytes. importantly, long-term aerobic exercise from midlife to old age prevented this age-related neurovascular decline, reduced c1qa+ microglia/monocytes, and increased synaptic plasticity and overall behavioral capabilities of aged mice. concomitant with age-related neurovascular decline and complement activation, astrocytic apoe dramatically decreased in aged mice, a decrease that was prevented by exercise. given the role of apoe in maintaining the neurovascular unit and as an anti-inflammatory molecule, this suggests a possible link between astrocytic apoe, age-related neurovascular dysfunction and microglia/monocyte activation. to test this, apoe-deficient mice were exercised from midlife to old age and in contrast to wild-type (apoe-sufficient) mice, exercise had little to no effect on age-related neurovascular decline or microglia/monocyte activation in the absence of apoe. collectively, our data shows that neurovascular structures decline with age, a process that we propose to be intimately linked to complement activation in microglia/monocytes. exercise prevents these changes, but not in the absence of apoe, opening up new avenues for understanding the complex interactions between neurovascular and neuroinflammatory responses in aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer’s disease. the decline of cognitive function has emerged as one of the greatest health threats of old age. age-related cognitive decline is caused by an impacted neuronal circuitry, yet the molecular mechanisms responsible are unknown. c1q, the initiating protein of the classical complement cascade and powerful effector of the peripheral immune response, mediates synapse elimination in the developing cns. here we show that c1q protein levels dramatically increase in the normal aging mouse and human brain, by as much as 300-fold. this increase was predominantly localized in close proximity to synapses and occurred earliest and most dramatically in certain regions of the brain, including some but not all regions known to be selectively vulnerable in neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., the hippocampus, substantia nigra, and piriform cortex. c1q-deficient mice exhibited enhanced synaptic plasticity in the adult and reorganization of the circuitry in the aging hippocampal dentate gyrus. moreover, aged c1q-deficient mice exhibited significantly less cognitive and memory decline in certain hippocampus-dependent behavior tests compared with their wild-type littermates. unlike in the developing cns, the complement cascade effector c3 was only present at very low levels in the adult and aging brain. in addition, the aging-dependent effect of c1q on the hippocampal circuitry was independent of c3 and unaccompanied by detectable synapse loss, providing evidence for a novel, complement- and synapse elimination-independent role for c1q in cns aging.
unlabelled research has robustly shown that early negative parenting experiences are associated with psychopathology and self-criticism in adulthood. this study investigates recall of personal feelings of perceived threat and subordination in childhood and its relation to psychopathology. in addition, we explore the mediator role of self-criticism in this association. a sample of 193 subjects from the general population completed self-report questionnaires measuring the study variables. the mediator analyses suggested that the impact of submissiveness experiences in childhood on depression and anxiety is mediated by self-criticism. our findings highlight the route through which the recall of personal feelings of perceived involuntary subordination to parents contributes to depression and anxiety in adulthood.   key practitioner message although the relation between early experiences of abuse and later psychological problems is now well established, there has been less study on subtler forms of threat and subordinate behaviour in childhood. given ours and previous findings, therapists should be aware of, and prone to explore, these early experiences. most studies exploring early negative experiences mainly refer to attachment theory-related constructs (e.g., attachment style). we also highlight the importance of noting rank structure and rank style in the family. self-criticism seems to be a key process in the relation between early aversive experiences of subordination and psychopathology. given the idea that self-reassuring operates through a different affect system, helping people develop inner warmth and compassion for the self may be important to counteract feelings of self-hatred and self-attack. three potential sources of error in retrospective reports of childhood experiences are documented: low reliability and validity of autobiographical memory in general, the presence of general memory impairment associated with psychopathology, and the presence of specific mood-congruent memory biases associated with psychopathology. the evidence reviewed suggests that claims concerning the general unreliability of retrospective reports are exaggerated and that there is little reason to link psychiatric status with less reliable or less valid recall of early experiences. nevertheless, it is clear that steps must be taken to overcome the limitations of retrospective reports and enhance their reliability.
backgroundsugarcane smut caused by sporisorium scitamineum is one of the most severe fungal diseases in the sugarcane industry. using a molecular biological technique to mine sugarcane resistance genes can provide gene resources for further genetic engineering of sugarcane disease-resistant breeding. jasmonate zim (zinc-finger inflorescence meristem) domain (jaz) proteins, which involved in the responses to plant pathogens and abiotic stresses, are important signaling molecules of the jasmonic acid (ja) pathway.resultsseven differentially expressed sugarcane jaz genes, scjaz1–scjaz7, were mined from the transcriptome of sugarcane after inoculation with s. scitamineum. bioinformatic analyses revealed that these seven scjaz genes encoded basic proteins that contain the tify and cct_2 domains. quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) analysis demonstrated that the scjaz1–scjaz7 genes were tissue specific and differentially expressed under adverse stress. during s. scitamineum infection, the transcripts of scjaz4 and scjaz5 were both upregulated in the susceptible genotype roc22 and the resistant genotype yacheng05–179; scjaz1, scjaz2, scjaz3, and scjaz7 were downregulated in yacheng05–179 and upregulated in roc22; and the expression of scjaz6 did not change in roc22, but was upregulated in yacheng05–179. the transcripts of the seven scjaz genes were increased by the stimuli of salicylic acid and abscisic acid, particularly methyl jasmonate. the expression of the genes scjaz1–scjaz7 was immediately upregulated by the stressors hydrogen peroxide, sodium chloride, and copper chloride, whereas slightly induced after treatment with calcium chloride and polyethylene glycol. in addition, the expression of scjaz6, as well as seven tobacco immunity-associated marker genes were upregulated, and antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas solanacearum and fusarium solani var. coeruleum was observed during the transient overexpression of scjaz6 in nicotiana benthamiana, suggesting that the scjaz6 gene is associated with plant immunity.conclusionsthe different expression profiles of the scjaz1–scjaz7 genes during s. scitamineum infection, the positive response of scjaz1–scjaz7 to hormones and abiotic treatments, and the function analysis of the scjaz6 gene revealed their involvement in the defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. the findings of the present study facilitate further research on the scjaz gene family especially their regulatory mechanism in sugarcane. the phytohormone jasmonate (ja) regulates a wide range of growth, developmental, and defense-related processes during the plant life cycle. identification of the jaz family of proteins that repress ja responses has facilitated rapid progress in understanding how this lipid-derived hormone controls gene expression. recent analysis of jaz proteins has provided insight into the nature of the ja receptor, the chemical specificity of signal perception, and cross-talk between ja and other hormone response pathways. functional diversification of jaz proteins by alternative splicing, together with the ability of jaz proteins to homo- and heterodimerize, provide mechanisms to enhance combinatorial diversity and versatility in gene regulation by ja.
inflammatory m1 spectrum macrophages protect from infection but can cause inflammatory disease and tissue damage, whereas alternatively activated/m2 spectrum macrophages reduce inflammation and promote tissue repair. modulation of macrophage phenotype may be therapeutically beneficial and requires further understanding of the molecular programs that control macrophage differentiation. a potential mechanism by which macrophages differentiate may be through microrna (mirna), which bind to messenger rna and post-transcriptionally modify gene expression, cell phenotype and function. we hypothesized that the inflammation-associated mirna, mir-155, would be required for typical development of macrophage inflammatory state. mir-155 was rapidly up-regulated over 100-fold in inflammatory m1(lps + ifn-γ), but not m2(il-4), macrophages. inflammatory genes inos, il1b and tnfa and their corresponding protein or enzymatic products were reduced up to 72% in mir-155 knockout mouse m1(lps + ifn-γ) macrophages, but mir-155 deficiency did not affect expression of the m2-associated gene arg1 in m2(il-4) macrophages. additionally, a mir-155 oligonucleotide inhibitor efficiently suppressed inos and tnfa gene expression in wild-type m1(lps + ifn-γ) macrophages. comparative transcriptional profiling of unstimulated and m1(lps + ifn-γ) macrophages derived from wild-type (wt) and mir-155 knockout (ko) mice revealed that half (approximately 650 genes) of the signature we previously identified in wt m1(lps + ifn-γ) macrophages was dependent on mir-155. real-time pcr of independent datasets confirmed that mir-155 contributed to suppression of its validated mrna targets inpp5d, tspan14, ptprj and mafb and induction of inos, il1b, tnfa, il6 and il12. overall, these data indicate that mir-155 plays an essential role in driving the inflammatory phenotype of m1(lps+ ifn-γ) macrophages. activated macrophages are described as classically activated or m1 type and alternatively activated or m2 type, depending on their response to proinflammatory stimuli and the expression of genetic markers including inos, arginase1, ym1, and fizz1. here we report that akt kinases differentially contribute to macrophage polarization, with akt1 ablation giving rise to an m1 and akt2 ablation resulting in an m2 phenotype. accordingly, akt2−/− mice were more resistant to lps-induced endotoxin shock and to dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis than wild-type mice, whereas akt1−/− mice were more sensitive. cell depletion and reconstitution experiments in a dss-induced colitis model confirmed that the effect was macrophage-dependent. gene-silencing studies showed that the m2 phenotype of akt2−/− macrophages was cell autonomous. the microrna mir-155, whose expression was repressed in naive and in lps-stimulated akt2−/− macrophages, and its target c/ebpβ appear to play a key role in this process. c/ebpβ, a hallmark of m2 macrophages that regulates arg1, was up-regulated upon akt2 ablation or silencing. overexpression or silencing of mir-155 confirmed its central role in akt isoform-dependent m1/m2 polarization of macrophages.
hormones play an important role in regulating the growth of rice tiller buds. however, little is known about the hormonal changes that occur during tiller bud growth and the mechanism of hormonal regulation of tiller bud growth. here, two rice cultivars, yangdao 6 (indica) and nanjing 44 (japonica), were used to investigate the changes in plant hormones during tiller bud growth and the mechanism that underlies the hormonal regulation of tiller bud growth. in the present study, panicles were removed after heading to stimulate the growth of dormant tiller buds located at the elongated upper internodes. at the same time, external abscisic acid (aba), gibberellic acid (ga3) and α-naphthalene acetic acid (naa) were applied. the results demonstrated that auxin and cytokinin (ctk) play important and different roles in the regulation of tiller bud growth. auxin in the nodes inhibits tiller bud growth, while ctk is transferred to the tiller buds to promote growth. the inhibitory effects of ga3 and naa on tiller bud growth are mainly due to the control of the indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) or ctk contents in plants. as opposed to auxin and ctk, the aba contents in nodes and tiller buds remained unchanged before tiller bud growth after panicle removal. meanwhile, external aba application only slightly slowed the growth of the tiller buds, suggesting that aba may not be a key regulator of tiller bud growth. these results indicate that auxin, ctk and aba together likely play roles in the regulation of tiller bud growth. the iaal gene of pseudomonas syringae, subspecies savastanoi, encodes an indoleacetic acid (iaa)-lysine synthetase. to determine the effects of converting iaa to iaa-lysine in whole plants, the iaal gene was fused to a constitutive plant promoter and introduced into tobacco plants. biochemical analyses show that endogenous iaa is reduced by up to 19-fold in iaal plants. tobacco plants expressing the iaal gene display reduced apical dominance, reduced rooting, and inhibition of vascular differentiation. the phenotypic effects of iaal gene expression are reverted by crossing iaal plants with plants that overproduce iaa. these data indicate that iaal can act as an anti-auxin gene in vivo and confirm the role of auxin in the control of apical dominance, root growth, and vascular differentiation in whole plants.
thalamic deep brain stimulation is a mainstay treatment for severe and drug-refractory essential tremor, but postoperative management may be complicated in some patients by a progressive cerebellar syndrome including gait ataxia, dysmetria, worsening of intention tremor and dysarthria. typically, this syndrome manifests several months after an initially effective therapy and necessitates frequent adjustments in stimulation parameters. there is an ongoing debate as to whether progressive ataxia reflects a delayed therapeutic failure due to disease progression or an adverse effect related to repeated increases of stimulation intensity. in this study we used a multimodal approach comparing clinical stimulation responses, modelling of volume of tissue activated and metabolic brain maps in essential tremor patients with and without progressive ataxia to disentangle a disease-related from a stimulation-induced aetiology. ten subjects with stable and effective bilateral thalamic stimulation were stratified according to the presence (five subjects) of severe chronic-progressive gait ataxia. we quantified stimulated brain areas and identified the stimulation-induced brain metabolic changes by multiple 18 f-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography performed with and without active neurostimulation. three days after deactivating thalamic stimulation and following an initial rebound of symptom severity, gait ataxia had dramatically improved in all affected patients, while tremor had worsened to the presurgical severity, thus indicating a stimulation rather than disease-related phenomenon. models of the volume of tissue activated revealed a more ventrocaudal stimulation in the (sub)thalamic area of patients with progressive gait ataxia. metabolic maps of both patient groups differed by an increased glucose uptake in the cerebellar nodule of patients with gait ataxia. our data suggest that chronic progressive gait ataxia in essential tremor is a reversible cerebellar syndrome caused by a maladaptive response to neurostimulation of the (sub)thalamic area. the metabolic signature of progressive gait ataxia is an activation of the cerebellar nodule, which may be caused by inadvertent current spread and antidromic stimulation of a cerebellar outflow pathway originating in the vermis. an anatomical candidate could be the ascending limb of the uncinate tract in the subthalamic area. adjustments in programming and precise placement of the electrode may prevent this adverse effect and help fine-tuning deep brain stimulation to ameliorate tremor without negative cerebellar signs. in this chapter brain imaging tools in neurosciences are presented. these include a brief overview on single-photon emission tomography (spet) and a detailed focus on positron emission tomography (pet) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri). in addition, a critical discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of the three diagnostic systems is added. furthermore, this article describes the image analysis tools from visual analysis over region-of-interest technique up to statistical parametric mapping, co-registration methods, and network analysis. it also compares the newly developed combined pet/ct scanner approach with established image fusion software approaches. there is rapid change: better scanner qualities, new software packages and scanner concepts are on the road paved for an amply bright future in neurosciences.
the hypothalamus is of enormous importance for multiple bodily functions such as energy homeostasis. especially, rodent studies have greatly contributed to our understanding how specific hypothalamic subregions integrate peripheral and central signals into the brain to control food intake. in humans, however, the neural circuitry of the hypothalamus, with its different subregions, has not been delineated. hence, the aim of this study was to map the hypothalamus network using resting‐state functional connectivity (fc) analyses from the medial hypothalamus (mh) and lateral hypothalamus (lh) in healthy normal‐weight adults (n = 49). furthermore, in a separate sample, we examined differences within the lh and mh networks between healthy normal‐weight (n = 25) versus overweight/obese adults (n = 23). fc patterns from the lh and mh revealed significant connections to the striatum, thalamus, brainstem, orbitofrontal cortex, middle and posterior cingulum and temporal brain regions. however, our analysis revealed subtler distinctions within hypothalamic subregions. the lh was functionally stronger connected to the dorsal striatum, anterior cingulum, and frontal operculum, while the mh showed stronger functional connections to the nucleus accumbens and medial orbitofrontal cortex. furthermore, overweight/obese participants revealed heightened fc in the orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens within the mh network. our results indicate that the mh and lh network are tapped into different parts of the dopaminergic circuitry of the brain, potentially modulating food reward based on the functional connections to the ventral and dorsal striatum, respectively. in obese adults, fc changes were observed in the mh network. hum brain mapp 35:6088–6096, 2014. © 2014 wiley periodicals, inc. the hypothalamus integrates various hormonal and neuronal signals to regulate appetite and metabolism and thereby serves a homeostatic purpose in the regulation of body weight. additional neural circuits that are superimposed on this system have the potential to override the homeostatic signals, resulting in either gluttony or anorexia at the extremes. midbrain dopamine neurons have long been implicated in mediating reward behavior and the motivational aspects of feeding behavior. recent results reveal that hormones implicated in regulating the homeostatic system also impinge directly on dopamine neurons; for example, leptin and insulin directly inhibit dopamine neurons, whereas ghrelin activates them. here, i discuss the predictions and implications of these new findings as they relate to dopamine signaling and the physiology of appetite control.
dep domain–containing mtor‐interacting protein (deptor) has been recently discovered as an endogenous regulator of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1) and mtorc2. mtorc1 is present in the brain, and there is growing evidence that its dysregulation contributes to several brain alterations. this suggests the involvement of mtor signaling and its modulators in neurobiological controls. here, we characterized and mapped the expression of deptor in the rat brain. we show that deptor was widely expressed from the forebrain to the hindbrain, including the hippocampus, the mediobasal hypothalamus, and the circumventricular organs (cvos). in the hippocampus, deptor protein and deptor mrna were highly expressed in the dendate gyrus and ca3 field. in the cvos, deptor was expressed in the subfornical organ, the median eminence, and the area postrema. in the mediobasal hypothalamus, deptor was expressed in neurons of the ventromedial nucleus (vmh) and colocalized with proopiomelanocortin (pomc) in the arcuate nucleus (arc). the hypothalamic distribution suggested a role for deptor in energy balance. supporting this possibility, we observed that deptor hypothalamic expression was modulated by the nutritional status in a context of diet‐induced and genetic obesity; food deprivation increased deptor mrna in both the arc and vmh of obese rats. in conclusion, the present results illustrate the presence of deptor in the rat brain and suggest a role for deptor in the hypothalamic regulation of energy balance, which further supports the role of mtor in energy homeostasis. j. comp. neurol. 523:93–107, 2015. © 2014 wiley periodicals, inc. the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mtor) signaling pathway senses and integrates a variety of environmental cues to regulate organismal growth and homeostasis. the pathway regulates many major cellular processes and is implicated in an increasing number of pathological conditions, including cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and neurodegeneration. here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the mtor pathway and its role in health, disease, and aging. we further discuss pharmacological approaches to treat human pathologies linked to mtor deregulation.
expression of the bcr-abl fusion gene in hematopoietic progenitor cells (hpcs) results in the development of chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml), for which hematopoietic microenvironment plays an important role. we investigated the specific effects of an hpc line transduced with bcr-abl, koba, on bm-derived op9 stroma cells. dna microarray analysis revealed that op9 cells co-cultured with koba cells (op9/l) show diverse changes in the gene expression. op9/l cells showed significant down-regulation of cdkn genes and up-regulation of icam1, leading to the increased proliferation capacity of op9 cells and enhanced transmigration of leukemia cells through them. the effects were attributed to direct notch activation of op9 cells by koba cells. op9/l cells also showed a markedly altered cytokine gene expression pattern, including a robust increase in a variety of proinflammatory genes and a decrease in hematopoietic cytokines such as cxcl12, scf, and angpt1. consequently, op9/l cells promoted the proliferation of koba cells more efficiently than parental op9 cells, whereas the activity supporting normal myelopoiesis was attenuated. in mice bearing koba leukemia, the characteristic genetic changes observed in op9/l cells were reflected differentially in the endothelial cells (ecs) and mesenchymal stroma cells (mcs) of the bm. the ecs were markedly increased with notch-target gene activation and decreased cdkn expression, whereas the mcs showed a marked increase in proinflammatory gene expression and a profound decrease in hematopoietic genes. human cml cell lines also induced essentially similar genetic changes in op9 cells. our results suggest that cml cells remodel the hematopoietic microenvironment by changing the gene expression patterns differentially in ecs and mcs of bm. in this study, we isolated cd31(-), cd34(-), cd106(-) (vcam-1(-)), and fetal liver kinase(+) (flk1(+)) cells from adipose tissue. these cells can be induced to differentiate into cells of osteogenic and adipogenic lineages in vitro and were termed adipose derived adult stem cells (adas cells). we also showed that they have characteristics of endothelial progenitor cells. in vitro, adas cells expressed endothelial markers when cultured with vegf. in vivo, adas cells can differentiate in response to local cues into endothelial cells that contributed to neoangiogenesis in hindlimb ischemia models. pi3 kinase inhibitor ly294002 blocked the differentiation of adas cells into endothelial cells in vitro. because adas cells can be expanded in culture without obvious senescence for more than 20 population doublings, they may be a potential source of endothelial cells for cellular pro-angiogenic therapies.
large-scale expansions of dna repeats are implicated in numerous hereditary disorders in humans. we describe a yeast experimental system to analyze large-scale expansions of triplet gaa repeats responsible for the human disease friedreich's ataxia. when gaa repeats were placed into an intron of the chimeric ura3 gene, their expansions caused gene inactivation, which was detected on the selective media. we found that the rates of expansions of gaa repeats increased exponentially with their lengths. these rates were only mildly dependent on the repeat's orientation within the replicon, whereas the repeat-mediated replication fork stalling was exquisitely orientation dependent. expansion rates were significantly elevated upon inactivation of the replication fork stabilizers, tof1 and csm3, but decreased in the knockouts of postreplication dna repair proteins, rad6 and rad5, and the dna helicase sgs1. we propose a model for large-scale repeat expansions based on template switching during replication fork progression through repetitive dna. recombination induced by double‐strand breaks (dsbs) in yeast leads to a higher proportion of expansions to contractions than does replication‐associated tract length changes. expansions are apparently dependent on the property of the repeat array to form hairpins, since dsb repair of a caa87 repeat induces only contractions of the repeat sequence. dsb‐repair efficiency is reduced by 40% when dna synthesis must traverse a cag98 array, as compared with a caa87 array. these data indicate that repair‐ associated dna synthesis is inhibited by secondary structures formed by cag98 and that these structures promote repeat expansions during dsb repair. overexpression of mre11p or rad50p suppresses the inhibition of dsb repair by cag98 and significantly increases the average size of expansions found at the recipient locus. both effects are dependent on the integrity of the mre11p–rad50p–xrs2p complex. the mre11 complex thus appears to be directly involved in removing cag or ctg hairpins that arise frequently during dna synthesis accompanying gene conversion of these trinucleotide repeats.
at the outset, i believe that the concept of ionizing-radiation (ir) resistance needs to be clarified in a tangible manner for readers of this chapter. i propose the following general definition adopted in a previous paper (sghaier et al., 2008): an ionizing-radiation-resistant prokaryotes (irrp) is any vegetative prokaryote that can thrive after exposure to high, acute ir (generally, with a d10 value the dose necessary to effect a 90% reduction in colony forming units greater than 1 kgy) using efficient physiological, genetic and proteic protection and repair mechanisms to fully amend its dna dsbs. ir resistance has been observed in a broad range of prokaryotic groups (kopylov et al., 1993), including hyperthermophilic archaea (p. abyssi, p. furiosus, thermococcus marinus, thermococcus radiotolerans and thermococcus gammatolerans) (diruggiero et al., 1997; jolivet et al., 2003a; jolivet et al., 2003b; jolivet et al., 2004), halophilic archaea (halobacterium sp.) (kottemann et al., 2005), the deinococcus-thermus group (many deinococcus sp. and truepera radiovictrix) (albuquerque et al., 2005), actinobacteria (rubrobacter radiotolerans, rubrobacter xylanophilus and kineococcus radiotolerans) (yoshinaka et al., 1973; ferreira et al., 1999; phillips et al., 2002; chen et al., 2004), proteobacteria (methylobacterium radiotolerans and acinetobacter radioresistens) (ito and iizuka, 1971; nishimura et al., 1994), cyanobacteria (chroococcidiopsis sp.) (billi et al., 2000), and sphingobacteria (hymenobacter actinosclerus) (collins et al., 2000). however, with the exception of deinococcus and pyrococcus, very little information is available regarding the mechanisms of ir resistance and comparative genomics in the above-mentioned prokaryotes. d. radiodurans is the current gold-medallist of ir resistance among prokaryotes with a completely sequenced genome (liolios et al., 2006; liolios et al., 2010), and can amend more than 100 dsbs per chromosome, induced by ir, without loss of viability (moseley, 1983; white et al., 1999). after breaking of its 3.2 mb genome into 20−30 kb pieces by a high dose of ir, d. radiodurans fascinatingly reassembles its genome such that 3 hr later fully restructured nonrearranged chromosomes are present (galhardo and rosenberg, 2009). nine interrelated explanations for the extreme ir resistance of d. radiodurans have been proposed: (i) the binding of irri (dr0171) to genomic repeat sequences that might prevent exhaustive chromosomal degradation after ir exposure irr for ir resistance (udupa et al., 1994), (ii) the dehydration or desiccation is one of the most frequent and severe challenges to living cells. the bacterium deinococcus radiodurans is the best known extremophile among the few organisms that can survive extremely high exposures to desiccation and ionizing radiation, which shatter its genome into hundreds of short dna fragments. remarkably, these fragments are readily reassembled into a functional 3.28-megabase genome. here we describe the relevant two-stage dna repair process, which involves a previously unknown molecular mechanism for fragment reassembly called ‘extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing’ (esdsa), followed and completed by crossovers. at least two genome copies and random dna breakage are requirements for effective esdsa. in esdsa, chromosomal fragments with overlapping homologies are used both as primers and as templates for massive synthesis of complementary single strands, as occurs in a single-round multiplex polymerase chain reaction. this synthesis depends on dna polymerase i and incorporates more nucleotides than does normal replication in intact cells. newly synthesized complementary single-stranded extensions become ‘sticky ends’ that anneal with high precision, joining together contiguous dna fragments into long, linear, double-stranded intermediates. these intermediates require reca-dependent crossovers to mature into circular chromosomes that comprise double-stranded patchworks of numerous dna blocks synthesized before radiation, connected by dna blocks synthesized after radiation.
jukka lankinen local features in image and video processing object class matching and video shot detection lappeenranta, 2014 97 p. acta universitatis lappeenrantaensis (576) diss. lappeenranta university of technology isbn 978-952-265-592-9 isbn 978-952-265-593-6 (pdf) issn-l 1456-4491 issn 1456-4491 the usage of digital content, such as video clips and images, has increased dramatically during the last decade. local image features have been applied increasingly in various image and video retrieval applications. this thesis evaluates local features and applies them to image and video processing tasks. the results of the study show that 1) the performance of di erent local feature detector and descriptor methods vary signi cantly in object class matching, 2) local features can be applied in image alignment with superior results against the state-of-the-art, 3) the local feature based shot boundary detection method produces promising results, and 4) the local feature based hierarchical video summarization method shows promising new new research direction. in conclusion, this thesis presents the local features as a powerful tool in many applications and the imminent future work should concentrate on improving the quality of the local features. we present a new unsupervised method to learn unified probabilistic object models (poms) which can be applied to classification, segmentation, and recognition. we formulate this as a structure learning task and our strategy is to learn and combine basic pom's that make use of complementary image cues. each pom has algorithms for inference and parameter learning, but: (i) the structure of each pom is unknown, and (ii) the inference and parameter learning algorithm for a pom may be impractical without additional information. we address these problems by a novel structure induction procedure which uses knowledge propagation to enable pom's to provide information to other pom's and "teach them" (which greatly reduced the amount of supervision required for training). in particular, we learn a pom-ip defined on interest points using weak supervision [1, 2] and use this to train a pom- mask, defined on regional features, which yields a combined pom which performs segmentation/localization. this combined model can be used to train pom-edgelets, defined on edgelets, which gives a full pom with improved performance on classification. we give detailed experimental analysis on large datasets which show that the full pom is invariant to scale and rotation of the object (for learning and inference) and performs inference rapidly. in addition, we show that we can apply pom's to learn objects classes (i.e. when there are several objects and the identity of the object in each image is unknown). we emphasize that these models can match between different objects from the same category and hence enable object recognition.
pharmacological studies were undertaken with a new series of cholecystokinin2 cck2 agonists in order to assign to them a cck2a or cck2b pharmacological profile. the open-field test was chosen as the discrimination test of cck2b agonists. the most interesting agonist, bbl454 (0.03–300 μg/kg) induced hyperactivity which was blocked by a cck2 antagonist, the d1 antagonist sch23390, the δ-opioid antagonist naltrindole, but not a cck1 antagonist. all compounds active in the open-field test are characterised by a common structural feature, –coch2co–trp-nmenle-asp-phe-nh2, whereas inactive compounds do not possess such a motive. therefore, this feature can be considered crucial for cck2b activity. bbl454 (0.03–3 μg/kg) improved memory in a two-trial memory test while it was very weakly active on the peripheral cck2 receptor, and did not evoke anxiogenic effects in the plus-maze test. the synthesis of bbl454 is simple, its minimal active dose is 30 ng/kg and no “bell-shaped” responses were observed. these results suggest that bbl454 could be considered to be the new cck2b reference agonist. although it is known that panic attacks are triggered by the cholecystokinin fragment cck4, the specific involvement of peripheral or central cholecystokinin cck receptors in various adaptive processes such as emotion, memory and anxiety has yet to be demonstrated. with this aim, we have investigated the biochemical and pharmacological effects resulting from the administration of bc264, a highly potent and selective cck‐b agonist able to cross the blood‐brain barrier. very low doses of bc264 (μg/kg i.p.), increased the exploration of animals submitted to an unknown territory but were devoid of anxiogenic properties in the elevated plus maze. bc264 increased locomotion and rearings of rats newly placed in an open field and improved their spontaneous alternation in a y‐maze. the use of vagotomized animals showed that the increased alternation induced by bc264 did not require an intact vagus nerve, unlike the locomotor activation. these behavioural effects, prevented by the prior i.p. administration of the cck‐b antagonist l‐365,260 but not by the cck‐a antagonist l‐364,718, were shown to depend on dopaminergic systems, since they were blocked by d1 (sch23390, 25 μg/kg i.p.) or d2 (sulpiride, 50 or 100 mg/kg i.p.) antagonists. in addition, bilateral perfusion in freely moving rats of bc264 at pharmacologically active doses, using a newly designed microdialysis system, was found to increase the extracellular levels of da, dopac and hva in the anterior part of the nucleus accumbens. these results show that activation of cck‐b receptors by bc264 does not produce anxiogenic‐like effects but appears to improve motivation and attention, whereas other cck‐b agonists such as boccck4 induce anxiogenic responses. several explanations, including the existence of different sub‐sites of the cck‐b receptor, could account for these differential effects.
voltage-dependent anion channels (vdacs) are reported to be porin-type, β-barrel diffusion pores. they are prominently localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane and are involved in metabolite exchange between the organelle and the cytosol. in this study, we have investigated a family of vdac isoforms in arabidopsis thaliana (atvdac). we have shown that the heterologous expression of atvdac proteins can functionally complement a yeast mutant lacking the endogenous mitochondrial vdac gene. atvdacs tagged with gfp were localized to mitochondria in both yeast and plant cells. we also looked at the response of atvdacs to biotic and abiotic stresses and found that four atvdac transcripts were rapidly up-regulated in response to a bacterial pathogen. abstract. in addition to the por1 gene, which encodes the well-characterized voltage dependent anion-selective channel (yvdac1) of the mitochondrial outer membrane, the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a second gene (por2) encoding a protein (yvdac2) with 50% sequence identity to yvdac1. mitochondria isolated from yeast cells deleted for the por1 gene (δpor1) had a profoundly reduced outer membrane permeability as measured by the ability of an intermembrane space dehydrogenase to oxidize exogenously added nadh. mitochondria missing either yvdac1 or both yvdac1 and yvdac2 showed a 2-fold increase in the rate of nadh oxidation when the outer membrane was deliberately damaged. mitochondria from parental cells showed only a 10% increase indicating that the outer membrane is highly permeable to nadh. in the absence of yvdac1, we calculate that the outer membrane permeability to nadh is reduced 20-fold. the low nadh permeability in the presence of yvdac2 was not due to the low levels of yvdac2 expression as mitochondria from cells expressing levels of yvdac2 comparable to those of yvdac1 in parental cells showed no substantial increase in nadh permeability, indicating a minimal role of yvdac2 in this permeability. the residual permeability may be due to other pathways because cells missing both genes can still grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. however, yvdac1 is clearly the major pathway for nadh flux through the outer membrane in these mitochondria.
1. review of the literature ..................................................................... 1 1. abstract.glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) is a distant member of the transforming growth factor-β family and has potent neurotrophic effects on several classes of neurons including dopamine neurons and motoneurons. here, we have used in situ hybridization to describe the development of the cellular expression of gdnf mrna pre- and postnatally. consistent with dopaminotrophic activity, gdnf mrna is expressed in the developing basal ganglia and the olfactory tubercle. it is also found in a thalamic nucleus, in neurons of the substantia innominata, in the developing purkinje neurons and the developing locus coeruleus area, and in trigeminal brainstem nuclei. in the spinal cord, neuronal expression is found in clarke’s column. gdnf mrna is also expressed in the dorsal horns during development. additional gdnf mrna expression in the head region includes the carotid body, the retina, the vibrissae, the inner ear, the ear canal, and epithelium in the nasal cavity. prominent expression is also found in the developing teeth. the widespread expression of gdnf in developing skeletal muscle is consistent with trophic activity on α-motoneurons. the smooth muscle layers of the gastrointestinal tract are also strongly positive. a very strong signal is found in the outer mesenchyme of the developing metanephric kidney. we conclude that gdnf mrna is expressed in many different cellular systems inside and outside the central nervous system during development, suggesting multiple functions of gdnf in the developing organism.
the gradual heterogeneity of climatic factors poses varying selection pressures across geographic distances that leave signatures of clinal variation in the genome. separating signatures of clinal adaptation from signatures of other evolutionary forces, such as demographic processes, genetic drift and adaptation, to nonclinal conditions of the immediate local environment is a major challenge. here, we examine climate adaptation in five natural populations of the harlequin fly chironomus riparius sampled along a climatic gradient across europe. our study integrates experimental data, individual genome resequencing, pool‐seq data and population genetic modelling. common‐garden experiments revealed significantly different population growth rates at test temperatures corresponding to the population origin along the climate gradient, suggesting thermal adaptation on the phenotypic level. based on a population genomic analysis, we derived empirical estimates of historical demography and migration. we used an fst outlier approach to infer positive selection across the climate gradient, in combination with an environmental association analysis. in total, we identified 162 candidate genes as genomic basis of climate adaptation. enriched functions among these candidate genes involved the apoptotic process and molecular response to heat, as well as functions identified in studies of climate adaptation in other insects. our results show that local climate conditions impose strong selection pressures and lead to genomic adaptation despite strong gene flow. moreover, these results imply that selection to different climatic conditions seems to converge on a functional level, at least between different insect species. patterns of genetic diversity between populations are often used to detect loci under selection in genome scans. indeed, loci involved in local adaptations should show high fst values, whereas loci under balancing selection should rather show low fst values. most tests of selection based on fst use a null distribution generated under a simple island model of population differentiation. although this model has been shown to be robust, many species have a more complex genetic structure, with some populations sharing a recent ancestry or due to the presence of barriers to gene flow between different parts of a species range. in this paper, we propose the use of a hierarchical island model, in which demes exchange more migrants within groups than between groups, to generate the joint distribution of genetic diversity within and between populations. we show that tests not accounting for a hierarchical structure, when it exists, do generate a large excess of false positive loci, whereas the hierarchical island model is robust to uncertainties about the exact number of groups and demes per group in the system. our approach also explicitly takes into account the mutational process, and does not just rely on allele frequencies, which is important for short tandem repeat (str) data. an application to human and stickleback str data sets reveals a much lower number of significant loci than previously obtained under a non-hierarchical model. the elimination of false positive loci from genome scans should allow us to better determine on which specific class of genes selection is operating.
assembly of amyloid-beta peptide (aβ) into cytotoxic oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates is believed to be a major pathologic event in alzheimer's disease (ad) and interfering with aβ aggregation is an important strategy in the development of novel therapeutic approaches. prior studies have shown that the double n-methylated analogue of islet amyloid polypeptide (iapp) iapp-gi, which is a conformationally constrained iapp analogue mimicking a non-amyloidogenic iapp conformation, is capable of blocking cytotoxic self-assembly of aβ. here we investigate the interaction of iapp-gi with aβ40 and aβ42 using nmr spectroscopy. the most pronounced nmr chemical shift changes were observed for residues 13–20, while residues 7–9, 15–16 as well as the c-terminal half of aβ - that is both regions of the aβ sequence that are converted into β-strands in amyloid fibrils - were less accessible to solvent in the presence of iapp-gi. at the same time, interaction of iapp-gi with aβ resulted in a concentration-dependent co-aggregation of aβ and iapp-gi that was enhanced for the more aggregation prone aβ42 peptide. on the basis of the reduced toxicity of the aβ peptide in the presence of iapp-gi, our data are consistent with the suggestion that iapp-gi redirects aβ into nontoxic “off-pathway” aggregates. amyloid aggregates have been recognized to be a pathological hallmark of several fatal diseases, including alzheimer's disease, the prion-related diseases, and type ii diabetes. pancreatic amyloidosis is characterized by the deposition of amyloid consisting of islet amyloid polypeptide (iapp). we followed the steps preceding iapp insolubilization and amyloid formation in vitro using a variety of biochemical methods, including a filtration assay, far and near-uv circular dichroism (cd) spectropolarimetry, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ans) binding, and atomic force (afm) and electron (em) microscopy. iapp insolubilization and amyloid formation followed kinetics that were consistent with the nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. nucleation of iapp amyloid formation with traces of preformed fibrils induced a rapid conformational transition into beta-sheets that subsequently aggregated into insoluble amyloid fibrils. transition proceeded via a molten globule-like conformeric state with large contents of secondary structure, fluctuating tertiary and quaternary aromatic interactions, and strongly solvent-exposed hydrophobic patches. in the temperature denaturation pathway at 5 microm peptide, we found that this state was mostly populated at about 45 degrees c, and either aggregated rapidly into amyloid by prolonged exposure to this temperature, or melted into denaturated but still structured iapp, when heated further to 65 degrees c. the state at 45 degrees c was also found to be populated at 4.25 m gdnhcl at 25 degrees c during gdnhcl-induced equilibrium denaturation, and was stable in solution for several hours before aggregating into amyloid fibrils. our studies suggested that this amyloidogenic state was a self-associated form of an aggregation-prone, partially folded state of iapp. we propose that this partially folded population and its self-associated forms are in a concentration-dependent equilibrium with a non-amyloidogenic iapp conformer and may act as early, soluble precursors of beta-sheet and amyloid formation. our findings on the molecular mechanism of iapp amyloid formation in vitro should assist in gaining insight into the pathogenesis and inhibition of pancreatic amyloidosis and other amyloid-related diseases.
abstract the white-rot fungus trametes trogii excretes a main laccase showing a molecular mass of 70 kda, acidic isoelectric point and n-terminal sequence homol-ogous to that of several phenol oxidases. the purified enzyme oxidizes a number of phenolic and non-phenolic compounds; recalcitrant molecules may be converted into substrates by introducing, in the correct position, o-␣or p-orienting ring-activating groups. a veratryl alcohol oxidase (vao) enzyme was discovered in cultures of pleurotus ostreatus. the enzyme, which oxidizes veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde reducing o2 to h2o2, was purified to homogeneity and its main structural and catalytic properties have been determined. the enzyme is a glycoprotein and contains fad as a prosthetic group. the amino acid composition and carboxy- and amino-terminal sequences were determined. primary aromatic alcohols with methoxy substituents in position four are good substrates for vao; cinnamyl alcohol is the substrate which is oxidized faster whereas coniferyl alcohol is oxidized at a slower rate. the enzyme is moderately thermostable (t1/2(55 degrees c) about 1.5 h, apparent melting temperature about 60 degrees c). the enzyme stability in 50% water/organic solvents mixtures has also been studied.
objective: to determine dietary intake and eating patterns of older persons in israel and to identify factors associated with low intake.design: a cross-sectional study.setting: community-dwelling participants living in the beer-sheva area were interviewed at home, using a 24 h food questionnaire with additional questions regarding health and eating habits. dietary intake was compared between people aged 65–74 and 75 y and older.subjects: a total of 377 people over the age of 65 224 aged 65–74 and 153>75, were randomly selected from the negev population.results: dietary intake of energy, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins e, c and b1 were significantly lower for people aged 75 and older compared with people aged 65–74. low energy intake was associated with lower subjective health status for men (p<0.01), poor appetite (p<0.01) and more gastrointestinal problems (p<0.05) for women and lower snack consumption (p<0.01) for both genders. in a multivariate model, low energy intake was associated with low appetite and higher use of medication for both sexes and with frequency of eating alone and not consuming snacks for men.conclusion: dietary intake is lower among individuals older than 75 than in 65–74 y old. risk factors for low intake include poor appetite and health status, gastrointestinal problems, and eating alone. snacking enhanced dietary intake and should be encouraged in this group.sponsorship: goldman fund for ben-gurion university of the negev. objectives the aim of this study was to describe dietary intake and identify predictors of energy and protein intake in a group of high-risk elderly people.   methods all elderly persons receiving publicly financed home care services in the area of sherbrooke, quebec, canada, were eligible. subjects (n = 145) 60 to 94 years of age from three home care programs were interviewed to measure sociodemographic, health, and food-related behavior variables. three nonconsecutive 24-hour recalls were used to describe usual dietary intake. independent predictors of energy and protein intake were derived from multiple regression analyses.   results very low mean energy intakes were observed in this functionally dependent population. more than 50% of the study subjects did not meet the recommended levels of daily protein intake (0.8 g/kg body weight). significant independent determinants of intake were burden of disease, stress, poor appetite, and vision.   conclusions results suggest that community-living elderly people with loss of autonomy may have more nutritional problems than healthy elderly individuals. surveillance of predictors of dietary intake may enable early detection and prevention of nutritional deficits.
tropomyosin, a coiled-coil protein that binds along the length of the actin filament, is a universal regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. we have taken a bioinformatics/proteomic approach to studying structure-function relationships in this protein. the presence of a single, essential tropomyosin gene, cdc8, in fission yeast, schizosaccharomyces pombe, enables a systems-based approach to define the residues that are important for cellular functions. using molecular evolution methodologies we identified the most conserved residues and related them to the coiled coil structure. mutants in which one or more of 21 of the most conserved surface residues was mutated to ala were tested for the ability to rescue growth of a temperature-sensitive cdc8 mutant when overexpressed at the restrictive temperature. based on altered morphology of the septum and actin cytoskeleton, we selected three sets of mutations for construction of mutant cdc8 strains using marker reconstitution mutagenesis and analysis of recombinant protein in vitro: d16a.k30a, v114s.e117a.h118a and r121a.d131a.e138a. the mutations have sequence-specific effects on cellular morphology including cell length, organization of cytoskeletal structures (actin patches, actin cables and contractile rings), and in vitro actin affinity, lending credence to the proteomic approach introduced here. we propose that bioinformatics is a valid analysis tool for defining structure-function relationships in conserved proteins in this model organism. background: the regulation of the conformational dynamics of cellular actin structures is poorly understood. results: myosin and tropomyosin stabilize the conformation of formin-nucleated flexible actin filaments. conclusion: actin-binding proteins can play a central role in the establishment of the conformational properties of actin filaments. significance: our results add to our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the conformational and functional versatility of the actin cytoskeleton. the conformational elasticity of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for its versatile biological functions. increasing evidence supports that the interplay between the structural and functional properties of actin filaments is finely regulated by actin-binding proteins; however, the underlying mechanisms and biological consequences are not completely understood. previous studies showed that the binding of formins to the barbed end induces conformational transitions in actin filaments by making them more flexible through long range allosteric interactions. these conformational changes are accompanied by altered functional properties of the filaments. to get insight into the conformational regulation of formin-nucleated actin structures, in the present work we investigated in detail how binding partners of formin-generated actin structures, myosin and tropomyosin, affect the conformation of the formin-nucleated actin filaments using fluorescence spectroscopic approaches. time-dependent fluorescence anisotropy and temperature-dependent förster-type resonance energy transfer measurements revealed that heavy meromyosin, similarly to tropomyosin, restores the formin-induced effects and stabilizes the conformation of actin filaments. the stabilizing effect of heavy meromyosin is cooperative. the kinetic analysis revealed that despite the qualitatively similar effects of heavy meromyosin and tropomyosin on the conformational dynamics of actin filaments the mechanisms of the conformational transition are different for the two proteins. heavy meromyosin stabilizes the formin-nucleated actin filaments in an apparently single step reaction upon binding, whereas the stabilization by tropomyosin occurs after complex formation. these observations support the idea that actin-binding proteins are key elements of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the conformational and functional diversity of actin filaments in living cells.
malnutrition is considered as an independent risk factor for morbidity, mortality and a prolonged hospital stay for in-hospital patients. while most available data on the impact of malnutrition on health-related and financial implications refer to gastroenterologic or abdominal surgery patients, little is known about the impact of malnutrition on ear nose throat (ent)/head and neck surgery patients. the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of malnutrition on morbidity and length of hospital stay in an elective ent/head and neck surgery patient cohort. the study was performed as a single-center, prospective cohort study at a tertiary referral centre. nutritional risk at admission was assessed using the nrs-2002 screening tool. multivariate regression models were used to determine independent risk factors for complications and a prolonged hospitalization. three hundred fifty one participants were included in the study. a malignant disease was found in 62 participants (17.7 %). 62 patients (17.7 %) were at a moderate to severe risk of malnutrition. a bad general health condition and complications during hospital stay could be identified as independent risk factors for a prolonged hospitalization. patients with a malignant tumor showed a more than fourfold higher risk of developing at least one complication. malnutrition, however, was not statistically associated with a higher complication rate or a prolonged hospital stay. our data suggests that malnutrition does not seem to play such an important role as a risk factor for complications and a prolonged hospital stay in ent patients as it does in other disciplines like abdominal surgery or gastroenterology. background/objectives:invasive procedures such as surgery cause immunosuppression, leading to increased risk of complications, infections and extended hospital stay. emerging research around immune-enhancing nutrition supplements and their ability to reduce postoperative complications and reduce treatment costs is promising. this randomised controlled trial aims to examine the effect of preoperative immunonutrition supplementation on length of hospital stay (los), complications and treatment costs in both well-nourished and malnourished gastrointestinal surgery patients.subjects/methods:ninety-five patients undergoing elective upper and lower gastrointestinal surgery were recruited. the treatment group (n=46) received a commercial immuno-enhancing supplement 5 days preoperatively. the control group (n=49) received no supplements. the primary outcome measure was los, and secondary outcome measures included complications and cost.results:a nonsignificant trend towards a shorter los within the treatment group was observed (7.1±4.1 compared with 8.8±6.5 days; p=0.11). for malnourished patients, this trend was greater with hospital stay reduced by 4 days (8.3±3.5 vs 12.3±9.5 days; p=0.21). complications and unplanned intensive care admission rates were very low in both the groups. the average admission cost was reduced by aud1576 in the treatment group compared with the control group (p=0.37).conclusions:preoperative immunonutrition therapy in gastrointestinal surgery has the potential to reduce the los and cost, with greater treatment benefit seen in malnourished patients; however, there is a need for additional research with greater patient numbers.
atherothrombosis, thrombus formation as a result of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, is a major modern health problem, often underlying coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. after the treatment of an acute thrombotic episode, long-term therapy is warranted as a secondary prophylaxis of such events and their complications. because of the importance of platelets’ involvement in the initiation and propagation of thrombosis, antiplatelet drugs have come to the forefront of atherothrombotic disease treatment. dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin plus clopidogrel – the current standard – has its benefits, but it also has its limitations with regard to its pharmacologic properties and adverse effects. for these reasons, within the last decade or so, the investigation of novel antiplatelet agents has prospered. here, we review the main pathways through which platelets participate in acute thrombosis and the interruption of these pathways by using novel antiplatelet agents, including p2y12 receptor antagonists (the recently approved prasugrel, the probable next-in-line ticagrelor, and others). the need for a more individualized patient therapy is evident; although most of the aforementioned pharmaceuticals have the potential to contribute to this, their clinical utility remains to be seen. dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel decreases the rate of stent thrombosis in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (pci). however, despite intensified antiplatelet treatment, up to 4.7% of the patients undergoing coronary stenting develop thrombotic stent occlusion, suggesting incomplete platelet inhibition due to clopidogrel resistance. we evaluated the percentage of clopidogrel non-responders among 105 patients with coronary artery disease (cad) undergoing elective pci. all patients were treated regularly with aspirin 100 mg/d and received a loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg/d before pci. clopidogrel non-responders were defined by an inhibition of adp (5 and 20 mol/l) induced platelet aggregation that was less than 10% when compared to baseline values 4 h after clopidogrel intake. semi-responders were identified by an inhibition of 10 to 29%. patients with an inhibition over 30% were regarded as responders. we found that 5 (adp 5 mol/l) to 11% (adp 20 mol/l) of the patients were non-responders and 9 to 26% were semi-responders. among the group of non-responders there were two incidents of subacute stent thrombosis after pci. we conclude that a subgroup of patients undergoing pci does not adequately respond to clopidogrel, which may correspond to the occurrence of thromboischemic complications. point-of-care testing may help to identify these patients who may then benefit from an alternative antiplatelet therapy.
klotho (kl), originally discovered as an aging suppressor, is a membrane protein that shares sequence similarity with the β-glucosidase enzymes. recent reports showed klotho might play a role in adipocyte maturation and systemic glucose metabolism. however, little is known about the transcription factors involved in regulating the expression of porcine kl gene. deletion fragment analysis identified kl-d2 (−418 bp to −3 bp) as the porcine kl core promoter. marc0022311snp (a or g) in kl intron 1 was detected in landrace × div pigs using the porcine snp60 beadchip. the pgl-d2-a and pgl-d2-g were constructed with kl-d2 and the intron fragment of different alleles and relative luciferase activity of pgl3-d2-g was significantly higher than that of pgl3-d2-a in the pk cells and st cells. this was possibly the result of a change in kl binding ability with transcription factor organic cation transporter 1 (oct-1), which was confirmed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (emsa) and chromatin immune-precipitation (chip). moreover, oct-1 regulated endogenous kl expression by rna interference experiments. our study indicates snp marc0022311 affects porcine kl expression by regulating its promoter activity via oct-1. klotho is a multifunctional protein involved in numerous biological functions, ranging from mineral ion metabolism to signaling activities. recent studies have identified klotho as a target gene for peroxi‐some proliferator‐activated receptor‐γ (ppar‐γ), a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, and an adipo‐genesis‐promoting factor. in a similar line of observation, eliminating klotho function from mice resulted in the generation of lean mice with almost no detectable fat tissue. in contrast to the klotho‐knockout mice (11.7±0.3 g at 9 wk), leptin‐deficient (ob/ob) mice are severely obese (49.3±0.6 g at 9 wk), due to excessive fat accumulation. to study the in vivo role of klotho in obesity, we have generated and characterized ob/ob mice lacking klotho activity [ob/ob‐klotho double‐knockout (dko) mice]. the ob/ob mice started to get bigger from 3 wk onward and gained almost 2 times more weight than their wild‐type (wt) counterparts (wt vs. ob/ob: 34.8±1.3 vs. 65.5±1.2 g at 21 wk). the generated ob/ob‐klotho dko mice were not only viable throughout their adulthood but also showed markedly reduced fat tissue accumulation compared to their ob/ob littermates. the ob/ob‐klotho dko mice had significantly (p<0.01) less retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and epididymal fat accumulation, compared to their ob/ob counterparts. similarly, the fatty liver that was consistently observed in the ob/ob mice was eliminated in the ob/ob‐klotho dko mice. such structural improvement in the liver was also evident from markedly reduced fasting blood glucose levels in ob/ob‐klotho dko mice, compared to their ob/ob counterparts (ob/ob vs. ob/ob‐klotho dko: 266 ± 36 vs. 65 ±2 mg/dl). finally, to study whether the absence of klotho can induce resistance to high‐fat‐diet‐induced obesity, we provided a high‐fat (60%) diet to klotho‐knockout mice and compared them with normal‐fat (20%) diet‐fed klotho‐knockout mice. no significant difference in body weight was detected in klotho‐knockout mice fed either the normal‐fat diet or high‐fat diet, while wt mice fed the high‐fat diet gradually gained body weight, compared to the normal‐fat‐diet‐fed counterparts. the results of our dietary and genetic manipulation studies provide in vivo evidence for a role of klotho in obesity and offer a novel target to manipulate obesity and associated complications.—ohnishi, m., kato, s., akiyoshi, j., atfi, a., razzaque, m. s., dietary and genetic evidence for enhancing glucose metabolism and reducing obesity by inhibiting klotho functions. faseb j. 25, 2031–2039 (2011). www.fasebj.org
we investigated the role of amidated neuropeptides, and specifically pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (pacap), in olfactory neurogenesis and olfactory receptor neuronal survival. using both immunohistochemistry and in situhybridization, we find that both peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (pam), the enzyme responsible for amidation and therefore activation of all amidated neuropeptides, and amidated pacap are expressed in developing and adult olfactory epithelium. amidated pacap is highly expressed in proliferative basal cells and in immature olfactory neurons. the pacap-specific receptor pac1receptor is also expressed in this population, establishing that these cells can be pacap responsive. experiments were conducted to determine whether amidated neuropeptides, such as pacap38, might function in olfactory neurogenesis and neuronal survival. addition of pacap38 to olfactory cultures increased the number of neurons to >250% of control and stimulated neuronal proliferation and survival. in primary olfactory cultures, pharmacologically decreased pam activity, as well as neutralization of pacap38, caused neuron-specific loss that was reversed by pacap38. mottled (brindled) mice, which lack a functional atp7a copper transporter and serve as a model for menkes disease, provided an in vivo partial loss-of-function pam knock-out. these mice had decreased amidated pacap production and concomitant decreased numbers of olfactory receptor neurons. these data establish amidated peptides and specifically pacap as having important roles in proliferation in the olfactory system and suggest that a similar function exists in vivo. posttranslational processing of peptide precursors frequently includes cooh-terminal amidation by the bifunctional enzyme peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (pam). we examined the ontogeny of pam gene expression using in situ hybridization and detected expression in the cardiogenic region beginning at embryonic day 9 (e9) and in decidualizing uterine endometrium and myometrial smooth muscle at even earlier postimplantation stages. pam expression in the cns at e10 was highest in the dorsal spinal cord and floor plate and exhibited complex patterning in several cns regions, including the ventricular zone, over the next several days with pam expression first detected in neurons at e13. high levels of pam expression characterized several nonneural cell populations as well, including limb mesoderm and the mesenchyme immediately adjacent to nasal, maxillary, palatal, and dental epithelia during tissue fusion and remodeling. since alternative splicing generates pam transcripts encoding proproteins that are differentially localized and processed, we used probes that distinguish major subsets of pam transcripts to determine that transcripts encoding integral membrane pam isoforms predominate in most, if not all, pam-expressing cell types throughout development. further, transcripts that encode soluble and cleavable pam isoforms are essentially absent from two cns areas that are rich in transcripts encoding integral membrane, bifunctional pam: the ependymal region of the spinal cord and the ventricular zone of the hippocampus. these results provide evidence for widespread expression and cell-type-specific alternative splicing of pam during development and raise the possibility that region-specific amidation of pam substrates contributes significantly to several developmental processes.

(2007) literature review: a snowballing method was used, utilising references from key papers in the field – as it was felt that a systematic approach would generate too many papers for inclusion. this paper considered the political science literature, which had previously remained autonomous to the kte literature – uniting the two aspects. context this article presents the main results from a large-scale analytical systematic review on knowledge exchange interventions at the organizational and policymaking levels. the review integrated two broad traditions, one roughly focused on the use of social science research results and the other focused on policymaking and lobbying processes.   methods data collection was done using systematic snowball sampling. first, we used prospective snowballing to identify all documents citing any of a set of thirty-three seminal papers. this process identified 4,102 documents, 102 of which were retained for in-depth analysis. the bibliographies of these 102 documents were merged and used to identify retrospectively all articles cited five times or more and all books cited seven times or more. all together, 205 documents were analyzed. to develop an integrated model, the data were synthesized using an analytical approach.   findings this article developed integrated conceptualizations of the forms of collective knowledge exchange systems, the nature of the knowledge exchanged, and the definition of collective-level use. this literature synthesis is organized around three dimensions of context: level of polarization (politics), cost-sharing equilibrium (economics), and institutionalized structures of communication (social structuring).   conclusions the model developed here suggests that research is unlikely to provide context-independent evidence for the intrinsic efficacy of knowledge exchange strategies. to design a knowledge exchange intervention to maximize knowledge use, a detailed analysis of the context could use the kind of framework developed here.
because spinal cord injuries can have fatal consequences for injured race car drivers, prehospital treatment of spinal injuries is a major concern in motor sports. a structured procedure for assessing trauma patients and their treatment should follow established abcde principles. only then, a stable patient could be further examined and appropriate measures can be undertaken. for patients in an acute life-threatening condition, rapid transport must be initiated and should not be delayed by measures that are not indicated. if a competitor must first be extricated from the racing vehicle, the correct method of extrication must be chosen. to avoid secondary injury to the spine after a racing accident, in-line extrication from the vehicle and immobilization of the patient are standard procedures in motor sports and have been used for decades. since immobilization can be associated with disadvantages and complications, the need for immobilization of trauma patients outside of motor sports medicine has become the subject of an increasing number of reports in the scientific literature. even in motor sports, where specific safety systems that offer spinal protection are present, the indications for spinal immobilization need to be carefully considered rather than being blindly adopted as a matter of course. the aim of this article is to use recent literature to present an overview about the treatment of spinal injuries in motor sports. further, we present a new protocol for indications for immobilizing the spine in motor sports that is based on the abcde principles and takes into account the condition of the patient. background spinal immobilisation during extrication of patients in road traffic collisions is routinely used despite the lack of evidence for this practice. in a previous proof of concept study (n=1), we recorded up to four times more cervical spine movement during extrication using conventional techniques than self-controlled extrication. objective the objective of this study was to establish, using biomechanical analysis which technique provides the minimal deviation of the cervical spine from the neutral in-line position during extrication from a vehicle in a larger sample of variable age, height and mass. methods a crew of two paramedics and four fire-fighters extricated 16 immobilised participants from a vehicle using six techniques for each participant. participants were marked with biomechanical sensors and relative movement between the sensors was captured via high-speed infrared motion analysis cameras. a three-dimensional mathematical model was developed and a repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare movement across extrication techniques. results controlled self-extrication without a collar resulted in a mean movement of 13.33° from the neutral in-line position of the cervical spine compared to a mean movement of 18.84° during one of the equipment-aided extrications. two equipment-aided techniques had significantly higher movement (p<0.05) than other techniques. both height (p=0.003) and mass (p=0.02) of the participants were significant independent predictors of movement. conclusions these data support the findings of the proof of concept study, for haemodynamically stable patients controlled self-extrication causes less movement of the cervical spine than extrications performed using traditional prehospital rescue equipment.
requirements for choosing off-the-shelf information systems (oisr) differ from requirements for development of new information systems in that they do not necessarily provide complete specifications, thus allowing flexibility in matching an existing is to the stated needs. we present a framework for oisr conceptual models that consists of four essential elements: business processes, business rules, information objects and required system services. we formalise the definitions of these concepts based on an ontological model. the ontology-based oisr model provides a framework to evaluate modelling languages on how appropriate they are for oisr requirements specifications. the evaluation framework is applied to the object-process methodology, and its results are compared with a similar evaluation of aris. this comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the ontological framework for evaluating modelling tools on how well they can guide selection, implementation and integration of purchased software packages. abstract. information systems analysis and design (isad) methodologies provide facilities for describing existing or conceived real‐world systems. these facilities are ontologically expressive if they are capable of describing all real‐world phenomena completely and clearly. in this paper we formally examine the notion of the ontological expressiveness of a grammar and discuss some of its implications for the design and use of isad methodologies. we identify some generic ways in which ontological expressiveness may be undermined in a grammar and some potential consequences of these violations. we also examine ontological expressiveness within the context of some other desirable features that might be considered in the design of isad methodologies.
tendons and ligaments play key roles in the musculoskeletal system in both man and animals. both tissues can undergo traumatic injury, age‐related degeneration and chronic disease, causing discomfort, pain and increased susceptibility to wider degenerative joint disease. to date, tendon and ligament ultrastructural biology is relatively under‐studied in healthy, non‐diseased tissues. this information is essential to understand the pathology of these tissues with regard to function‐related injury and to assist with the future development of tissue‐engineered tendon and ligament structures. this study investigated the morphological, compositional and extracellular matrix protein distribution differences between tendons and ligaments around the non‐diseased canine stifle joint. the morphological, structural characteristics of different regions of the periarticular tendons and ligaments (the intra‐articular anterior cruciate ligament, the extra‐articular medial collateral ligament, the positional long digital extensor tendon and energy‐storing superficial digital flexor tendons) were identified using a novel semi‐objective histological scoring analysis and by determining their biochemical composition. protein distribution of extracellular matrix collagens, proteoglycans and elastic fibre proteins in anterior cruciate ligament and long digital extensor tendon were also determined using immunostaining techniques. the anterior cruciate ligament was found to have significant morphological differences in comparison with the other three tissues, including less compact collagen architecture, differences in cell nuclei phenotype and increased glycosaminoglycan and elastin content. intra‐ and interobserver differences of histology scoring resulted in an average score 0.7, indicative of good agreement between observers. statistically significant differences were also found in the extracellular matrix composition in terms of glycosaminoglycan and elastin content, being more prominent in the anterior cruciate ligament than in the other three tissues. a different distribution of several extracellular matrix proteins was also found between long digital extensor tendon and anterior cruciate ligament, with a significantly increased immunostaining of aggrecan and versican in the anterior cruciate ligament. these findings directly relate to the different functions of tendon and ligament and indicate that the intra‐articular anterior cruciate ligament is subjected to more compressive forces, reflecting an adaptive response to normal or increased loads and resulting in different extracellular matrix composition and arrangement to protect the tissue from damage. the anterior cruciate ligament (acl) is a band of dense connective tissue which courses from the femur to the tibia. the acl is a key structure in the knee joint, as it resists anterior tibial translation and rotational loads. when the knee is extended, the acl has a mean length of 32 mm and a width of 7–12 mm. there are two components of the acl, the anteromedial bundle (amb) and the posterolateral bundle (plb). they are not isometric with the main change being lengthening of the amb and shortening of the plb during flexion. the acl has a microstructure of collagen bundles of multiple types (mostly type i) and a matrix made of a network of proteins, glycoproteins, elastic systems, and glycosaminoglycans with multiple functional interactions. the complex ultrastructural organization and abundant elastic system of the acl allow it to withstand multiaxial stresses and varying tensile strains. the acl is innervated by posterior articular branches of the tibial nerve and is vascularized by branches of the middle genicular artery.
foreign object damage (fod) occurs when hard, millimeter-sized objects such as gravel or sand are ingested into aircraft jet engines. particles impacting turbine blades at velocities up to about 300 m=s produce small indentation craters which can become sites for fatigue crack initiation, severely limiting the lifetime of the blade. a framework for analyzing fod and its e5ect on fatigue cracking is established in this paper. finite element analysis is used to determine the residual stresses and geometric stress concentration resulting from fod. the roles of material rate sensitivity and inertia are delineated. the most important non-dimensional parameters governing impact indents are identi7ed, signi7cantly reducing the set of independent parameters. the second step in the analysis focuses on the potency of cracks emerging from critical locations at the indents. the results have been used to address the question: when and to what extent do the residual stresses and stress concentration caused by fod reduce the critical crack size associated with threshold fatigue crack growth? for deep indents, it is found that elastic stress concentration is the dominant factor in reducing critical crack threshold when the applied cyclic load ratio, r, is large, otherwise the residual stresses are also important. comparisons with a set of experiments conducted in parallel with the theory show that the numerical approach can account for various phenomena observed in practice. ? 2002 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved. the role of foreign-object damage (fod) and its effect on high-cycle fatigue (hgf) failures in a turbine engine ti– 6al–4v alloy is examined in the context of the use of the kitagawa–takahashi diagram to describe the limiting conditions for such failures. experimentally, fod is simulated by firing 1and 3.2 mm diameter steel spheres onto the flat specimen surface of tensile fatigue specimens at velocities of 200 and 300 m/s. such damage was found to markedly reduce the fatigue strength of the alloy, primarily due to four factors: stress concentration, microcrack formation, impact-induced plasticity and tensile residual stresses associated with the impact damage. two groups of fatigue failures could be identified. the first group initiated directly at the impact site, and can be readily described through the use of a fatigue-crack growth threshold concept. specifically, a kitagawa–takahashi approach is presented where the limiting threshold conditions are defined by the stress-concentration corrected smooth-bar fatigue limit (at microstructurally small crack sizes) and a ‘‘worst-case’’ fatigue-crack growth threshold (at larger crack sizes). the second group of failures was caused by fatigue cracks that initiated at locations far from the impact site in regions of high tensile residual stresses, the magnitude of which was computed numerically and measured experimentally using synchrotron x-ray diffraction. specifically, these failures could be rationalized due to the superposition of the residual stresses on the farfield applied mean stress, leading to a locally elevated load ratio (ratio of minimum to maximum loads). the effects of residual stress, stress concentration, and microstructurally small cracks are combined in a modified kitagawa– takahashi approach to provide a mechanistic basis for evaluating the detrimental effect of fod on hcf failures in ti– 6al–4v blade alloys. 2002 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.
a longitudinal study of 298 rural bangladeshi infants found evidence of growth faltering starting at 3 months of age. anthropometric status declined substantially in the first 2 years of life, with weight-for-height (whz) falling from - 0.49 to - 1.75, weight-for-age (waz) from - 1.18 to - 2.87 and height-for-age (haz) from - 1.00 to - 1.88. higher concentrations of the acute-phase protein alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (agp) and higher gut mucosal damage (as signified by raised lactulose:mannitol (l:m) ratios) were both associated with chronic malnutrition as indicated by poorer haz and waz scores (p = 0.011 and 0.005 for agp and 0.039 and 0.019 for l:m ratio, respectively). higher hb levels were related to improved z-scores, while elevation of giardia-specific igm titre (gsigm) was associated with poor waz and whz (p = 0.015 and 0.039, respectively). igg did not show any significant association with z-scores and the l:m ratio did not correlate with any of the inflammation markers or giardia infection. the prevalence of geohelminth infections was low (only 4 % in the total study period). however, the level of gsigm indicated high endemicity of giardia infection from early in life, although very few cysts were detected from stool samples. these findings suggest that rural bangladeshi infants are being exposed to high levels of infection with concomitant gut damage and growth faltering. human milk was shown to inhibit adherence of giardia at concentrations as low as 0.5%. unsaturated fatty acids were also found to cause significant inhibitory effects on adherence, with ed50 values less than 1 microm for arachidonic, linoleic and palmitic acids. a variety of infant feeding formulae derived from cow's milk and soy bean had suppressive effects on adherence. these observations may explain in part the low prevalence of giardiasis in young infants.
previously, we introduced causal mapping (cmap) as an easy to use systems biology tool for studying the behavior of biological processes that occur at the cellular and molecular level. cmap is a coarse-grained graphical modeling approach in which the system of interest is modeled as an interaction map between functional elements of the system, in a manner similar to portrayals of signaling pathways commonly used by molecular cell biologists. cmap describes details of the interactions while maintaining the simplicity of other qualitative methods (e.g., boolean networks).in this paper, we use the cmap methodology as a tool for generating hypotheses about the mechanisms that regulate molecular and cellular systems. furthermore, our approach allows competing hypotheses to be ranked according to a fitness index and suggests experimental tests to distinguish competing high fitness hypotheses. to motivate the cmap as a hypotheses generating tool and demonstrate the methodology, we first apply this protocol to a simple test-case of a three-element signaling module. our methods are next applied to the more complex phenomenon of cortical oscillations observed in spreading cells. this analysis produces two high fitness hypotheses for the mechanism that underlies this dynamic behavior and suggests experiments to distinguish the hypotheses. the method can be widely applied to other cellular systems to generate and compare alternative hypotheses based on experimentally observed data and using computer simulations. actomyosin-based cortical contractility is a common feature of eukaryotic cells but the capability to produce rhythmic contractions is found in only a few types such as cardiomyocytes. mechanisms responsible for the acquisition of this capability remain largely unknown. rhythmic contractility can be induced in non-muscle cells by microtubule depolymerization. spreading epithelial cells and fibroblasts in which microtubules were depolymerized with nocodazole or colcemid underwent rhythmic oscillations of the body that lasted for several hours before the cells acquired a stable, flattened shape. by contrast, control cells spread and flattened into discoid shapes in a smooth and regular manner. quantitative analysis of the oscillations showed that they have a period of about 50 seconds. the kinase inhibitors, ha 1077 and h7, and the more specific rho-kinase inhibitor, y 27632, caused the oscillations to immediately cease and the cells to become flat. transient increases in cytoplasmic calcium preceded the contractile phase of the oscillations. wrinkle formation by cells plated on elastic substrata indicated that the contractility of colcemid-treated cells increased in comparison to controls but was drastically decreased after ha 1077 addition. these data suggest that an intact microtubular system normally prevents pulsations by moderating excessive rho-mediated actin myosin contractility. possible mechanistic interactions between rho-mediated and calcium activated contractile pathways that could produce morphological oscillations are discussed.
backgroundthe enzymes for efficient hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass are a major factor in the development of an economically feasible cellulose bioconversion process. up to now, low hydrolysis efficiency and high production cost of cellulases remain the significant hurdles in this process. the aim of the present study was to develop a versatile cellulase system with the enhanced hydrolytic efficiency and the ability to synthesize powerful inducers by genetically engineering trichoderma reesei.resultsin our study, we employed a systematic genetic strategy to construct the carbon catabolite-derepressed strain t. reesei scb18 to produce the cellulase complex that exhibited a strong cellulolytic capacity for biomass saccharification and an extraordinary high β-glucosidase (bgl) activity for cellulase-inducing disaccharides synthesis. we first identified the hypercellulolytic and uracil auxotrophic strain t. reesei sp4 as carbon catabolite repressed, and then deleted the carbon catabolite repressor gene cre1 in the genome. we found that the deletion of cre1 with the selectable marker pyrg led to a 72.6% increase in total cellulase activity, but a slight reduction in saccharification efficiency. to facilitate the following genetic modification, the marker pyrg was successfully removed by homologous recombination based on resistance to 5-foa. furthermore, the aspergillus niger bgla-encoding gene bgla was overexpressed, and the generated strain t. reesei scb18 exhibited a 29.8% increase in total cellulase activity and a 51.3-fold enhancement in bgl activity (up to 103.9 iu/ml). we observed that the cellulase system of scb18 showed significantly higher saccharification efficiency toward differently pretreated corncob residues than the control strains sdc11 and sp4. moreover, the crude enzyme preparation from scb18 with high bgl activity possessed strong transglycosylation ability to synthesize β-disaccharides from glucose. the transglycosylation product was finally utilized as the inducer for cellulase production, which provided a 63.0% increase in total cellulase activity compared to the frequently used soluble inducer, lactose.conclusionsin summary, we constructed a versatile cellulase system in t. reesei for efficient biomass saccharification and powerful cellulase inducer synthesis by combinational genetic manipulation of three distinct types of genes to achieve the customized cellulase production, thus providing a viable strategy for further strain improvement to reduce the cost of biomass-based biofuel production. background: β-glucosidase completes cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis by releasing glucose from cellobiose. results: saxs experiments revealed that aspergillus niger β-glucosidase has a cellulase-like tadpole molecular shape, uncommon to enzymes that act on the soluble substrates. conclusion: we show that anbgl1 n- and c-terminal domains are linked by a long extended linker. significance: understanding anbgl1 architecture is useful for comprehension of the enzyme-cell wall interaction and the process of biomass saccharification. aspergillus niger is known to secrete large amounts of β-glucosidases, which have a variety of biotechnological and industrial applications. here, we purified an a. niger β-glucosidase (anbgl1) and conducted its biochemical and biophysical analyses. purified enzyme with an apparent molecular mass of 116 kda forms monomers in solution as judged by native gel electrophoresis and has a pi value of 4.55, as found for most of the fungi of β-glucosidases. surprisingly, the small angle x-ray experiments reveal that anbgl1 has a tadpole-like structure, with the n-terminal catalytic domain and c-terminal fibronectin iii-like domain (fniii) connected by the long linker peptide (∼100 amino acid residues) in an extended conformation. this molecular organization resembles the one adopted by other cellulases (such as cellobiohydrolases, for example) that frequently contain a catalytic domain linked to the cellulose-binding module that mediates their binding to insoluble and polymeric cellulose. the reasons why anbgl1, which acts on the small soluble substrates, has a tadpole molecular shape are not entirely clear. however, our enzyme pulldown assays with different polymeric substrates suggest that anbgl1 has little or no capacity to bind to and to adsorb cellulose, xylan, and starch, but it has high affinity to lignin. molecular dynamics simulations suggested that clusters of residues located in the c-terminal fniii domain interact strongly with lignin fragments. the simulations showed that numerous arginine residues scattered throughout the fniii surface play an important role in the interaction with lignin by means of cation-π stacking with the lignin aromatic rings. these results indicate that the c-terminal fniii domain could be operational for immobilization of the enzyme on the cell wall and for the prevention of unproductive binding of cellulase to the biomass lignin.
the aim of this study was to investigate the possible time- and dose-dependent cytotoxic effects of cobalt chloride on vero cells. the cultured cells were incubated with different concentrations of cobalt chloride ranging from 0.5 to 1,000 μm, and cytotoxicity was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt) and resazurin assays. possible protective effects of vitamin e, coenzyme q10, and zinc chloride were also tested in this system. a gradual decrease in cell proliferation was observed at concentrations ~≥200 μm in incubation periods of 24, 48, 72, and 96 h with mtt assay. exposure of cells to 500 and 1,000 μm cobalt chloride caused significant decrease in cell survival. a biphasic survival profile of cells was observed at 1–25 μm concentration range following 96 h of incubation. with resazurin assay, cytotoxicity profile of cocl2 was found comparable to the results of mtt assay, particularly at high concentrations and long incubation periods. dose-dependent cytotoxicity was noted following exposure of cells to ≥250 μm of cocl2 for 24 h and ≥100 μm concentrations of cocl2 for 48–96 h. pretreatment of cells with zncl2 for 4 or 24 h provided significant protection against cobalt chloride-induced cytotoxicity when measured with mtt assay. however, vitamin e or coenzyme q10 was not protective. cocl2 had dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effects in vero cells. preventive effect of zncl2 against cocl2-induced cytotoxicity should be considered in detail to define exact mechanism of toxicity in vero cells. the effects of cocl(2) on retinoic acid (ra)-treated embryoid bodies (ebs) were investigated. four-day ebs were treated with 5x10(-6) m of ra for 4 d, then subjected to attached culturing for 7 d in the presence of cocl(2) at 0, 20, and 100 microm. differentiation into map2- and gfap-immunopositive cells was inhibited by cocl(2) in a dose-dependent manner. next, ra-treated ebs were dissociated into single cells and cultured for 7 d at an initial cell density of 1x10(3)/cm(2). the number of cells increased in a cocl(2)-dose dependent fashion. in cultures with 100 microm of cocl(2), more than 90% of the cells were immunopositive for nestin and nestin-immunopositive cells formed clusters, while there were few cells immunopositive for map2 or gfap. these results suggest that cocl(2) inhibits neural differentiation of ra-treated eb cells and promotes the proliferation of nestin-immunopositive cells, i.e., embryonic stem (es)-derived neural stem-like cells.
the role of estrogen signaling in regulating prostate tumorigenesis is relatively underexplored. although, an increasing body of evidence has linked estrogen receptor beta (erβ) to prostate cancer, the function of estrogen receptor alpha (erα) in prostate cancer is not very well studied. we have discovered a novel role of erα in the pathogenesis of prostate tumors. here, we show that prostate cancer cells express erα and estrogen induces oncogenic properties in prostate cancer cells through erα. importantly, erα knockdown in the human prostate cancer pacmetut1 cells as well as pharmacological inhibition of erα with ici 182,780 inhibited osteoblastic lesion formation and lung metastasis in vivo. co-culture of pre-osteoblasts with cancer cells showed a significant induction of osteogenic markers in the pre-osteoblasts, which was attenuated by knockdown of erα in cancer cells suggesting that estrogen/erα signaling promotes crosstalk between cancer and osteoblastic progenitors to stimulate osteoblastic tumorigenesis. these results suggest that erα expression in prostate cancer cells is essential for osteoblastic lesion formation and lung metastasis. thus, inhibition of erα signaling in prostate cancer cells may be a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit the osteoblastic lesion development as well as lung metastasis in patients with advanced prostate cancer. bone metastases are complications of multiple myeloma and solid tumors, including breast and prostate carcinomas. several reports have demonstrated that the preference to metastasize to bone by tumor cells is not a casual but an addressed event, which relies on specific interactions among tumor cells, bone marrow microenvironment and bone cells. one of the features that gives tumor cells more chances to survive and proliferate into the bone tissue is osteomimicry, that is the ability to acquire a bone cell phenotype, especially osteoblast-like. as clearly demonstrated, prostate and breast cancer cells try to resemble osteoblasts by expressing bone matrix proteins, the specific marker alkaline phosphatase, and molecules regulating the osteoblast/osteoclast cross-talk. based on this evidence it is crucial to dissect in more detail the molecular mechanisms underlying the osteomimetic properties of cancer cells and identify new therapeutic targets eventually leading to a better and prolonged life expectation for patients with bone.
use case templates can be used to describe functional requirements of a software product line. however, to the best of our knowledge, no efforts have been made to collect and summarize these existing templates and no empirical evaluation of the use cases’ comprehensibility provided by these templates has been addressed yet. the contributions of this paper are twofold. first, we present a systematic mapping study about the spl variability description using textual use cases. from this mapping, we found twelve spl use case templates and observed the need not only for the application of these templates in real spl but also for supporting tools. secondly, this work presents an evaluation of the comprehensibility of spl use cases specified in these templates through a controlled experiment with 48 volunteers. the results of this experiment show that the specification of variabilities in the steps’ numeric identifiers of the textual use cases is better to the use case understanding than the other approaches identified. we also found evidence that the specification of variabilities at the end of the use cases favors the comprehension of them and the use of questions associated to the variation points in the use cases improves the understanding of use cases. we conclude that each characteristic of the existing templates has an impact on the spl use case understanding and this should be taken into account when choosing one. the derivation of system test cases for product families is difficult due to variability in the requirements, since each variation point multiplies the number of possible behaviors to be tested. this paper proposes an approach to develop domain test cases from use cases that contain variabilities and to derive application test cases from them. the basic idea to avoid combinatorial explosion is to preserve the variability in domain test cases. new strategies to capture variability in test cases are suggested, which in combination help dealing with all basic types of variability in a use case and in its relationships (e.g., include >>).
this paper proposes a novel distributed architecture for controlling heating, ventilation and air conditioning (hvac) systems in commercial buildings. zone modules use local models and measurements to compute requests for hvac service over various future time windows. these requests are expressed in terms of the heating/cooling service required which we can conceptually regard as tokens. a central scheduler balances token requests and allocates tokens to each zone for the next time slot. this allocation attempts to minimize total energy consumption while respecting operational constraints. zone modules update their local models based on the measured thermal responses resulting from allocated tokens, and re-compute forward token requests. this proposed token based architecture is inspired by medium access control protocols in communication networks. it offers several advantages in the context of hvac systems. the architecture is scalable to realistic buildings with 200-500 thermal zones, it is robust relative to non-stationary environmental conditions and unanticipated changes in user needs, and it is modular enabling low-cost deployment without requiring expensive custom thermal modeling of buildings. we develop the zone module algorithms for computing token requests and central scheduler algorithms to allocate tokens. using simulation studies, we demonstrate that the performance loss of our token based scheduling strategy is modest in comparison to a fully centralized nonlinear optimal control scheme. this paper provides an overview of research related to use of building thermal mass for shifting and reducing peak cooling loads in commercial buildings. the paper presents background on the concept and the problem of optimizing zone temperature setpoints and provides specific results that have been obtained through simulations, controlled laboratory testing, and field studies. the studies have demonstrated significant savings potential for use of building thermal mass in commercial buildings. however, the savings are sensitive to many factors, including utility rates, type of equipment, occupancy schedule, building construction, climate conditions, and control strategy. the paper also attempts to provide an assessment of the state of the art in load control using building thermal mass and to identify the steps necessary to achieve widespread application of appropriate control strategies.
purposeosteogenesis imperfecta (oi) has not been studied in a vietnamese population before. the aim of this study was to systematically collect epidemiological information, investigate clinical features and create a clinical database of oi patients in vietnam for future research and treatment strategy development.methodparticipants underwent clinical and physical examinations; also medical records were reviewed. genealogical information was collected and family members’ phenotypical manifestations recorded. cases were classified according to the sillence classification.resultsin total, 146 oi patients from 120 families were studied: 46 with oi type i, 46 with type iii and 54 with type iv. almost patients had skeletal deformations. one hundred and forty-two had a history of fractures, 117 blue sclera, 89 dentinogenesis imperfecta and 26 hearing loss. the total number of fractures was 1,932. thirty-four patients had intra-uterine fractures and nine had perinatal fractures. surgery was performed 163 times in 58 patients; 100 osteosyntheses and 63 osteotomies. bisphosphonate treatment was used in 37 patients. the number of affected individuals and predominance of severe forms of oi indicate that the disease is under diagnosed in vietnam, especially in cases without a family history or with mild form of oi. deformities appeared in all patients with different severity and localisation, affecting mostly the lower limbs. oi medical and surgical treatment rates are low and in most cases surgery was performed due to fractures.conclusionscompared to previous studies, our results indicate a lower oi prevalence and greater severity of symptoms in the vietnamese population when compared with other areas. further investigation, improved diagnosis and treatment are needed to increase the patients’ quality of life. osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is the most common of the inherited connective tissue disorders that primarily affect bone. however, it is a systemic disorder, as evidenced by the occurrence of ocular complications, dentinogenesis imperfecta, hearing loss, joint laxity, restrictive pulmonary disease, and short stature. the oi classification initially included four phenotypes (i–iv) involving col1a1 and col1a2 mutations. three new phenotypes have been added, of which one, type vii, is the result of mutations of the cartilage-associated protein (crtap) gene. investigation of recessive forms of oi particularly reported among south african blacks have revealed mutations involving both the crtap gene and the leucine proline-enriched proteoglycan 1 (lepre1) gene, each involved in collagen proline-3 hydroxylation. issues related to the treatment of oi with bisphosphonates involve patient selection, evaluation of the results of treatment, and the duration of treatment. also, questions exist regarding the difference in treatment response between children and adults with oi. other treatment options, such as recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1–34), rank ligand inhibitors, and stem cell technology, are being evaluated or are of future investigative interest.
we introduce an infinite class of polynomial sequences $a_t(n;z)$ with integer parameter $t\geq 1$, which reduce to the well-known stern (diatomic) sequence when $z=1$ and are $(0,1)$-polynomials when $t\geq 2$. using these polynomial sequences, we derive two different characterizations of all hyperbinary expansions of an integer $n\geq 1$. furthermore, we study the polynomials $a_t(n;z)$ as objects in their own right, obtaining a generating function and some consequences. we also prove results on the structure of these sequences, and determine expressions for the degrees of the polynomials. we define a q-analogue of the calkin-wilf tree and the calkin-wilf sequence. we show that the nth term f(n;q) of the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf sequence is the generating function for the number of hyperbinary expansions of n according to the number of powers that are used exactly twice. we also present formulae for branches within the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf tree and predecessors and successors of terms in the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf sequence.
osteoporosis is a multifactorial skeletal pathology with a main genetic component. to date, however, the majority of genes associated with this pathology remain unknown since genes cataloged to date only explain a part of the heritability of bone phenotypes. in the present study, we have used a genome-wide gene expression approach by means of microarrays to identify new candidate genes involved in the physiopathology of osteoporosis, using as a model the ovariectomized (ovx) mice by comparing global bone marrow gene expression of the ovx mice with those of sham operated mice. one hundred and eighty transcripts were found to be differentially expressed between groups. the analysis showed 23 significant regulatory networks, of which the top five canonical pathways included b-cell development, primary immunodeficiency signaling, pi3k signaling in b-cells, phospholipase c signaling, and fcgriib signaling in b-cells. twelve differentially expressed genes were validated by maldi-tof mass spectrometry with good reproducibility. finally, the association to bone phenotypes of snps in genes whose expression was increased (il7r and cd79a) or decreased (gpx3 and irak3) by ovx in mice was analyzed in a cohort of 706 postmenopausal women. we detected an association of a snp in a gene involved in the detoxification of free radicals like glutathione peroxidase 3 (gpx3) with femoral neck bmd (rs8177447, p=0.043) and two snps in the ig-alpha protein of the b-cell antigen component gene (cd79a) with lumbar spine bmd (rs3810153 and rs1428922, p=0.016 and p=0.001, respectively). these results reinforce the role of antioxidant pathways and of b-cells in bone metabolism. furthermore, it shows that a genome-wide gene expression approach in animal models is a useful method for detecting genes associated to bmd and osteoporosis risk in humans. estrogen deficiency caused by ovariectomy (ovx) results in a marked bone loss due to stimulated bone resorption by osteoclasts. during our investigations of the pathogenesis of bone loss in estrogen deficiency, we found that ovx selectively stimulates b-lymphopoiesis which results in marked accumulation of b220-positive pre-b cells in mouse bone marrow. to examine the possible correlation between stimulated b-lymphopoiesis and bone loss, 8-week-old female mice were treated with interleukin (il) 7, which stimulates b-lymphopoiesis in bone marrow. we also examined bone mass in il-7 receptor-knockout mice that exhibit marked suppression of b-lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow. the increased b-lymphopoiesis induced by il-7 administration resulted in marked bone loss by stimulation of osteoclastic bone resorption in mice with intact ovarian function. the changes in both b-lymphopoiesis and bone mass in il-7-treated female mice were similar to those in age-matched ovx mice. in contrast, the trabecular bone volume of the femur was greatly increased in both female and male il-7 receptor-knockout mice when compared with the respective wild-type and heterozygous littermates. these results show that the perturbation of b-lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow is closely linked to the change in bone mass. we propose here that the increased b-lymphopoiesis due to estrogen deficiency is involved in the mechanism of stimulated bone resorption.
background cross-leg flaps are a good choice for reconstructing traumatized lower extremities, especially when free flaps cannot be used. in this article, we present our experience in the treatment of traumatic lower extremity wounds by using cross-leg flaps.   study design a total of 56 patients suffering traumatic lower extremities were treated with cross-leg flaps. patients with diabetes mellitus and those who were heavy smokers were also included in this study.   results most flaps survived without complications. flap necrosis occurred in 2 cases. the hospital stay was 20.0 ± 6.2 days and the flaps were divided at 13.3 ± 2.8 days. the diabetes patients were mostly elderly, and they had longer hospital stays and duration for flap division. follow-up was an average of 16.2 ± 8.2 months.   conclusions the cross-leg flap is an effective and simple method for treating traumatic lower extremity wounds. it should have priority over microsurgery, not just be an alternative to it. background: microvascular free flap anastomoses performed for lower extremity reconstruction are traditionally proximal to the zone of injury. the authors assessed the feasibility and outcomes of microvascular free flaps with anastomoses performed distal to the zone of injury. methods: the authors retrospectively reviewed all microvascular free flaps performed at their institution over the past 10 years for lower extremity reconstruction and compared this group with their previously published experience (january of 1979 through august of 1995). between september of 1995 and may of 2005, 119 flap procedures were performed for lower extremity reconstruction. twenty-eight flaps (24 percent) were anastomosed distal to the zone of injury and 87 (76 percent) were anastomosed proximally. there were insufficient data on the location of the anastomosis for four free flaps (all successful). results: twenty-seven of 28 distal microvascular free flaps were successful (96 percent); two (7 percent) required emergent postoperative reexploration of the anastomosis. of the 87 proximal flaps, 79 (91 percent) were successful and eight (9 percent) failed. there was no statistically significant difference in the success rate of microvascular free flaps between the proximal and distal anastomosis groups (p = 0.30, fisher’s exact test). combined with the data from the authors’ previous series (january of 1979 to august of 1995), there were 63 free flaps with anastomosis performed distal to the zone of injury; 61 (97 percent) were successful. conclusion: the authors’ extensive 25-year experience with lower extremity reconstruction demonstrates that in appropriately selected patients, free tissue transfer to recipient vessels distal to the zone of injury is reliable and in certain cases preferable.
a full-length cdna encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase (designated as bt2hmgr) and its genomic sequence were cloned and characterized from an endophytic taxol-producing fungus bt2 for the first time. the full-length cdna of bt2hmgr was 4,078 bp with an open reading frame of 3,522 bp encoding an 1,173-amino-acid polypeptide. the comparison analysis between cdna and genomic dna sequence revealed that bt2hmgr gene had four exons and three introns. bioinformatic analyses revealed that the deduced bt2hmgr contained six transmembrane domains and a catalytic domain, and showed high similarity to other fungal hmgrs. southern blot analysis indicated that bt2hmgr was a single copy gene. rt-pcr analysis indicated that the expression of bt2hmgr could be induced by methyl jasmonate acid. the cloning and characterization of bt2hmgr will enable us to further understand the role of bt2hmgr in the taxol biosynthetic pathway in an endophytic taxol-producing fungus. taxus cell culture may be an alternative source of paclitaxel and related taxane production. significantly increased amounts of paclitaxel and baccatin iii were observed in cultured cells of taxus species after exposure to methyl jasmonate. among the three species of taxus tested, taxus media showed the highest paclitaxel content while taxus baccata showed the highest baccatin iii content when 100 μm of methyl jasmonate was added to the culture media. furthermore, the activities of methyl jasmonate and related substances for inducing paclitaxel production were compared in cell suspension cultures of t. media. methyl jasmonate and its free acid showed the strongest promoting activity. reduction of the keto group at the c-3 position greatly reduced this activity. cis-jasmone, which does not have a carboxyl group at the c-1 position, had almost no activity. these results suggest that these two regions of methyl jasmonate are important for promoting the production of paclitaxel and related taxanes in taxus cell cultures.
spawning female blue crabs, callinectes sapidus, use ebb-tide transport (ett) to migrate seaward. in estuaries with semi-diurnal tides, ett in ovigerous blue crabs is driven by a circatidal rhythm in vertical swimming in which crabs ascend into the water column during ebb tide. the ontogeny of this rhythm was examined by monitoring swimming behavior of females before the pubertal molt, females that had recently undergone the molt but had not yet produced a clutch of eggs, and ovigerous females from an estuary with strong semi-diurnal tides. to assess variation in swimming rhythms with ambient tidal regime, swimming rhythms of ovigerous females from semi-diurnal (beaufort, north carolina), diurnal (st. andrew bay, florida), and non-tidal (south river, north carolina) estuaries were compared. experiments were conducted during the summers of 2006–2008. female crabs prior to oviposition had variable endogenous swimming rhythms (circadian, circatidal, or circalunidian). ovigerous females from estuaries with semi-diurnal and diurnal tides had pronounced circatidal or circalunidian rhythms with swimming during the time of ambient ebb tide. swimming rhythms of several ovigerous crabs switched between circatidal and circalunidian during the ~5-day observation period. ovigerous crabs from a non-tidal estuary had a circadian rhythm with vertical swimming around the time of sunset. these results suggest that, while endogenous swimming rhythms are present in some female blue crabs prior to oviposition, rapid seaward movement via ett in tidal estuaries begins following oviposition of the first clutch of eggs. abstract ovigerous blue crabs, callinectes sapidus rathbun, undergo ebb-tide transport (ett) during the spawning migration from estuaries to coastal areas where they release larvae. an initial field study found that only females with mature embryos underwent the spawning migration and that postspawned females switched to flood-tide transport for movement back into and up estuaries. alternatively, a more recent field study found ett occurred in females throughout embryo development and continued after larval release. an endogenous rhythm in vertical migration underlies ett during the spawning migration. a past study found the circatidal rhythm was only present in females with mature embryos but not in females with immature embryos or after larval release. the present study reinvestigates this rhythm in vertical migration. both females with early embryos and postlarval release females entrained in the field have circatidal rhythms, in which they swim vertically at the time of consecutive ebb tides at the collection site or on alternate ebb tides. these results support the field study that ovigerous females undergo ett throughout embryo development and after larval release. thus, females will be transported seaward and release subsequent larval clutches in coastal areas that increase the likelihood that larvae will be transported to offshore developmental areas.
the effect of exposure to an original or common idea on crowdsourced idea generation was studied by asking crowd workers to design a public service advertisement. as compared to having no idea exposure, exposure to an original idea decreased fluency and increased the average originality of ideas generated by each person. by contrast, exposure to a common idea had no effect on either idea originality or fluency. however, the two exposure conditions showed no significant difference in either fluency or idea originality. the semantic similarity between a stimulus idea and the first idea generated was higher when the stimulus was common, as opposed to original, as measured by latent semantic analysis. the implications of these results for research and practice are discussed. this brainstorming experiment assessed the extent to which idea exposure produced cognitive stimulation and social comparison effects. one hundred and sixty participants were exposed to either a high or low number of common or unique ideas. the participants likelihood of engaging in social comparison processes (high or low) was also manipulated through instructional sets. the results indicated both cognitive stimulation and social comparison effects. exposure to a high number of ideas and to common ideas enhanced the generation of additional ideas. the effects of exposure to a high number of ideas was greater under high than under low social comparison conditions. finally, recall of exposed ideas was related to enhanced idea generation. these results are consistent with the social/cognitive influence model of group brainstorming (paulus, dugosh, dzindolet, putman, & coskun, 2002). 2004 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
sanitation is of crucial importance for the microbiological safety of drinking water. however, chlorination of water rich in organic material produces disinfection by-products (dbps), many of which have been reported to be mutagenic and/or carcinogenic compounds such as haloacetic acids and trihalomethanes. epidemiological studies have suggested a link between drinking water consumption and cancer. we previously observed that cyprinus carpio fish exposed to dbps, may be subject to epigenetic effects such as those referable to the up-regulation of cytochrome p450 (cyp) superfamily (ex. co-mutagenesis/co-carcinogenesis and oxidative stress) that has been associated to non-genotoxic carcinogenesis. our goal was to study the xenobiotic metabolism in mollusks exposed in situ to surface water of lake trasimene (central italy) treated with several disinfectants such as the traditional chlorine dioxide (clo2), sodium hypochlorite (naclo) or the relatively new one peracetic acid (paa). the freshwater bivalves (dreissena polymorpha) being selected as biomarker, have the unique ability to accumulate pollutants. freshwater bivalves were maintained in surface water containing each disinfectant individually (1-2 mg/l). following an exposure period up to 20 days during the fall period, microsomes were collected from the mussels, then tested for various monooxygenases. strong cyp inductions were observed. these data indicate that drinking water disinfection generates harmful dbp mixtures capable of determining a marked perturbation of cyp-supported reactions. this phenomenon, being associated to an increased pro-carcinogen bioactivation and persistent oxidative stress, could provide an explanation for the observational studies connecting the regular consumption of drinking water to increased risk of various cancers in humans. trihalomethanes (chloroform, bromoform, bromodichlo-romethane, and chlorodibromomethane) are common contaminants of chlorinated drinking water. although animal data indicate that these compounds may be reproductive toxicants, little information exists on their relation to spontaneous abortion in humans. we examined exposure to trihalomethanes and spontaneous abortion in a prospective study of 5,144 pregnant women in a prepaid health plan. seventy-eight drinking water utilities provided concurrent trihalomethane sampling data. we calculated total trihalomethane levels by averaging all measurements taken by the subject's utility during her first trimester. we calculated exposures to individual trihalomethanes in an analogous manner. women who drank ≥5 glasses per day of cold tapwater containing ≥75 μg per liter total trihalomethanes had an adjusted odds ratio (or) of 1.8 for spontaneous abortion [95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.1–3.0]. of the four individual trihalomethanes, only high bromodichloromethane exposure (consumption of ≥5 glasses per day of cold tapwater containing ≥18 μg per liter bromodichloromethane) was associated with spontaneous abortion both alone (adjusted or = 2.0; 95% cl = 1.2–3.5) and after adjustment for the other trihalomethanes (adjusted or = 3.0; 95% ci = 1.4–6.6).
several features of bird basilar papilla morphology were quantitatively studied in the starling and the pigeon in order to attempt a structure-function correlation. we confirmed and quantified several findings from earlier studies, but also obtained results contradictory to previous reports. the greatest discrepancies concerned the pattern of hair cell orientation. by including the results from other investigations, we describe a 'typical' avian basilar papilla and on this basis the specializations within individual species. these morphological specializations are discussed in the context of the available physiological data. the basilar papilla of the barn owl's (tyto alba) cochlea was found to be 9.5-11.5 mm long. histological examination revealed that the sensory hair cells had a characteristic distribution: the proximal half contained mostly typical short cells; tall hair cells were present only on the distal half along with many short cells. lenticular short cells occupied the proximal tip of the papilla. another unusual feature of the proximal part was a dense fibrous mass in the basilar membrane. this was absent from the distal one-fourth.
abstract background the fontan circulation is the optimal treatment for patients with univentricular hearts. these patients are at high risk of circulatory failure. there is no consensus on the optimal drug treatment for the prevention of failure of the fontan circulation. the aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview of evidence for drug therapy used in the prevention of fontan circulatory failure. methods we searched the embase database for articles that reported drug therapy in fontan patients. studies published between 1997 and 2014 were included if efficacy or safety of medication was assessed, drug therapy aimed to prevent or treat failure of the fontan circulation, and if the full text was available. case reports were excluded. results a total of nine studies were included with a total of 267 fontan patients; four studies evaluated the medication sildenafil, one iloprost, three bosentan, and one enalapril. among all, two sildenafil studies reported improvement in exercise capacity, one in exercise haemodynamics, and one in ventricular performance. in the largest study of bosentan, an increase in exercise capacity was found. enalapril did not result in improvements. conclusion the studies analysed in this review suggest that bosentan, sildenafil, and iloprost may improve exercise capacity at the short term. given the limitations of the studies, more, larger, placebo-controlled studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to better understand which drug therapies are effective in the prevention of failure of the fontan circulation. objectivea single dose of sildenafil improves exercise capacity in fontan patients. however, a recent study failed to show a long-term effect of sildenafil. this study evaluated whether there are factors that might predict sildenafil effects.methodswe studied 36 patients (16–42 years, 14 female) with univentricular heart after various modifications of the fontan surgery (13 apc, 16 avc, 7 tcpc). they performed two cardiopulmonary exercise tests, with at least 120 min rest and a single dose of 50 mg sildenafil in between.resultsafter sildenafil administration, patients improved their peak oxygen uptake from 64.5 to 67.3 % predicted (p = 0.0003) without change in ventilatory efficiency ($${\dot{\text{v}}}_{\text{e}} /{\dot{\text{v}}\text{co}}_{2}$$v˙e/v˙co2 slope), oxygen saturation (spo2) at rest or at peak exercise, respiratory exchange ratio. in addition, resting systolic blood pressure was slightly reduced after sildenafil administration. there was a moderate negative correlation of this improvement to baseline peak oxygen uptake (r = −0.395; p = 0.017). the change in peak oxygen uptake could not be correlated to time of surgery, type of surgery, nt-pro-bnp, or to other clinical data. nevertheless, all four patients with nt-pro-bnp levels higher than 1,000 pg/ml had the most prominent improvements in exercise capacity.conclusionsfontan patients have an improved exercise capacity after a single dose of sildenafil. patients with worse baseline peak oxygen uptake profit more.
backgrounddependence on antipsycotic drugs like aripriprazole (ari) is increasing at alarming rate, hence, this study was undertaken to support the hypothesis that supplementation of citrus paradisi(grapefruit) juice having high concentration of polyphenols might potentiate and synergize the therapeutic effect of ari, by increasing its bioavailability and inherent antioxidant potential. these benefits together might decrease the daily dosage of the ari and thus alleviate the possible side effects of drug.methodsin this study the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of ari alone and in combination with gfj was evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) induced oxidative stress in mice. seventy mice (4 weeks old), were randomly divided into seven groups. group i: control; group ii: h2o2 treated; group iii; ari treated; group iv gfj treated; group v: gfj and h2o2 treated; group vi; ari and h2o2 treated; group vii; ari, gfj and h2o2 treated. serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (alt), blood urea nitrogen (bun), creatinine kinase (ck), creatinine and total protein were measured. furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (il)-1α, il-2, il-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α) concentrations were also measured.resultsthe mice group that was treated with ari, gfj or combination of the two showed significant improvement in the h2o2 altered parameters with the combination group showing more significant improvement than the ari and gfj alone groups indicating a synergistic and potentiating effect of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of gfj on ari.conclusionsupplementing gfj to ari might increase an anti-oxidative potential of ari due to inherent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of gfj and thus could alleviate the possible dosage dependent side effects of ari. abstract obesity has been associated with a marked risk of metabolic diseases and requires therapeutic strategies. changes in redox status with increased oxidative stress in adipose tissue have been linked with obesity-related disorders. thus, the biological effect of antioxidants such as polyphenols is of high interest. we aimed to measure antioxidant capacities of 28 polyphenols representative of main dietary phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes and curcuminoids. then, 14 molecules were selected for the evaluation of their effect on 3t3-l1 preadipocytes and human red blood cells exposed to oxidative stress. analysis of reducing and free radical-scavenging capacities of compounds revealed antioxidant properties related to their structure, with higher activities for flavonoids such as quercetin and epicatechin. their effects on preadipocytes’ viability also depended on their structure, dose and time of exposure. interestingly, most of the compounds exhibited a protective effect on preadipocytes exposed to oxidative stress, by reversing h2o2-induced anti-proliferative action and reactive oxygen species production. polyphenols also exerted an anti-inflammatory effect on preadipocytes exposed to h2o2 by reducing il-6 secretion. importantly, such antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects were observed in co-exposition (polyphenol and prooxidant during 24 h) or pretreatment (polyphenol during 24 h, then prooxidant for 24 h) conditions. moreover, compounds protected erythrocytes from aaph radical-induced lysis. finally, these results led to demonstrate that antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of polyphenols may depend on structure, dose, time of exposure and cell conditioning with oxidative stress. such findings should be considered for a better understanding of polyphenols’ benefits in strategies aiming to prevent obesity-related diseases.
objective: diabetes mellitus type 2 is one of the most widespread chronic metabolic diseases. in most cases, this type of diabetes is associated with alterations in levels of some inflammatory cytokines and hormones. considering anti-inflammatory properties of plant extracts rich in ascorbic acid (vitamin c) and alpha-tocopherol (vitamin e), anti-diabetic properties of these two well-known antioxidant vitamins were investigated through measurement of serum levels of high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp), insulin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α), and serum amyloid a (saa) in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. materials and methods: male patients (n=80) were randomly divided into two groups each consisted of 40 subjects. test groups were supplemented with ascorbic acid (1000 mg/day) or alpha-tocopherol (300 mg/day) orally during four weeks. before and after treatment, serum biochemical factors of subjects were measured and compared. results: our results showed that both ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol could induce significant anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing the level of inflammatory factors such as tnf-α, saa, and hs-crp in diabetes mellitus type 2 patients. effects of alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid in decreasing serum leptin level were similar. ascorbic acid in contrast to alpha-tocopherol diminished fasting insulin and homa index but had no effect on ldl serum level. conclusion: concerning the obtained results, it is concluded that consumption of supplementary vitamins c and e could decrease induced inflammatory response in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. it is also possible that vitamin c and vitamin e supplementation can attenuate incidence of some proposed pathological effects of diabetes mellitus. we prospectively examined the relationship between leptin and markers of insulin resistance and secretion and future visceral adipose tissue accumulation. in this study, 518 nondiabetic japanese-american men and women underwent the following measurements at baseline and at 5- and 10-year follow-ups: plasma glucose and insulin measured after an overnight fast and during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, insulin secretion ratio (isr) [(30-min insulin - fasting insulin)/30-min glucose], fasting c-peptide levels, plasma leptin (baseline only), and fat areas (intra-abdominal and subcutaneous) measured by computed tomography. predictors of future intra-abdominal fat (iaf) were determined using multiple linear regression. fasting insulin and c-peptide levels at baseline were significantly associated with iaf area at 5 years (coefficient = 0.041, p = 0.001 and coefficient = 1.283, p < 0.001, respectively) and 10 years (coefficient = 0.031, p = 0.020 and coefficient = 0.221, p = 0.035, respectively). isr was not significantly associated with iaf at 5 or 10 years. leptin level at baseline was positively associated with iaf at 5 years (coefficient = 0.055, p = 0.002) and 10 years (coefficient = 0.059, p = 0.003). in conclusion, higher levels of fasting insulin, c-peptide, and circulating leptin level predicted visceral fat accumulation independent from subcutaneous fat accumulation in nondiabetic japanese-american men and women in both short-term (5 years) and long-term (10 years) follow-up.
background recent experimental and clinical studies have indicated that the β-adrenergic effect of epinephrine significantly increases the severity of post resuscitation myocardial dysfunction. the aim of the study was to investigate whether the short-acting β1-selective adrenergic blocking agent, esmolol, would attenuate post resuscitation myocardial dysfunction in a porcine model of cardiac arrest. methods and results after 8 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation and 2 min of basic life support, 24 pigs were randomized to three groups (n = 8 per group), which received central venous injection of either epinephrine combined with esmolol (ee group), epinephrine (ep group), or saline (sa group). hemodynamic status and blood samples were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 360 min after return of spontaneous circulation (rosc). surviving pigs were euthanatized at 24 h after rosc, and the hearts were removed for analysis by electron microscopy, western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dutp nick end labeling (tunel) assay. compared with the ep and sa groups, ee group had a better outcome in hemodynamic function, (improved dp/dt maxima and minima and cardiac output) (p<0.05), and improved oxygen metabolism (oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption) (p<0.05), which suggesting that ee can protect myocardial tissue from injury and improve post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction. the protective effect of ee also correlated with reducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis, evidenced by reducing tunel-positive cells, increasing anti-apoptotic bcl-2/bax ratio and suppression of caspase-3 activity in myocardium. conclusions esmolol, a short-acting β1-selective adrenergic blocking agent, given during cpr has significant effects on attenuating post resuscitation myocardial dysfunction. the current study provides a potential pharmacologic target for post resuscitation myocardial dysfunction. apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an active metabolic response to physiological signals or exposure to cytotoxic agents. recent evidence has shown that the cell death response can be modified by agents presumed to be unrelated to the initial signal, but capable of interfering with the molecular mechanisms of the apoptotic pathway progression. here we show the results of investigations on the use of a phospholipid-based pharmaceutical preparation for suppression of myocardial damage. first, we show that serum or serum/glucose deprivation, in vitro ischemia with subsequent simulated reperfusion, inhibition of protein synthesis, and treatment with ceramide, staurosporine, adriamycin, cis-platinum and menadione induce apoptotic death in a primary culture of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. then we demonstrate that a mixture of specific phospholipids, which has been originally purified from soy flour on the basis of its anti-apoptotic activity, prevents cardiomyocyte death induced by serum or serum/glucose deprivation, by ischemia with subsequent simulated reperfusion, and by ceramide, but not by other cytotoxic treatments. this suggests that ceramide, a lipid secondary messenger which triggers apoptosis induced by some cytotoxic agents, may be involved in the process of signaling ischemia/reperfusion induced apoptotic death of cardiomyocytes. these results further demonstrate that an active pharmaceutical preparation for the suppression of cardiomyocyte death can be formulated based upon a novel strategy of apoptosis modification.
abstract. the tat protein-export system serves to translocate folded proteins, often containing redox cofactors, across the bacterial inner membrane. substrate proteins are directed to the tat apparatus by distinctive n-terminal signal peptides containing a consensus srrxflk 'twin-arginine' motif. here we review recent studies of the tat system with particular emphasis on the assembly of membrane-bound respiratory complexes. we discuss the connection between tat targeting and topological organisation of the complexes and consider the role of chaperone proteins in cofactor insertion and tat targeting. the crystal structure of escherichia coli formate dehydrogenase-n demonstrates that some tat substrates are integral membrane proteins. sequence analysis suggests that one-quarter of all traffic on the e. coli tat pathway is inner-membrane proteins. protein translocation across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane has been studied extensively in escherichia coli. the identification of the components involved and subsequent reconstitution of the purified translocation reaction have defined the minimal constituents that allowed extensive biochemical characterization of the so‐called translocase. this functional enzyme complex consists of the secyeg integral membrane protein complex and a peripherally bound atpase, seca. under translocation conditions, four secyeg heterotrimers assemble into one large protein complex, forming a putative protein‐conducting channel. this tetrameric arrangement of secyeg complexes and the highly dynamic seca dimer together form a proton‐motive force‐ and atp‐driven molecular machine that drives the stepwise translocation of targeted polypeptides across the cytoplasmic membrane. recent findings concerning the translocase structure and mechanism of protein translocation are discussed and shine new light on controversies in the field.
reactive oxygen species (ros) and reactive nitrogen species (rns) direct the activation of distinct signaling pathways that determine cell fate. in this study, the pathways activated and the mechanisms by which ros and rns control the viability of pancreatic β-cells were examined. although both nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide (h₂o₂) induce dna damage, reduce cell viability, and activate ampk, the mechanisms of ampk activation and cell death induction differ between each reactive species. nitric oxide activates the unfolded protein and heat shock responses and mapk kinase signaling, whereas h₂o₂ stimulates p53 stabilization and poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) activation but fails to induce the unfolded protein or heat shock responses or mapk activation. the control of cell fate decisions is selective for the form of stress. h₂o₂-mediated reduction in β-cell viability is controlled by parp, whereas cell death in response to nitric oxide is parp independent but associated with the nuclear localization of gapdh. these findings show that both ros and rns activate ampk, induce dna damage, and reduce cell viability; however, the pathways controlling the responses of β-cells are selective for the type of reactive species. apoptotic and necrotic cell death are well characterized and are influenced by intracellular atp levels. poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp), a nuclear enzyme activated by dna strand breaks, physiologically participates in dna repair. overactivation of parp after cellular insults can lead to cell death caused by depletion of the enzyme's substrate beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and of atp. in this study, we have differentially elicited apoptosis or necrosis in mouse fibroblasts. fibroblasts from parp-deficient (parp(-/-)) mice are protected from necrotic cell death and atp depletion but not from apoptotic death. these findings, together with cell death patterns in parp(-/-) animals receiving other types of insults, indicate that parp activation is an active trigger of necrosis, whereas other mechanisms mediate apoptosis.
inclusion of plant protein sources such as soyabean meal (sbm) in aquafeeds is associated with decreased lipid digestibility, reduced bile acid levels and hypocholesterolaemia. the mechanism for these metabolic abnormalities is unknown. the present study aimed at gaining further insight into how cholesterol and bile acid metabolism is modulated by sbm feeding by quantifying a number of mrna species corresponding to key proteins involved in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism using quantitative real-time pcr. a 21 d feeding trial with sequential sampling at ten time points following initiation of 20% sbm exposure was conducted on atlantic salmon. a histological evaluation confirmed distal intestinal enteritis after 5 d of dietary exposure to the sbm, whereas diminished glycogen/lipid deposition was the only relevant finding observed in the liver. sbm inclusion resulted in reduced body pools of cholesterol and bile acids. hepatic gene expression profiles revealed up-regulation of genes encoding rate-limiting enzymes in cholesterol (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coa reductase; hmgcr) and bile acid (cytochrome p4507a1 (cyp7a1)) biosynthesis, as well as up-regulation of their associated transcription factors (sterol regulatory element binding proteins 1 and 2, liver x receptor, farnesoid x receptor and ppar isoforms). hepatic gene expressions of cholesterol (atp binding cassette g5 (abcg5)) and bile acid (atp binding cassette b11 (abcb11)) transporters were, by and large, not influenced by the sbm, but distal intestinal expression patterns of abcg5 and apical na-dependent bile acid transporter indicated impaired cholesterol and bile acid reabsorption. in conclusion, hepatic gene expression profiles indicated that the capacity for cholesterol and bile acid synthesis was up-regulated, whereas the indicated impaired cholesterol and bile acid reabsorption probably occurred as a direct result of distal intestinal inflammation. the regulatory control mechanisms of lipid and fatty acid metabolism were investigated in atlantic salmon. we identified sterol regulatory element binding protein (srebp) genes in salmon and characterised their response, and the response of potential target and other regulatory genes including liver x receptor (lxr), to cholesterol and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (lc-pufa) in the salmon established cell line, shk-1. two cdnas for srebps homologous to mammalian srebp-1 and srebp-2 were characterised. we identified three groups of genes whose expression responded differently to the treatments. one group of genes, including cholesterol biosynthetic genes, showed increased expression in response to lipid depletion but supplementary cholesterol or lc-pufa had no further effect. the expression of a second group of genes belonging to fatty acid biosynthetic pathways, included fatty acid synthase, δ6 and δ5 fatty acyl desaturases, also increased after lipid depletion but this was negated by cholesterol or by lc-pufa supplementation. the expression of a third group of genes including acyl-coa oxidase, hmg-coa reductase and elovl5 elongase was increased by cholesterol treatment but was not affected by lipid depletion or by lc-pufa. this same pattern of expression was also shown by liver x receptor (lxr), indicating that acyl-coa oxidase, hmg-coa reductase and elovl5 are possible direct targets of lxr. this suggests that salmon elovl5 may be regulated differently from mammalian elovl5, which is an indirect target of lxr, responding to lxr-dependent increases in srebp-1.
backgroundpoint-of-choice prompts consistently increase stair climbing; a greater increase in overweight than normal weight individuals was reported in a multi-component worksite campaign.purposethe purpose of this study is to investigate effects of a multi-component campaign, on stair climbing, in a public access setting.methodsin an interrupted-time-series-design, baseline observations (2 weeks) preceded a 2-week point-of-choice prompt. an additional message, positioned at the top of the climb for a further 6-week period, summarised the calorific consequences of a single ascent. inconspicuous observers recorded traveller's methods of ascent, coded by sex and weight status, twice a week between 08:00 and 09:59.resultsat baseline, the overweight chose stairs less than normal weight individuals. the multi-component campaign targeting weight control reversed this bias, increasing stair climbing only in overweight individuals.conclusionsthe specificity of the effect confirms the appeal of this lifestyle activity for the overweight. the discussion focuses on how intentions to control weight may be converted into behaviour. objectives: there is evidence that poster prompts increase stair use. the present study was concerned with the effects of poster size, poster message, and setting on stair use. design: using a quasi-experimental design, four observational studies were undertaken in which stair and escalator use were logged during 2-week baseline periods and 2-week intervention periods. methods: in the first two studies, observations were undertaken in two shopping centres (total n = 30,018) with the size of poster varying. in the other two studies (total n = 37,907), one in a shopping centre and one in a train station, two poster messages were tested in both sites. results: pedestrian traffic volume was controlled for statistically. there were significant increases in stair use with a1- and a2-, but not a3-size posters. overall, the two different poster messages were both effective in encouraging stair use. interactions between gender and message setting, however, reflected the fact that the 'stay healthy, save time' poster had little impact on female shoppers but was highly effective for female commuters. conclusion: these results suggest that developers of health-promotion posters pay attention to poster size. they also indicate that it is insufficient to segment audiences by gender without considering the setting and motivational context.
summary in cultured mesangial cells (mc), capacitative ca2 + influx via store-operated channels (soc) is potentiated by agents that release ca2 + from intracellular stores, and inhibited by protein kinase c (pkc). cells grown under high glucose conditions, as a model of the diabetic microenvironment, display reduced ca2 + signalling in response to vasoconstrictors, probably due to downregulation by elevated pkc activity. since soc might be relevant to this phenomenon, we assessed ca2 + influx by microfluorometry of fura-2-loaded rat mc cultured for 5 days in normal (5.5 mmol/l, ng) or high glucose (30 mmol/l, hg). the addition of 1–10 mmol/l ca2 + to ng cells equilibrated in ca2 + -free media induced an immediate ca2 + influx with a free cytosolic ca2 + ([ca2 + ]i) plateau of 155 ± 50 and 318 ± 114 nmol/l, respectively. basal influx was reduced to 88 ± 8 and 145 ± 17 nmol/l [ca2 + ]i (1–10 mmol/l ca2 + , p < 0.01) by 30 mmol/l d-glucose. this effect of hg was confirmed by mn2 + quenching of fura-2, indicating reduced entry of divalent cations via the capacitative pathway. equimolar l-glucose had no effect on ca2 + influx, consistent with a non-osmotic mechanism. arginine vasopressin (10 μmol/l) elicited weaker release of stored ca2 + and subsequent influx in hg cells (191 ± 33 vs 153 ± 24 nmol/l, 400 ± 76 vs 260 ± 33 nmol/l, 1–10 mmol/l ca2 + , ng/hg, p < 0.05). to examine the involvement of pkc in the effect of hg on capacitative ca2 + influx, the enzyme was activated or downregulated by treatment with 0.1 μmol/l phorbol myristate acetate (pma) for 3 min or 24 h, respectively. pma acutely inhibited ca2 + influx in ng cells, while pkc downregulation restored it in hg cells. similarly, the pkc inhibitors staurosporin or h-7 normalized soc activity in hg cells. in summary, impairment of ca2 + influx via soc by hg is one mechanism of the reduced mc [ca2 + ]i responsiveness to vasoconstrictors. this event is mediated by pkc and may contribute to the glomerular haemodynamic changes in the initial stages of diabetes mellitus. [diabetologia (1997) 40: 521–527] high extracellular glucose activates protein kinase c (pkc), a family of kinases vital to intracellular signaling. however, which pkc isoforms are involved and where in the cell they operate is unclear. we tested the hypothesis that only those pkc isoforms binding to diacylglycerol (dag) are activated by high glucose. we also reasoned that the isoforms would translocate to different parts of the cell, where they presumably serve different functions. the pkc isoforms alpha, beta, delta, epsilon, and zeta were studied. twenty mm glucose caused an increase in total pkc activity at six hours, which was maintained at 24 hours. high glucose decreased the angiotensin ii-induced calcium signal. this effect was reversed by preincubating the cells with the pkc inhibitor staurosporine. glucose induced a translocation of all pkc isoforms except pkc zeta by western blot. confocal microscopy showed that pkc alpha, beta, and epsilon were translocated into the nucleus. pkc delta showed strong association with cytoskeletal structures. the effects were sustained at 24 hours for pkc isoform beta and to a lesser extent for pkc delta and epsilon, but not for pkc alpha. thus, pkc isoforms differ in their propensity to be activated by high glucose. those isoforms binding to dag are activated. both cytoskeletal and nuclear signaling may be involved.
background pediatric hiv is a major world health problem, which is progressing at an alarming rate. lesions in the mouth and in other tissues and organs (oral and systemic lesions) in pediatric hiv infection are diverse and show differences in clinical presentation and severity from that of adults. very little data exist for oral lesions in pediatric population in india. to assess oral mucosal status of hiv-infected children and to correlate it with their salivary iga levels.   methods the study group consisted of 150 hiv-infected children aged 6-18 years. they were divided into two groups. group 1: children prior to anti-retroviral therapy, group 2: children undergoing anti-retroviral therapy (for not more than 3 years). criteria given by ramos-gomez for diagnosis of oral lesions commonly associated with hiv infection in children were used to record the oral lesions. salivary iga levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. data obtained were subjected to statistical analysis.   results there was a significant difference in mean secretory iga (siga) levels between the groups (p ≤ 0.05). all the children had one or more oral mucosal lesions, with angular cheilitis being the most common lesion. there was a significant inverse relation between siga levels and individual oral mucosal lesions (p ≤ 0.05). the number of oral lesions was inversely related to the siga levels.   conclusion oral mucosal lesions were a significant feature of hiv-infected infection, particularly in children prior to the onset of anti-retroviral therapy. all children showed low siga levels. early recognition and management of oral conditions are important to improve the quality of life in these children. objective conducted a literature review to identify studies that reported on the oral manifestations in human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infected children in highly active antiretrovial therapy (haart) era.   methods a search electronic data base were used and the terms used were 'oral lesions' and 'oral manifestations'. the studies of prevalence of oral manifestation in children with hiv worldwide, descriptive studies, case reports, studies on the association of oral lesions and levels of immune suppression, use of haart and transmission of hiv were included.   results there have been substantial changes in the management of hiv disease, especially in the past decade because of the use of haart. however, children are still being infected and present some peculiarities when compared with adults. molecular epidemiology, transmission and therapy of the common opportunistic oral infections of hiv disease need to be better understood as a consequence of improved anti-hiv strategies. treatment with haart improves the immune function and decreases mortality, morbidity, and opportunistic infections in hiv-infected persons.   conclusion the frequency and severity of oral disease associated with hiv infection have reduced considerably, although the use of haart may be associated with an increased appearance of oral lesions associated with human papillomavirus and potentially increase the risk of later oral squamous cell carcinoma.
as infectious disease surveillance systems expand to include digital, crowd-sourced, and social network data, public health agencies are gaining unprecedented access to high-resolution data and have an opportunity to selectively monitor informative individuals. contact networks, which are the webs of interaction through which diseases spread, determine whether and when individuals become infected, and thus who might serve as early and accurate surveillance sensors. here, we evaluate three strategies for selecting sensors—sampling the most connected, random, and friends of random individuals—in three complex social networks—a simple scale-free network, an empirical venezuelan college student network, and an empirical montreal wireless hotspot usage network. across five different surveillance goals—early and accurate detection of epidemic emergence and peak, and general situational awareness—we find that the optimal choice of sensors depends on the public health goal, the underlying network and the reproduction number of the disease (r0). for diseases with a low r0, the most connected individuals provide the earliest and most accurate information about both the onset and peak of an outbreak. however, identifying network hubs is often impractical, and they can be misleading if monitored for general situational awareness, if the underlying network has significant community structure, or if r0 is high or unknown. taking a theoretical approach, we also derive the optimal surveillance system for early outbreak detection but find that real-world identification of such sensors would be nearly impossible. by contrast, the friends-of-random strategy offers a more practical and robust alternative. it can be readily implemented without prior knowledge of the network, and by identifying sensors with higher than average, but not the highest, epidemiological risk, it provides reasonably early and accurate information. background multiple waves of transmission during infectious disease epidemics represent a major public health challenge, but the ecological and behavioral drivers of epidemic resurgence are poorly understood. in theory, community structure—aggregation into highly intraconnected and loosely interconnected social groups—within human populations may lead to punctuated outbreaks as diseases progress from one community to the next. however, this explanation has been largely overlooked in favor of temporal shifts in environmental conditions and human behavior and because of the difficulties associated with estimating large-scale contact patterns. objective the aim was to characterize naturally arising patterns of human contact that are capable of producing simulated epidemics with multiple wave structures. methods we used an extensive dataset of proximal physical contacts between users of a public wi-fi internet system to evaluate the epidemiological implications of an empirical urban contact network. we characterized the modularity (community structure) of the network and then estimated epidemic dynamics under a percolation-based model of infectious disease spread on the network. we classified simulated epidemics as multiwave using a novel metric and we identified network structures that were critical to the network’s ability to produce multiwave epidemics. results we identified robust community structure in a large, empirical urban contact network from which multiwave epidemics may emerge naturally. this pattern was fueled by a special kind of insularity in which locally popular individuals were not the ones forging contacts with more distant social groups. conclusions our results suggest that ordinary contact patterns can produce multiwave epidemics at the scale of a single urban area without the temporal shifts that are usually assumed to be responsible. understanding the role of community structure in epidemic dynamics allows officials to anticipate epidemic resurgence without having to forecast future changes in hosts, pathogens, or the environment.
parasites with complex life cycles have developed numerous and very diverse adaptations to increase the likelihood of completing this cycle. for example, some parasites can abbreviate their life cycles by skipping the definitive host and reproducing inside their intermediate host. the resulting shorter life cycle is clearly advantageous when definitive hosts are absent or rare. in species where life-cycle abbreviation is facultative, this strategy should be adopted in response to seasonally variable environmental conditions. the hermaphroditic trematode coitocaecum parvum is able to mature precociously (progenesis), and produce eggs by selfing while still inside its amphipod second intermediate host. several environmental factors such as fish definitive host density and water temperature are known to influence the life-history strategy adopted by laboratory raised c. parvum. here we document the seasonal variation of environmental parameters and its association with the proportion of progenetic individuals in a parasite population in its natural environment. we found obvious seasonal patterns in both water temperature and c. parvum host densities. however, despite being temporally variable, the proportion of progenetic c. parvum individuals was not correlated with any single parameter. the results show that c. parvum life-history strategy is not as flexible as previously thought. it is possible that the parasite's natural environment contains so many layers of heterogeneity that c. parvum does not possess the ability to adjust its life-history strategy to accurately match the current conditions. the fundamental question of how complex life cycles—where there is typically more than one host—evolve in host–parasite systems remains largely unexplored. we suggest that complex cycles in helminths without penetrative infective stages evolve by two essentially different processes, depending on where in the cycle a new host is inserted. in ‘upward incorporation’, a new definitive host, typically higher up a food web and which preys on the original definitive host, is added. advantages to the parasite are avoidance of mortality due to the predator, greater body size at maturity and higher fecundity. the original host typically becomes an intermediate host, in which reproduction is suppressed. in ‘downward incorporation’, a new intermediate host is added at a lower trophic level; this reduces mortality and facilitates transmission to the original definitive host. these two processes should also apply in helminths with penetrative infective stages, although the mathematical conditions differ.
background the ccr4-not complex is a key eukaryotic regulator of gene transcription and cytoplasmic mrna degradation. whether this complex also affects aspects of post-transcriptional gene regulation, such as mrna export, remains largely unexplored. human caf1 (hcaf1), a ccr4-not complex member, interacts with and regulates the arginine methyltransferase prmt1, whose targets include rna binding proteins involved in mrna export. however, the functional significance of this regulation is poorly understood. methodology/principal findings here we demonstrate using co-immunoprecipitation approaches that ccr4-not subunits interact with hmt1, the budding yeast ortholog of prmt1. furthermore, using genetic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that ccr4-not physically and functionally interacts with the heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnrnps) nab2 and hrp1, and that the physical association depends on hmt1 methyltransferase activity. using mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation and genetic approaches, we also uncover physical and functional interactions between ccr4-not subunits and components of the nuclear pore complex (npc) and we provide evidence that these interactions impact mrna export. conclusions/significance taken together, our findings suggest that ccr4-not has previously unrealized functional connections to the mrna processing/export pathway that are likely important for its role in gene expression. these results shed further insight into the biological functions of ccr4-not and suggest that this complex is involved in all aspects of mrna biogenesis, from the regulation of transcription to mrna export and turnover. protein arginine methylation is an emergent post-translational modification involved in a growing number of cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, cell signaling, rna processing and dna repair. although protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (prmt1) is the major arginine methyltransferase in mammals, little is known about the regulation of its activity, except for the regulation induced by interaction with the antiproliferative protein btg1 (b-cell translocation gene 1). since the protein hcaf1 (ccr4-associated factor 1) was described to interact with btg1, we investigated a functional link between hcaf1 and prmt1. by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments we demonstrated that endogenous hcaf1 and prmt1 interact in vivo and colocalize in nuclear speckles, a sub-nuclear compartment enriched in small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and splicing factors. in vitro methylation assays indicated that hcaf1 is not a substrate for prmt1-mediated methylation, but it regulates prmt1 activity in a substrate-dependent manner. moreover, small interfering rna (sirna)-mediated silencing of hcaf1 in mcf-7 cells significantly modulates the methylation of endogenous prmt1 substrates. finally, we demonstrated that in vitro and in the cellular context, hcaf1 regulates the methylation of sam68 and histone h4, two prmt1 substrates. since hcaf1 and prmt1 have been involved in the regulation of transcription and rna metabolism, we speculate that hcaf1 and prmt1 could contribute to the crosstalk between transcription and rna processing.
background: a prothrombotic state is associated with the presence and severity of organ damage in hypertensive patients. in these patients, evidence of subclinical carotid functional changes anticipates major cardiovascular events. the aim of this study was to investigate the association of hemostatic markers with carotid artery stiffness in hypertension. materials and methods: in 116 untreated essential hypertensive patients recruited at a referral center in the university of udine, we assessed common carotid artery stiffness by b-mode ultrasonography and measured plasma fibrinogen, d-dimer, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1), and homocysteine by the currently available methods. for statistical reasons, the patients were divided according to the median value of each index of carotid stiffness, and continuous variables were further analyzed by univariate correlation and stepwise multivariate regression analysis. results: pai-1 levels were significantly higher in patients with low coefficient of distensibility (p = 0.018) and high young's elastic modulus (p = 0.012), whereas no association of fibrinogen, d-dimer, and homocysteine levels was observed with carotid coefficient of distensibility, young's elastic modulus, and β-stiffness. on univariate analysis, young's elastic modulus was significantly and positively correlated with pai-1 levels (r = 0.286, p = 0.002), a correlation that on multivariate regression resulted to be independent of other confounders (β = 0.289, p = 0.028). conclusion: an independent association of plasma pai-1 levels with carotid artery stiffness suggests a possible contribution of decreased fibrinolytic activity to the early functional abnormalities of arterial vessels in hypertensive patients. this contribution might be relevant for subsequent development of hypertension-related cardiovascular complications. aim a prothrombotic state is associated with organ damage in hypertensive patients. carotid intima-media thickness (imt) is an early marker of vascular damage that anticipates the development of atherosclerotic plaques. the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between subclinical carotid damage and markers of the prothrombotic state in hypertension.   methods in 258 essential hypertensive patients who were consecutively recruited at a hypertension clinic an ultrasound carotid scan was performed with assessment of the imt and plasma levels of c-reactive protein, fibrinogen, fibrin d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2, homocysteine, and lipoprotein(a) were measured.   results patients with an imt above the median of the distribution (800 µm) were older and had greater bmi, pulse pressure, duration of hypertension, and prevalence of coronary heart disease than patients with an imt below the median. patients with higher imt had also greater levels of c-reactive protein, fibrinogen, fibrin d-dimer, and homocysteine. regression analysis showed a direct relationship of imt with age, waist circumference, pulse pressure, fibrinogen, fibrin d-dimer, and number of cigarettes smoked per day, and an inverse relationship with creatinine clearance. on multivariate analysis, age, pulse pressure, and fibrin d-dimer were independently related with imt.   conclusion in hypertensive patients, subclinical carotid damage is related with evidence of activated coagulation system suggesting a prothrombotic state. this might contribute to the development of hypertensive arterial damage even in the earliest stages.
purposespinal cord injury (sci) in the pediatric population is an infrequent but clinically important disease to scoliosis surgeons. spinal deformity after sci is extremely common and almost uniformly develops in patients being injured before the growth spurt. most treatment paradigms extrapolate management from both the adult literature as well as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis data. since these patient populations are different in many respects, we sought out to investigate the rates of loss of correction over time as well as the factors associated with loss of correction in pediatric patients undergoing pedicle screw fixation for treatment of sci-related scoliosis.methodsall consecutive pediatric patients with spinal cord injury and paralytic scoliosis managed with pedicle screw constructs were identified at a single institution. clinical and radiographic parameters were reviewed and analyzed with specific focus on parameters associated with loss of correction at an average follow-up of 2 years.resultsapproximately 15 % of patients had a loss of correction of greater than 10° of cobb angle. postoperative sagittal imbalance was found to be significantly greater in patients who lost greater than 10° of correction compared to patients who did not lose correction (53.6 ± 39.9 vs 4.3 ± 41.3 mm, p = 0.02).conclusionscorrection of patients with paralytic associated scoliosis should aim for a neutral sagittal balance in order to prevent postoperative loss of correction. further study is needed on this subgroup of patients with scoliosis given the differences in strategies needed to correct and maintain their deformity correction. object pedicle screw fixation has been theorized to provide better correction of scoliotic deformity, but controversy over the benefits of pedicle screw-only constructs remains, and the longer-term impact of pedicle screw fixation as compared with hybrid constructs is unclear. in this study, a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was conducted to determine the longer-term impact of pedicle screw fixation as compared with hybrid constructs in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (ais).   methods the authors retrospectively reviewed a multicenter database of pediatric patients (ages ≤ 18) from 1995 to 2006 and identified 127 patients with lenke type 1-4 ais curves with a minimum 5 years of follow-up. patients were divided into 2 cohorts based on whether they had undergone pedicle screw fixation or fixation with hybrid constructs.   results the mean main thoracic curvature of 56.1° ± 13.0°, which corrected to 14.9° ± 9.3°, translated into a mean correction of 73% (p < 0.01). the curve was 19.4° ± 10.6° at 2-year follow-up and 20.5° ± 10.4° at 5 years. when comparing preoperative parameters between the groups, differences were noted in the magnitude of the main thoracic curve (p = 0.04), flexibility of the main thoracic curve (p = 0.02), coronal balance (p = 0.04), t2-12 kyphosis (p = 0.02), and sex (p = 0.02). the pedicle screw cohort had fewer spinal segments instrumented (p < 0.01), fewer anterior releases performed (p = 0.02), and fewer thoracoplasties performed (p < 0.01). by 5 years of follow-up, significant differences were apparent between the two cohorts with respect to upper thoracic curvature (p = 0.01), t2-12 (p = 0.02) and t5-12 (p = 0.02) kyphosis, lumbar lordosis (p < 0.01), and sagittal balance (p = 0.01).   conclusions although some preoperative differences did exist, outcomes were comparable between hybrid and screw constructs at 2 and 5 years. however, hybrid constructs required more concurrent anterior releases and thoracoplasties to achieve similar results.
the objective of the current study was to examine the pharmacy student care effect on hba1c levels and quality of life (qol) of t2dm patients. for this purpose pharmacy students received an academic course on theoretical and clinical aspects of t2dm management. students carried out a psycho-educational intervention among t2dm patients. t2dm patients (n=135) participated in two projects. within each project a random allocation to intervention group (ig) or control group (cg) was conducted. in the first project, hba1c levels were taken from patients' medical files before the intervention commenced (t1), after half a year (t2) and after one year (t3). in the second project, hba1c levels and qol values were measured pre-intervention (t1) and after one year (t2). in both projects, the results showed that hba1c levels declined at t2 among participants in the ig group only. in the second project, ig patients exhibited improvement on the physical and psychological qol scales compared to no improvement among cg. it was therefore concluded that integrative intervention by pharmacy students decreased hba1c levels and improved aspects of quality of life among t2dm patients. practically, pharmacy students play an important role in bridging the gap between physician recommendations and patients’ optimal metabolic-control, by conducting continuous psycho-educational interventions. objectives the current study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of delivering diabetes education in either a group or individual setting using a consistent, evidence-based curriculum.   research design and methods a total of 170 subjects with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either group (n = 87) or individual (n = 83) educational settings. subjects received education in four sequential sessions delivered at consistent time intervals over a 6-month period. outcomes included changes in knowledge, self-management behaviors, weight, bmi, hba(1c), health-related quality of life, patient attitudes, and medication regimen. changes were assessed at baseline and after the 2-week, 3-month, and 6-month education sessions.   results both educational settings had similar improvements in knowledge, bmi, health-related quality of life, attitudes, and all other measured indicators. hba(1c) decreased from 8.5 +/- 1.8% at baseline to 6.5 +/- 0.8% at 6 months (p < 0.01) in the study population as a whole. subjects assigned to the individual setting had a 1.7 +/- 1.9% reduction in hba(1c) (p < 0.01), whereas subjects assigned to the group setting had a 2.5 +/- 1.8% reduction in hba(1c) (p < 0.01). the difference in hba(1c) improvement was marginally greater in subjects assigned to group education versus individualized education (p = 0.05).   conclusions this study demonstrates that diabetes education delivered in a group setting, when compared with an individual setting, was equally effective at providing equivalent or slightly greater improvements in glycemic control. group diabetes education was similarly effective in delivering key educational components and may allow for more efficient and cost-effective methods in the delivery of diabetes education programs.
how autobiographical memories are represented in the human brain and whether this changes with time are questions central to memory neuroscience. two regions in particular have been consistently implicated, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmpfc) and the hippocampus, although their precise contributions are still contested. the key question in this debate, when reduced to its simplest form, concerns where information about specific autobiographical memories is located. here, we availed ourselves of the opportunity afforded by multivoxel pattern analysis to provide an alternative to conventional neuropsychological and fmri approaches, by detecting representations of individual autobiographical memories in patterns of fmri activity. we examined whether information about specific recent (two weeks old) and remote (10 years old) autobiographical memories was represented in vmpfc and hippocampus, and other medial temporal and neocortical regions. vmpfc contained information about recent and remote autobiographical memories, although remote memories were more readily detected there, indicating that consolidation or a change of some kind had occurred. information about both types of memory was also present in the hippocampus, suggesting it plays a role in the retrieval of vivid autobiographical memories regardless of remoteness. interestingly, we also found that while recent and remote memories were both represented within anterior and posterior hippocampus, the latter nevertheless contained more information about remote memories. thus, like vmpfc, the hippocampus too respected the distinction between recent and remote memories. overall, these findings clarify and extend our view of vmpfc and hippocampus while also informing systems-level consolidation and providing clear targets for future studies. a fundamental question in memory research is how our brains can form enduring memories. in humans, memories of everyday life depend initially on the medial temporal lobe system, including the hippocampus. as these memories mature, they are thought to become increasingly dependent on other brain regions such as the cortex. little is understood about how new memories in the hippocampus are transformed into remote memories in cortical networks. however, recent studies have begun to shed light on how remote memories are organized in the cortex, and the molecular and cellular events that underlie their consolidation.
rats ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia and hypercapnia in fructose feeding and intermittent hypoxia affect you might find this additional info useful... physiology, especially those papers emphasizing adaptive and integrative mechanisms. it is published 12 times a publishes original papers that deal with diverse area of research in applied abstract—hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are closely associated with hypertension in humans and in animal models. gender differences have been found in the development of hypertension in fructose-fed rats. the objectives of the present study were, first, to clarify whether androgens are required in the development of hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension in fructose-fed rats, and second, to determine if cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 are also increased in the arteries of these rats. male rats were gonadectomized or sham-operated and fed a 60% fructose diet beginning at age 7 weeks. blood pressure was measured by a tail-cuff method, and an oral glucose tolerance test was performed to assess insulin sensitivity after 8 weeks of fructose feeding. cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 mrna expression was also assessed in the thoracic aortae and mesenteric arteries. gonadectomy prevented hypertension from developing in the fructose-fed rats, but hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance developed. there was an increase in cyclooxygenase-2 expression in the thoracic aortae and mesenteric arteries of the fructose-fed sham-operated rats while the expression of cyclooxygenase-1 remained unchanged. gonadectomy prevented the mrna overexpression of vascular cyclooxygenase-2 in the fructose-fed rats. these results suggest that the presence of androgens is necessary for the development of fructose-induced hypertension. androgens apparently act as a link between hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance and hypertension in fructose-hypertensive rats. furthermore, an increase in the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 is implicated in the development of hypertension. the mechanisms involved require further study.
prss23 and prss35 are homologous proteases originally identified in mouse ovaries. in the periimplantation mouse uterus, prss23 was highly expressed in the preimplantation gestation day 3.5 (d3.5) uterine luminal epithelium (le). it disappeared from the postimplantation le and reappeared in the stromal compartment next to the myometrium on d6.5. it was undetectable in the embryo from d4.5 to d6.5 but highly expressed in the embryo on d7.5. prss35 became detectable in the uterine stromal compartment surrounding the embryo on d4.5 and shifted towards the mesometrial side of the stromal compartment next to the embryo from d5.5 to d7.5. in the ovariectomized uterus, prss23 was moderately and prss35 was dramatically downregulated by progesterone and 17β-estradiol. based on the expression of prss35 in granulosa cells and corpus luteum of the ovary and the early pregnant uterus, we hypothesized that prss35 might play a role in female reproduction, especially in oocyte development, ovulation, implantation, and decidualization. this hypothesis was tested in prss35(−/−) mice, which proved otherwise. between wild type (wt) and prss35(−/−) mice, superovulation of immature females produced comparable numbers of cumulus-oocyte complexes; there were comparable numbers of implantation sites detected on d4.5 and d7.5; there were no obvious differences in the expression of implantation and decidualization marker genes in d4.5 or d7.5 uteri. comparable mrna expression levels of a few known protease-related genes in the wt and prss35(−/−) d4.5 uteri indicated no compensatory upregulation. comparable litter sizes from wt × wt and prss35 (−/−)× prss35 (−/−) crosses suggested that prss35 gene was unessential for fertility and embryo development. prss35 gene has been linked to cleft lip/palate in humans. however, no obvious such defects were observed in prss35(−/−) mice. this study demonstrates the distinct expression of prss23 and prss35 in the periimplantation uterus and the dispensable role of prss35 in fertility and embryo development. abstract the objective of the present study was to determine how low progesterone (p4) affects the endometrial transcriptome, with specific emphasis on those changes that may impact conceptus elongation. following estrous synchronization and detection (estrus = day 0, n = 40), heifers were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 12) or a low p4 group (n = 28). heifers in the low p4 group had consistently lower p4 concentrations compared to controls (p < 0.05). microarray analysis of endometrial gene expression revealed low p4 altered the expression of 498 differentially expressed genes (degs; 215 up- and 283 down-regulated) on day 7 and 351 degs (272 up- and 79 down-regulated) on day 13. a similar number of temporal changes occurred between day 7 and day 13 in both groups (2212 in heifers with normal p4 compared with 2247 in heifers with low p4); of these degs, 1278 were common to both groups. little overlap in the number of degs affected by high or low p4 was observed across days. comparison of the temporal changes that occur during normal estrous cycle progression (i.e., from day 7 to day 13) to those affected by altered p4 found significant numbers of genes were modulated by elevated (4157) and decreased (809) p4 alone. analysis of selected genes by quantitative real-time pcr and in situ hybridization revealed that expression of mep1b, nid2, and prss23 increased on day 13 compared to day 7 (p < 0.05) and that the magnitude of increase was significantly diminished in heifers with low p4 compared to controls. mep1b predominantly localized to the both the superficial and deep glandular epithelium (ge), nid2 localized to the deep ge, whereas prss23 localized only to the luminal epithelium. in conclusion, we have determined the global changes in the endometrial transcriptome induced by decreasing the output of p4 from the corpus luteum in vivo using a unique animal model. placing these data into context with previous data in which p4 was supplemented or elevated after ovulation, we have identified a panel of genes that are truly regulated in the endometrium by circulating concentrations of p4 in vivo and that likely impact conceptus elongation.
molecular phylogenies based on the small subunit ribosomal rna gene (ssu or 18s ribosomal dna (rdna)) revealed recently the existence of a relatively large and widespread group of eukaryotes, branching at the base of the fungal tree. this group, comprising almost exclusively environmental clones, includes the endoparasitic chytrid rozella as the unique known representative. rozella emerged as the first fungal lineage in molecular phylogenies and as the sister group of the microsporidia. here we report rdna molecular phylogenetic analyses of two endonuclear parasites of free-living naked amoebae having microsporidia-like ultrastructural features but belonging to the rozellids. similar to microsporidia, these endoparasites form unflagellated walled spores and grow inside the host cells as unwalled nonphagotrophic meronts. our endonuclear parasites are microsporidia-like rozellids, for which we propose the name paramicrosporidium, appearing to be the until now lacking morphological missing link between fungi and microsporidia. these features contrast with the recent description of the rozellids as an intermediate wall-less lineage of organisms between protists and true fungi. we thus reconsider the rozellid clade as the most basal fungal lineage, naming it rozellomycota. free-living amoebae (fla) are distributed ubiquitously in aquatic and humid habitats. in addition to the role of a few species as causative agents of meningoencephalitis and keratitis, fla are frequently considered to serve as natural hosts and vehicles of dierent bacteria ± especially those that cause human illness. these intracellularly growing organisms are thus protected against chlorine ± favoring their distribution within potable water systems and sanitary facilities. this important observation was ®rst mentioned by rowbotham (1986) for legionellae and was shown by in vitro investigations for various bacteria, ®nally sustained by recent ®ndings of burgholderia pickettii (michel et al. 1997), chlamydia-like organisms (amann et al. 1997), pseudomonas aeruginosa (michel et al. 1995a), and ehrlichialike organisms (michel et al. 1995b) multiplying as endocytobiotic organisms within amoebae isolated from natural habitats. recently we isolated an obviously eukaryotic microorganism showing intracellular multiplication within vannella cirrifera amoebae isolated from samples obtained from a domestic potable warm-water system. for proof of the prevalence of fla, 100-ml water samples were ®ltered through membrane ®lters (0.45 lm, nitrocellulose). the ®lters were placed upside down onto nn agar plates according to page (1976) and then incubated at 30 °c. the best growth rates of the parasite and host were observed in cocultures with v. miroides on nn agar supplemented with 1% nonspeci®c ocean salt at 30 °c. growth of the amoebae was investigated daily by light microscopy. for electron microscopy examinations, cultures of 5±8 days were prepared according to techniques described previously (michel et al. 1995b). an infection with intracellular microorganisms could be detected within 2 days of incubation in v. cirrifera trophozoites. the culture of host amoebae and their parasites appeared to be problematic because of a rapid growth of parasites (strain kw19) within their hosts, leading to decay of the amoebic culture. on evaluation of the host range among fla, only one strain of v. miroides appeared sensitive for an infection with the parasite, showing the same characteristics as the wildtype strain, the exception being that the growth of the new host amoebae and their parasites stayed in a better balance, thus enabling continuous culture. phase-contrast microscopy revealed early stages of parasites within the caryoplasm of the host amoeba (fig. 1). the fast-growing parasite expanded the nuclear membrane, ®nally occupying the whole cell after the nuclear membrane had torn. within a period of 3±5 days the infection led to decay of the amoeba, resulting in the release of immobile coccoid stages of the parasite measuring 0.8±1.2 lm in diameter into the environment. electron microscopy examinations showed two different stages of the parasite in the amoebae: (1) the coccoid stage within the cytoplasm of the host cell and (2) the growing polymorphic stages within the caryoplasm (fig. 2). the polymorphous stages in the nucleus grow up to a diameter of 6.5 lm, with intracellular vacuoles and compartments being surrounded by double membranes (fig. 3). at the end of the developmental period the parasite dierentiates into numerous coccoid forms, ®nally occupying the whole host cell. these coccoid stages are provided with a thick wall of low electron density. parasitol res (1998) 84: 164±166 ó springer-verlag 1998
chronic hypoxia increases the myocardial resistance to acute ischemia-reperfusion injury by affecting the mitochondrial redox balance. hexokinase (hk) bears a high potential to suppress the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species because of its increased association with mitochondria, thereby inhibiting the membrane permeability transition pore opening and preventing cell death. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of severe intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (7,000 m, 8 h/day, 5 wk) on the function and colocalization of hk isoforms with mitochondria in the left (lv) and right ventricles of rat myocardium. the real-time rt-pcr, western blot, enzyme coupled assay, and quantitative immunofluorescence techniques were used. our results showed significantly elevated expression of hk isoforms (hk1 and hk2) in the hypoxic lv. in addition, intermittent hypoxia increased the total hk activity and the association of hk isoforms with mitochondria in both ventricles. these findings suggest that hk may contribute to the cardioprotective phenotype induced by adaptation to severe intermittent hypobaric hypoxia. brain hexokinase is associated with the outer membrane of mitochondria, and its activity has been implicated in the regulation of atp synthesis and apoptosis. reactive oxygen species (ros) are by-products of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. here we show that the adp produced by hexokinase activity in rat brain mitochondria (mt-hexokinase) controls both membrane potential (δψm) and ros generation. exposing control mitochondria to glucose increased the rate of oxygen consumption and reduced the rate of hydrogen peroxide generation. mitochondrial associated hexokinase activity also regulated δψm, because glucose stabilized low δψm values in state 3. interestingly, the addition of glucose 6-phosphate significantly reduced the time of state 3 persistence, leading to an increase in the δψm and in h2o2 generation. the glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose completely impaired h2o2 formation in state 3-state 4 transition. in sharp contrast, the mt-hexokinase-depleted mitochondria were, in all the above mentioned experiments, insensitive to glucose addition, indicating that the mt-hexokinase activity is pivotal in the homeostasis of the physiological functions of mitochondria. when mt-hexokinase-depleted mitochondria were incubated with exogenous yeast hexokinase, which is not able to bind to mitochondria, the rate of h2o2 generation reached levels similar to those exhibited by control mitochondria only when an excess of 10-fold more enzyme activity was supplemented. hyperglycemia induced in embryonic rat brain cortical neurons increased ros production due to a rise in the intracellular glucose 6-phosphate levels, which were decreased by the inclusion of 2-deoxyglucose, n-acetyl cysteine, or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. taken together, the results presented here indicate for the first time that mt-hexokinase activity performed a key role as a preventive antioxidant against oxidative stress, reducing mitochondrial ros generation through an adp-recycling mechanism.
nutlin-3, a small molecule inhibitor, activates p53 by disrupting p53-hdm2 association. in this study, we found that nutlin-3 suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis in the absence of wild-type p53, suggesting a p53-independent mechanism for nutlin-3-induced cell death. like p53, its homolog p73 transactivates proapoptotic genes and induces cell death. since hdm2, a key negative regulator of p53, also binds to and inhibits p73, we asked whether p73 could mediate nutlin-3-induced apoptosis. we demonstrate that nutlin-3 inhibits endogenous binding between the proapoptotic p73 isoform tap73α and hdm2 in p53-null cells. dissociation of p73 and hdm2 leads to increased p73 transcriptional activity with upregulation of p73 target genes noxa, puma and p21, as well as enhanced apoptosis. p73 knockdown by sirna results in rescue of nutlin-3-treated cells, indicating that nutlin-3-induced apoptosis is, at least in part, p73 dependent. in addition, nutlin-3 treatment increases tap73α protein levels with prolongation of p73 half-life. these results provide the first evidence that nutlin-3 disrupts endogenous p73–hdm2 interaction and enhances the stability and proapoptotic activities of p73 and thus, provides a rationale for the use of nutlin-3 in the large number of human tumors in which p53 is inactivated. mdm2 is a critical negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. recently, small-molecule antagonists of mdm2, the nutlins, have been developed to inhibit the p53-mdm2 interaction and activate p53 signaling. however, half of human cancers have mutated p53 and they are resistant to nutlin treatment. here, we report that treatment of the p53-mutant malignant peripheral nerve sheath (mpnst) and p53-null hct116 cells with cisplatin (cis) and nutlin-3a induced a degree of apoptosis that was significantly greater than either drug alone. nutlin-3a also increased the cytotoxicity of both carboplatin and doxorubicin in a series of p53-mutant human tumor cell lines. in the human dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell line (ls141) and the p53 wild-type hct116 cells, nutlin-3a induced downregulation of e2f1 and this effect appeared to be proteasome dependent. in contrast, in mpnst and hctp53−/− cells, nutlin-3a inhibited the binding of e2f1 to mdm2 and induced transcriptional activation of free e2f1 in the presence of cis-induced dna damage. downregulation of e2f1 by small interfering rna significantly decreased the level of apoptosis induced by cis and nutlin-3a treatment. moreover, expression of a dominant-negative form of e2f1 rescued cells from apoptosis, whereas cells overexpressing wild-type e2f1 showed an increase in cell death. this correlated with the induction of the proapoptotic proteins p73α and noxa, which are both regulated by e2f1. these results indicate that antagonism of mdm2 by nutlin-3a in cells with mutant p53 enhances chemosensitivity in an e2f1-dependent manner. nutlin-3a therefore may provide a therapeutic benefit in tumors with mutant p53 provided it is combined with chemotherapy.
objective: acute hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (ahh) occurs frequently after tbi, as does chronic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. however, ahh and persistent hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (phh) after tbi are not well studied. the objective of this study was to characterize longitudinal hormone profiles and the impact of ahh and phh on outcome. methods: in this prospective cohort study, men with severe tbi (n = 38) had serum gonadal and gonadotropic hormones measured during weeks 1–52 post-injury. ahh, phh and/or early resolving hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (erhh) were based on temporal hormone assessments. phh and hormone profiles were then compared to multiple outcome measures 6–12 months post-tbi. results: ahh affected 100% of the population, while 37% subsequently developed phh. acute testosterone (test) and estradiol/testosterone (e2/test) ratios were associated with phh and outcome. over time, post-acute test and e2 levels for the erhh group approached normal range, while levels for the phh group remained low. post-acute gonadotrophin levels were within the normal range for both groups. phh, along with lower post-acute test and e2 profiles, was associated with worse functional and cognitive outcomes at 6 and 12 months post-injury. conclusions: these results support screening for post-acute secondary hypogonadism and further research to assess the mechanisms underlying phh and associated functional and cognitive deficits. background traumatic brain injury initiates several metabolic processes that can exacerbate the injury. there is evidence that hypothermia may limit some of these deleterious metabolic responses.   methods in a randomized, controlled trial, we compared the effects of moderate hypothermia and normothermia in 82 patients with severe closed head injuries (a score of 3 to 7 on the glasgow coma scale). the patients assigned to hypothermia were cooled to 33 degrees c a mean of 10 hours after injury, kept at 32 degrees to 33 degrees c for 24 hours, and then rewarmed. a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation who was unaware of the treatment assignments evaluated the patients 3, 6, and 12 months later with the use of the glasgow outcome scale.   results the demographic characteristics and causes and severity of injury were similar in the hypothermia and normothermia groups. at 12 months, 62 percent of the patients in the hypothermia group and 38 percent of those in the normothermia group had good outcomes (moderate, mild, or no disabilities). the adjusted risk ratio for a bad outcome in the hypothermia group was 0.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 1.2). hypothermia did not improve the outcomes in the patients with coma scores of 3 or 4 on admission. among the patients with scores of 5 to 7, hypothermia was associated with significantly improved outcomes at 3 and 6 months (adjusted risk ratio for a bad outcome, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.9 at both intervals), although not at 12 months (risk ratio, 0.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 1.0).   conclusions treatment with moderate hypothermia for 24 hours in patients with severe traumatic brain injury and coma scores of 5 to 7 on admission hastened neurologic recovery and may have improved the outcome.
abstract berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid plant extract that is widely available as a dietary supplement in the united states and has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. because of its increased use and purported pharmacological properties, potential variations in product quality could pose a barrier to berberine's safety and effectiveness in clinical practice. thus, this study evaluated the potency of dietary supplements containing berberine available in the u.s. commercial market. fifteen unique dietary supplements containing berberine were purchased through u.s. dietary supplement vendors. for each product, berberine was extracted from 3 unique capsules and analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. percentage content based on the product label claim was determined for each product. the average berberine content across the products was found to be 75% ± 25% of the product label claim, with product potency ranging from 33% to 100%. nine of the 15 tested products (60%) failed to meet the potency standards of 90% to 110% of labeled content claim, as commonly required of pharmaceutical preparations by the u.s. pharmacopeial convention. evaluation of the relationship between product cost and the measured potency failed to demonstrate an association between quality and cost. variability in product quality may significantly contribute to inconsistencies in the safety and effectiveness of berberine. in addition, the quality of the berberine product cannot be inferred from its cost. metabolic regulation is largely dependent on mitochondria, which play an important role in energy homeostasis. imbalance between energy intake and expenditure leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by a reduced ratio of energy production (atp production) to respiration. due to the role of mitochondrial factors/events in several apoptotic pathways, the possibility of targeting that organelle in the tumor cell, leading to its elimination is very attractive, although the safety issue is problematic. berberine, a benzyl-tetra isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from plants of the berberidaceae family, has been extensively used for many centuries, especially in the traditional chinese and native american medicine. several evidences suggest that berberine possesses several therapeutic uses, including anti-tumoral activity. the present review supplies evidence that berberine is a safe anti-cancer agent, exerting several effects on mitochondria, including inhibition of mitochondrial complex i and interaction with the adenine nucleotide translocator which can explain several of the described effects on tumor cells.
aquatic carnivorous plants usually grow in shallow dystrophic waters poor in inorganic n and p. utricularia australis was chosen as a model plant for its prolific distribution and great ecological plasticity. the photosynthetic co2 compensation point and factors associated with investment in carnivory and capture of prey were measured in 17 u. australis micropopulations in třeboň basin, czech republic, together with water chemistry factors at these sites differing greatly in their trophic level, water hardness, and prey availability. apical shoot growth rate was estimated at some oligotrophic sites. the micropopulations differed greatly in the proportion of traps with animal prey (2.7–70%, mean 26%), trap proportion to total biomass (1.4–42%, mean 26%), mean trap biomass (0.7–63 μg trap−1, mean 19 μg), and maximum trap size (1–3 mm, mean 2.0 mm). co2 compensation points ranged from 0.7 to 6.1 μm (mean 2.6 μm). a weak hco3− use (compensation point 0.51 mm) was found in plants growing in alkaline water. trap biomass proportion did not correlate significantly with prey capture and co2 compensation points with ambient [co2]. a very rapid apical growth (2.5–4.2 new nodes day−1) occurred in sand pits. thus, hco3− use in u. australis can be induced by growing at very high ph. co2 compensation points resembled those known in other aquatic non-carnivorous plants. they did not reflect carnivory. in spite of very rapid apical shoot growth, the relative growth rate of u. australis can be zero in oligotrophic habitats without prey. various ecophysiological investigations are presented in aldrovanda vesiculosa, a rootless aquatic carnivorous plant. a distinct polarity of n, p, and ca tissue content per dry mass (dm) unit was found along aldrovanda shoots. due to effective re-utilization, relatively small proportions of n (10 – 13 %) and p (33 – 43 %) are probably lost with senescent leaf whorls, while there is complete loss of all ca, k, and mg. the total content of starch and free sugars was 26 – 47 % dm along adult shoots, with the maximum in the 7th – 10th whorls. about 30 % of the total maximum sugar content was probably lost with dead whorls. the plant was found to take up 5 – 7 times more nh4+ to no3− from a mineral medium. under nearly-natural conditions in an outdoor cultivation container, catching of prey led to significantly more rapid growth than in unfed plants. dm of the fed controls was 48 % higher than in the unfed plants. the controls produced 0.69 branches per plant, while the unfed plants did not produced any. however, the n and p content per dm unit increased by 6 – 25 % in the apices and the first 6 whorls in the unfed variant, as compared to the fed controls. it may be suggested that carnivory is very important for aldrovanda.
backgroundinflammation following intracerebral hemorrhage (ich) significantly contributes to secondary brain damage and poor outcomes. prostaglandin e2 (pge2) is known to modulate neuroinflammatory responses and is upregulated in response to brain injury as a result of changes in inducible cyclooxygenase 2 (cox-2) and the membrane-bound type of pge synthase. inhibition of cox-2 activity has been reported to attenuate ich-induced brain injury; however, the clinical utility of such drugs is limited due to the potential for severe side effects. therefore, it is now important to search for downstream targets capable of preferentially modulating pge2 signaling, and the four e prostanoid receptors, ep1-4, which are the main targets of pge2, remain a viable therapeutic option. we have previously shown that ep1 receptor deletion aggravates ich-induced brain injury and impairs functional recovery, thus the current study aimed to elaborate on these results by including a pharmacologic approach targeting the ep1 receptor.resultschronic post-treatment with the selective ep1 receptor antagonist, sc-51089, increased lesion volume by 30.1 ± 14.5% (p < 0.05) and treatment with the ep1 agonist, 17-pt-pge2, improved neuromuscular functional recovery on grip strength (p < 0.01) and hanging wire (p < 0.05) behavioral testing. to begin identifying the mechanisms involved in ep1-mediated neuroprotection after ich, histology was performed to assess ferric iron content, neuroinflammation, leukocyte transendothelial migratory potential, and peripheral neutrophil and immunoglobulin infiltration. following ich, mice treated with the antagonist displayed increased ferric iron (p < 0.05) and cortical microgliosis (p < 0.05), whereas treatment with the agonist decreased cortical (p < 0.01) and striatal (p < 0.001) astrogliosis, leukocyte transendothelial migratory potential (p < 0.01), neutrophil infiltration (p < 0.05), and blood brain barrier breakdown (p < 0.05).conclusionsin agreement with our previous results, selective antagonism of the ep1 receptor aggravated ich-induced brain injury. furthermore, ep1 receptor agonism improved anatomical outcomes and functional recovery. thus, the present data continues to reinforce a putative role for ep1 as a new and more selective therapeutic target for the treatment of ich that could reduce the side effects associated with cox-2 inhibition while still exploiting the beneficial effects. reactive astrocytes adjacent to a forebrain stab injury were selectively ablated in adult mice expressing hsv-tk from the gfap promoter by treatment with ganciclovir. injured tissue that was depleted of gfap-positive astrocytes exhibited (1) a prolonged 25-fold increase in infiltration of cd45-positive leukocytes, including ultrastructurally identified monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, (2) failure of blood-brain barrier (bbb) repair, (3) substantial neuronal degeneration that could be attenuated by chronic glutamate receptor blockade, and (4) a pronounced increase in local neurite outgrowth. these findings show that genetic targeting can be used to ablate scar-forming astrocytes and demonstrate roles for astrocytes in regulating leukocyte trafficking, repairing the bbb, protecting neurons, and restricting nerve fiber growth after injury in the adult central nervous system.
vigorous exercise increases lactate and glucose uptake by the brain in excess of the increase in brain oxygen uptake. the metabolic fate of this non-oxidized carbohydrate entering the brain is poorly understood, but accumulation of lactate in the brain and/or increased net synthesis of amino acid neurotransmitters are possible explanations. previous proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1h-mrs) studies using conventional pulse sequences have not detected changes in brain lactate following exercise. this contrasts with 1h-mrs studies showing increased brain lactate when blood lactate levels are raised by an intravenous infusion of sodium lactate. using a j-editing 1h-mrs technique for measuring lactate, we demonstrated a significant 19% increase in lactate in the visual cortex following graded exercise to approximately 85% of predicted maximum heart rate. however, the magnitude of the increase was insufficient to account for more than a small fraction of the non-oxidized carbohydrate entering the brain with exercise. we also report a significant 18% increase in glx (combined signal from glutamate and glutamine) in visual cortex following exercise, which may represent an activity-dependent increase in glutamate. future studies will be necessary to test the hypothesis that non-oxidized carbohydrate entering the brain during vigorous exercise is directed, in part, toward increased net synthesis of amino acid neurotransmitters. the possible relevance of these findings to panic disorder and major depression is discussed. coupling between cerebral blood flow (cbf) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (cmro2) was studied using multiple sequential administrations of 15o-labeled radiotracers (half-life, 123 sec) and positron emission tomography. in the resting state an excellent correlation (mean r, 0.87) between cbf and cmro2 was found when paired measurements of cbf and cmro2 from multiple (30-48) brain regions were tested in each of 33 normal subjects. regional uncoupling of cbf and cmro2 was found, however, during neuronal activation induced by somatosensory stimulation. stimulus-induced focal augmentation of cerebral blood flow (29% mean) far exceeded the concomitant local increase in tissue metabolic rate (mean, 5%), when resting-state and stimulated-state measurements were obtained in each of 9 subjects. stimulus duration had no significant effect on response magnitude or on the degree of cbf-cmro2 uncoupling observed. dynamic, physiological regulation of cbf by a mechanism (neuronal or biochemical) dependent on neuronal firing per se, but independent of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, is hypothesized.
traumatic brain injury often produces executive dysfunction, causing long-term problems with behaviour and personality. de simoni et al. report that executive dysfunction following tbi is associated with altered corticostriatal interactions important for behavioural control. these findings provide a target for the evaluation of treatments aimed at improving executive function after tbi. individual differences in striatal dopamine (da) signaling have been associated both with individual differences in executive function in healthy individuals and with risk for psychiatric disorders defined by executive dysfunction. we used resting-state functional connectivity in 50 healthy adults to examine whether a polymorphism of the dopamine transporter gene (dat1), which regulates striatal da function, affects striatal functional connectivity in healthy adults, and whether that connectivity predicts executive function. we found that 9/10 heterozygotes, who are believed to have higher striatal da signaling, demonstrated stronger connectivity between dorsal caudate (dc) and insular, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, as well as between ventral striatum and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, than 10/10 homozygotes. across subjects, stronger dc-seeded connectivity predicted superior n-back working memory performance, while stronger ventral striatum-seeded connectivity predicted reduced impulsivity in everyday life. further, mediation analysis suggested that connectivity strength mediated relationships between dat1 genotype and behavior. these findings suggest that resting-state striato-frontal connectivity may be an endophenotype for executive function in healthy individuals.
here, we report that diesel exhaust particles (deps), a major constituent of urban air pollution, affect blood‐brain barrier function at the tissue, cellular, and molecular levels. isolated rat brain capillaries exposed to deps showed increased expression and transport activity of the key drug efflux transporter, p‐glycoprotein (6 h ec50 was ~5 μg/ml). upregulation of p‐glycoprotein was abolished by blocking transcription or protein synthesis. inhibition of nadph oxidase or pretreatment of capillaries with radical scavengers ameliorated dep‐induced p‐glycoprotein up‐regulation, indicating a role for reactive oxygen species in signaling. dep exposure also increased brain capillary tumor necrosis factor‐α (tnf‐α) levels. dep‐induced p‐glycoprotein up‐regulation was abolished when tnf‐receptor 1 (tnf‐r1) was blocked and was not evident in experiments with capillaries from tnf‐r1 knockout mice. inhibition of jnk, but not nf‐κb, blocked dep‐induced p‐glycoprotein up‐regulation, indicating a role for ap‐1 in the signaling pathway. consistent with this, deps increased phosphorylation of c‐jun. together, our results show for the first time that a component of air pollution, deps, alters blood‐brain barrier function through oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine production. these experiments disclose a novel blood‐brain barrier signaling pathway, with clear implications for environmental toxicology, cns pathology, and the pharmacotherapy of cns disorders.—hartz, a. m. s., bauer, b., block, m. l., hong, j.‐s., miller, d.‐s. diesel exhaust particles induce oxidative stress, proinflammatory signaling, and p‐glycoprotein up‐regulation at the blood‐brain barrier. faseb j. 22, 2723–2733 (2008) epidemiological studies demonstrate an association between short term exposure to ambient particulate matter (pm) and cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. although the biological mechanisms of these adverse effects are unknown, emerging data suggest a key role for oxidative stress. ambient pm and diesel exhaust particles (dep) contain redox cycling organic chemicals that induce pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effects in the lung. these responses are suppressed by n-acetylcysteine (nac), which directly complexes to electrophilic dep chemicals and exert additional antioxidant effects at the cellular level. a proteomics approach was used to study dep-induced responses in the macrophage cell line, raw 264.7. we demonstrate that in the dose range 10–100 μg/ml, organic dep extracts induce a progressive decline in the cellular gsh/gssg ratio, in parallel with a linear increase in newly expressed proteins on the two-dimensional gel. using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis, 32 newly induced/nac-suppressed proteins were identified. these include antioxidant enzymes (e.g. heme oxygenase-1 and catalase), pro-inflammatory components (e.g. p38mapk and rel a), and products of intermediary metabolism that are regulated by oxidative stress. heme oxygenase-1 was induced at low extract dose and with minimal decline in the gsh/gssg ratio, whereas map kinase activation required a higher chemical dose and incremental levels of oxidative stress. moreover, at extract doses >50 μg/ml, there is a steep decline in cellular viability. these data suggest that dep induce a hierarchical oxidative stress response in which some of these proteins may serve as markers for oxidative stress during pm exposures.
purposealmost 50 % of the patients experience moderate-to-severe pain during endometrial biopsy. the study aimed to examine the effectiveness of intrauterine lidocaine for relieving pain during endometrial biopsy.methodsa randomised trial was conducted in 120 patients undergoing endometrial biopsy. sixty-seven women were assigned to the paracervical block group and 53 were assigned to the intrauterine lidocaine group. the main outcome measure was pain intensity, measured using the visual analogue scale, during and after the procedure.resultsthe groups were similar with regard to age, body mass index, gravidity, total number of previous vaginal deliveries, menopausal status, and uterine depth. the pain scores immediately after the procedure were similar in the groups (p = 0.079). however, the pain scores 30 min after the procedure were significantly lower in the intrauterine group than in the paracervical group (p = 0.0001).conclusionscompared to paracervical block, intrauterine lidocaine may be the preferred anaesthesia for endometrial biopsy, and it does not cause any serious complications. objective to compare becteriostatic saline and buffered lidocaine for cervical anesthesia to blunt the reported pain during brief suction curettage. methods a double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on women presenting for pregnancy termination procedures. participants received either paracervical submucosal injections of bacteriostatic saline or 1% buffered lidocaine just before cervical dilation. self-reported pain intensity was assessed at three time points during and 30 minutes after the procedure. results fifty-two of 135 eligible women presenting for pregnancy termination procedures participated in the study. pain intensity ratings in lidocaine and saline treatment subjects did not differ significantly at any point. our study had a power of .094 to detect more than a 15% difference on the 21-point box scale between the two solutions. only one patient requested her block be repeated, and she had received lidocaine originally. furthermore, of those women receiving lidocaine, 11% reported mild toxicity symptoms. conclusion to minimize lidocaine toxicity for a brief suction curettage procedure, bacteriostatic saline or very dilute lidocaine could be considered for the paracervical injection rather than blockage of specific autonomic nerves when there is no waiting period. this would mean that the term paracervical block could be changed to cervical anesthesia.
backgroundoperative treatment of a displaced, transverse, noncomminuted fracture of the olecranon is associated with good to excellent elbow function in retrospective short-term followup studies. however, to our knowledge, no studies have evaluated objective and subjective outcomes using standardized outcome instruments (ie, dash and mayo elbow performance index [mepi]) to quantify long-term outcome of these specific fractures.questions/purposeswe evaluated (1) factors associated with disability, as measured with the dash questionnaire; (2) factors associated with ulnohumeral motion; (3) factors associated with pain intensity; and (4) general descriptive findings for posttraumatic arthrosis, mepi, ulnar neuropathy symptoms, and return to work between 10 and 32 years after open reduction and internal fixation (orif) of a transverse, noncomminuted fracture of the olecranon.methodsbetween 1977 and 1997, we performed orifs of transverse, noncomminuted olecranon fractures in 109 patients, of whom 35 had died, 14 had incomplete data in our registry, and 19 were lost to followup or declined participation, leaving 41 patients available for followup at a minimum of 10 years after surgery. during that time, our general indication for performing orif was greater than 2 mm displacement. the average age of these patients at the time of injury was 35 years (range, 18–73 years). patient-reported outcome was quantified using the dash questionnaire, and physician-based outcome was evaluated using the mepi. to identify factors associated with disability (dash), impairment (mepi), ulnohumeral motion, and pain, we examined demographic and clinical data in bivariate analyses, and subsequently significant factors in multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors of outcome.resultsthe sole factor associated with higher dash scores in multivariable analysis was age at surgery, explaining 20% of the variability, with younger patients performing better. the mean arc of elbow flexion was 142° (range, 110°–160°), and the variation was associated with arthrosis alone (ie, a greater arc of motion was associated with a lesser grade of arthrosis according to the system of broberg and morrey). pain was uncommon and generally was correlated with adverse events.conclusionsthe good results of operative fixation (tension-band wiring) of a transverse, displaced olecranon fracture are durable with time. patient-reported outcomes are excellent in the majority of patients. residual patient-rated disability does not correlate with arthrosis or loss of extension.level of evidencelevel iv, therapeutic study. see the guidelines for authors for a complete description of levels of evidence. thirty-seven consecutive olecranon fractures treated with tension-band wiring were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 4 years. there was no or mild pain in 33 cases, mean elbow extension was 7 degrees , and mean elbow flexion was 131 degrees . according to the mayo elbow performance score, the results were graded as good or excellent in 32 cases (86%). most patients had mild residual upper extremity disability (mean disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand score, 18 points). in 10 patients, degenerative changes developed. arthritic changes were significantly associated with elbow instability (p = .014) and length of follow-up (p = .031) and were more common in the presence of associated radial head or coronoid fractures (p = .06). hardware removal was required in 17 cases. tension-band wiring provides satisfactory results in a high percentage of olecranon fractures. however, the outcome may be compromised in the presence of elbow instability and associated fractures of the radial head and coronoid.
objectivethe objective of this study was to evaluate soft tissue contour changes after three different regenerative therapies in chronic ridge defects.material and methodsbuccal bone defects were created in the mandible of nine beagle dogs. augmentation procedures were performed 3 months later using a bone replacement graft (brg), resorbable collagen membrane (mbg), or a combination of both procedures (cbg). silicone impressions were taken before tooth extraction (t1), before the augmentation procedure (t2), and 3 months after the regenerative surgeries (t3). casts were optically scanned and stereolithography files were superimposed to analyze the horizontal changes in ridge contours.resultsafter defect creation, most part of the horizontal changes occurred 4 and 6 mm below the gingival margin. in the mesial defect (d1) at t3, the mean horizontal gain in mbg amounted to 0.47 ± 0.34 mm, 0.79 ± 0.67 mm in the brg, and 0.87 ± 0.69 mm for the cbg. in the middle defect (d2), the mean changes for the mbg were 0.11 ± 0.31, 1.01 ± 0.91 for the brg, and 0.98 ± 0.49 for the cbg. the mean changes in the distal defect (d3) amounted to 0.24 ± 0.72 for the mbg, 1.04 ± 0.92 for the brg, and 0.86 ± 0.56 for the cbg. the differences reached significance in all defects for the comparison mbg-brg and mbg-cbg, while similar parameters were observed for the comparison brg-cbg.conclusionbrg and cbg were equally effective and superior to mbg in increasing the horizontal tissue contours. the augmentation seldom reached the values before extraction.clinical relevancescaffolding materials are needed for contour augmentation when using resorbable collagen membranes. objectives to test whether or not vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue grafts are as successful as free subepithelial connective tissue grafts in augmenting volume defects in the anterior maxilla.   material and methods twenty subjects with seibert class 1 ridge defects in the anterior maxilla were randomly, equally assigned to augmentation by vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue graft (test) or free subepithelial connective tissue graft (control). clinical periodontal parameters at teeth adjacent to the gap were recorded, and conventional impressions were taken prior to surgery (baseline = t(0)) and 1 (t(1)), 3 (t(3)) and 6 (t(6)) months after surgery. the casts were optically scanned, digitized and analyzed for ridge contour changes in the augmented area. data were subjected to nonparametric statistics.   results the contour changes in labial distance between baseline and follow-up for the control group were (median, range) 1 mm, 0.37-1.45 (t(0)-t(1)); 1.18 mm, 0.39-1.40 (t(0)-t(3)); and 0.63 mm, 0.28-1.22 (t(0)-t(6)) and for test group 1.21 mm, 0.74-2.47 (t(0)-t(1)); 1.26 mm, 0.50-1.71 (t(0)-t(3)); and 1.18 mm, 0.16-1.75 (t(0)-t(6)). significantly less shrinkage of the graft was observed in the test group after 6 months (p = 0.03). clinical periodontal parameters at the neighboring teeth were stable over the follow-up period and did not differ between groups.   conclusions augmentation of single tooth gaps with moderate ridge defects in the anterior maxilla was successfully performed using both techniques. however, after 6 months, sites treated by the pediculated graft were superior in maintaining the initially augmented volume and showed less shrinkage of the graft. this could be attributed to better perfusion of the pediculated graft.
epidemiological studies have demonstrated a strong association between tobacco use and lung cancer; however, the genetic targets of these carcinogens and the role of other environmental agents in this process have yet to be defined. we examined the contribution of alcohol use and cigarette smoking to p53gene mutations in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. mutations of the p53 gene were detected by sequence analysis in 105 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. patient characteristics significantly associated with p53gene mutations were determined using logistic regression. mutations in the p53gene were present in 53% of the patients (56 of 105). p53 mutations were more common in patients who used alcohol than in patients who consumed less than one drink per day (72versus39%; p 5 0.003), and were detected more often smokers than nonsmokers (58%versus10%, p 5 0.02). mutations in the p53 gene were present more often ( p 5 0.01) in alcohol drinkers who smoked cigarettes [76% (31 of 41)], than in nondrinkers ( <1 drink per day) who smoked cigarettes [42% (20 of 48)] or in nondrinkers who did not smoke [14% (1 of 7)]. in conclusion, alcohol consumption and tobacco use are both associated withp53mutations in non-small cell lung cancer. the link between exposure to both alcohol and tobacco and p53mutations raises the possibility that alcohol may enhance the mutagenic effects of cigarette smoke in the lung. consumption of alcoholic beverages is an accepted social custom world-wide. this makes its involvement in events contributing to human cancer risk very important. although it is neither tumorigenic nor genotoxic in animals, ethanol can potentiate the carcinogenic risk associated with certain environmentally present agents. the reasons for such a synergistic action are speculative, but among theories postulated may be ethanol's ability to modify the toxicokinetics/dynamics of carcinogen metabolism. experiments conducted with rodents and primates support this hypothesis, demonstrating increased exposure of posthepatic organs to nitrosamines when given in combination with ethanol, followed by enhancement of dna adduct formation and, at least in rodents, of tumor development. in addition, ethanol may induce enzymes responsible for carcinogen activation, including hepatic cytochrome p450 2e1 in rodents and humans, and in lung, kidney, and brain in rodents. studies have also shown that these effects can extend to the next generation via maternal and in utero fetal exposure. what impact such ethanol-induced modulations have on tumorigenesis during childhood and later stages of life needs to be investigated further.
chemistry retraction for “solvent molecules bridge the mechanical unfolding transition state of a protein,” by lorna dougan, gang feng, hui lu, and julio m. fernandez, which appeared in issue 9, march 4, 2008, of proc natl acad sci usa (105:3185–3190; first published february 27, 2008; 10.1073/pnas.0706075105). the authors note the following: “we wish to retract our article because interpretation of the experimental data was based on incorrect calibration of the apparatus in viscous solutions and there is no basis for the major conclusions of the study on the structure of the transition state for mechanical unfolding.” osmolytes are small organic compounds that affect protein stability and are ubiquitous in living systems. in the equilibrium protein folding reaction, unfolded (u) ⇌ native (n), protecting osmolytes push the equilibrium toward n, whereas denaturing osmolytes push the equilibrium toward u. as yet, there is no universal molecular theory that can explain the mechanism by which osmolytes interact with the protein to affect protein stability. here, we lay the groundwork for such a theory, starting with a key observation: the transfer free energy of protein backbone from water to a water/osmolyte solution, δgtr, is negatively correlated with an osmolyte’s fractional polar surface area. δgtr measures the degree to which an osmolyte stabilizes a protein. consequently, a straightforward interpretation of this correlation implies that the interaction between the protein backbone and osmolyte polar groups is more favorable than the corresponding interaction with nonpolar groups. such an interpretation immediately suggests the existence of a universal mechanism involving osmolyte, backbone, and water. we test this idea by using it to construct a quantitative solvation model in which backbone/solvent interaction energy is a function of interactant polarity, and the number of energetically equivalent ways of realizing a given interaction is a function of interactant surface area. using this model, calculated δgtr values show a strong correlation with measured values (r = 0.99). in addition, the model correctly predicts that protecting/denaturing osmolytes will be preferentially excluded/accumulated around the protein backbone. taken together, these model-based results rationalize the dominant interactions observed in experimental studies of osmolyte-induced protein stabilization and denaturation.
to reach the egg in the ampulla, sperm have to travel along the female genital tract, thereby being dependent on external energy sources and substances to maintain and raise the flagellar beat. the vaginal fluid is rich in lactate, whereas in the uterine fluid glucose is the predominant substrate. this evokes changes in the lactate content of sperm as well as in the intracellular ph (phi) since sperm possess lactate/proton co-transporters. it is well documented that glycolysis yields atp and that hco3− is a potent factor in the increase of beat frequency. we here show for the first time a pathway that connects both parts. we demonstrate a doubling of beat frequency in the mere presence of glucose. this effect can reversibly be blocked by 2-deoxy-d-glucose, dichloroacetate and aminooxyacetate, strongly suggesting that it requires both glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidation of glycolytic end products. we show that the glucose-mediated acceleration of flagellar beat and atp production are hastened by a phi ≥7.1, whereas a phi ≤7.1 leaves both parameters unchanged. since we observed a diminished rise in beat frequency in the presence of specific inhibitors against carbonic anhydrases, soluble adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase, we suggest that the glucose-mediated effect is linked to co2 hydration and thus the production of hco3− by intracellular ca isoforms. in summary, we propose that, in sperm, glycolysis is an additional phi-dependent way to produce hco3−, thus enhancing sperm beat frequency and contributing to fertility. mammalian spermatozoa expend energy, generated as intracellular atp, largely on motility. if the sperm cell cannot swim by use of its flagellar motion, it cannot fertilize the egg. studies of the means by which this energy is generated span a period of six decades. this review gives an overview of these studies, which demonstrate that both mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, for which oxygen is friend, and glycolysis, for which sugar is friend, can provide the energy, independent of one another. in mouse sperm, glycolysis appears to be the dominant pathway; in bull sperm, oxidative phosphorylation is the predominant pathway. in the case of bull sperm, the high activity of the glycolytic pathway would maintain the intracellular ph too low to allow sperm capacitation; here sugar is enemy. the cow's oviduct has very low glucose concentration, thus allowing capacitation to go forward. the choice of the pathway of energy generation in vivo is set by the conditions in the oviduct of the conspecific female. the phospholipids of the sperm plasma membrane have a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids represented in their acyl moieties, rendering them highly susceptible to lipid peroxidation; in this case oxygen is enemy. but the susceptibility of the sperm membrane to lethal damage by lipid peroxidation allows the female oviduct to dispose of sperm that have overstayed their welcome, and so keep in balance sperm access to the egg and sperm removal once this has occurred.
the emotional consequences of fatherhood are markedly conditional on the context in which fatherhood is lived out. this study examines the association between different contemporary forms of fatherhood and paternal psychological well-being. the data are from an anonymous online survey of 3615 biological fathers, stepfathers, adoptive fathers, and foster fathers across the german-speaking countries of central europe. first, a detailed characterization of the different existing family constellations is provided. second, the consequences of these different contemporary forms of fatherhood for paternal psychological well-being are investigated. fathers of all ages (m = 40.11, range: 19–72) with at least one child under the age of 18 were included in the present analysis (n = 2785). the presented findings demonstrate that a family structure consisting of two biological parents with biological children seems to be most beneficial to paternal well-being, while some other forms of contemporary fatherhood are associated with impaired well-being, independently of sociodemographic or relationship aspects. more specifically, a history of family separation in non-residential biological fathers and blended-family fathers, and the concomitant loss of father–child contact, is shown to be particularly disadvantageous for the well-being of these fathers. shared living arrangements, maintaining regular contact with biological children, or forming a new intact family could protect these fathers from negative outcomes. objective the prevalence and etiology of pre- and postpartum depressive symptoms in women in a variety of family forms have been well documented, but relatively little research has been conducted on the adjustment of their male partners. the authors' goals in this study were 1) to estimate rates of depression during the pregnancy and 8 weeks following the birth of a child in a large representative community sample of fathers in different family structures and 2) to explore the role of stressful life events, social and emotional support, the quality of the partner relationship, and socioeconomic circumstances.   method this study describes the relations of family setting and other correlates to men's depressive symptoms during the pregnancies (18 weeks gestation, on average) and 8 weeks after the births of children for 7,018 partners of female participants in the avon longitudinal study of pregnancy and childhood.   results men living in stepfamilies had-significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms before and after the birth than did men in more traditional families. the effect of stepfamily status on depression was mediated by education, life events, social support, social network, and level of aggression in the partnership.   conclusions there are similarities in the patterns and correlates of depression after the birth of a child for men and women. these findings point to the importance of family and partnership ecology in the adjustment of men before and after the birth of a child.
background leishmania major is an old world species causing cutaneous leishmaniasis and is transmitted by phlebotomus papatasi and phlebotomus duboscqi. in brazil, two isolates from patients who never left the country were characterised as l. major-like (bh49 and bh121). using molecular techniques, these isolates were indistinguishable from the l. major reference strain (fv1). objectives we evaluated the lipophosphoglycans (lpgs) of the strains and their behaviour in old and new world sand fly vectors. methods lpgs were purified, and repeat units were qualitatively evaluated by immunoblotting. experimental in vivo infection with l. major-like strains was performed in lutzomyia longipalpis (new world, permissive vector) and ph. papatasi (old world, restrictive or specific vector). findings the lpgs of both strains were devoid of arabinosylated side chains, whereas the lpg of strain bh49 was more galactosylated than that of strain bh121. all strains with different levels of galactosylation in their lpgs were able to infect both vectors, exhibiting colonisation of the stomodeal valve and metacyclogenesis. the bh121 strain (less galactosylated) exhibited lower infection intensity compared to bh49 and fv1 in both vectors. main conclusions intraspecific variation in the lpg of l. major-like strains occur, and the different galactosylation levels affected interactions with the invertebrate host. lipophosphoglycan (lpg) is an abundant surface molecule that plays key roles in the infectious cycle ofleishmania major. the dominant feature of lpg is a polymer of phosphoglycan (pg) (6galβ1,4manα1-po4) repeating units. in l. major these are extensively substituted with gal(β1,3) side chains, which are required for binding to midgut lectins and survival. we utilized evolutionary polymorphisms in lpg structure and cross-species transfections to recover genes encoding the lpg side chain β1,3-galactosyltransferases (βgalts). a dispersed family of six scg genes was recovered, whose predicted proteins exhibited characteristics of eukaryotic galts. at least four of these proteins showed significant lpg side chain βgalt activity; scg3 exhibited initiating galt activity whereas scg2 showed both initiating and elongating galt activity. however, the activity ofscg2 was context-dependent, being largely silent in its normal genomic milieu, and different strains show considerable variation in the extent of lpg galactosylation. thus thel. major genome encodes a family of scgs with varying specificity and activity, and we propose that strain-specific lpg galactosylation patterns reflect differences in their expression.
peroxisomes are important organelles in plant metabolism, containing all the enzymes required for fatty acid -oxidation. more than 20 proteins are required for peroxisomal biogenesis and maintenance. the arabidopsis pxa1 mutant, originally isolated because it is resistant to the auxin indole-3-butyric acid (iba), developmentally arrests when germinated without supplemental sucrose, suggesting defects in fatty acid -oxidation. because iba is converted to the more abundant auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (iaa), in a mechanism that parallels -oxidation, the mutant is likely to be iba resistant because it cannot convert iba to iaa. adult pxa1 plants grow slowly compared with wild type, with smaller rosettes, fewer leaves, and shorter inflorescence stems, indicating that pxa1 is important throughout development. we identified the molecular defect in pxa1 using a map-based positional approach. pxa1 encodes a predicted peroxisomal atp-binding cassette transporter that is 42% identical to the human adrenoleukodystrophy (ald) protein, which is defective in patients with the demyelinating disorder x-linked ald. homology to ald protein and other human and yeast peroxisomal transporters suggests that pxa1 imports coenzyme a esters of fatty acids and iba into the peroxisome for -oxidation. the pxa1 mutant makes fewer lateral roots than wild type, both in response to iba and without exogenous hormones, suggesting that the iaa derived from iba during seedling development promotes lateral root formation. the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (aldp) is an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter in the human peroxisome membrane. it is defective in x chromosome-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ald), a neurodegenerative disorder with impaired peroxisomal oxidation of very long chain fatty acids. we report cloning and characterization of pxa1, a yeast gene encoding a protein (pxa1p) exhibiting high similarity to aldp. disruption of pxa1 results in impaired growth on oleic acid and reduced ability to oxidize oleate. pxa1p is peroxisome associated; however, in the pxa1 mutant yeast, as in ald cells, peroxisomes are morphologically intact. disruption of a second yeast gene, ykl741, which encodes a more distantly related aldp homolog (yk174p), in either wild-type or pxa1 mutant yeast, results in a growth phenotype identical to that of the pxa1 mutant. this result suggests that yk1741p and pxa1p may be subunits of the same transporter. sequence analysis of pxa1p, aldp, and related abc transporters reveals a possible fatty acid binding domain and a 14-amino acid eaa-like motif, previously described only in prokaryotes. because of the similarities in sequence and function, we propose that pxa1p is the saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of aldp.
due to human activities huge amount of organic wastes are simply dumped in the environment creating disposal and pollution problems. suitable and sustainable utilization of these wastes is vermicomposting which converts wastes in to wealth. in the present study, 1:1 proportion (wt./wt.) of vegetable market waste (vmw) and press mud (sugar industry waste) mixture have been used for vermicomposting with the earthworm perionyx ceylanensis mich. the predecomposition after air drying of vegetable market waste was conducted for 15 days by sprinkling water and regular turning. to predecomposed vmw, press mud in 1:1 proportion by weight was added and moistened to hold 65-75% water and after 24 hrs stabilization, the earthworms were introduced. all the experiments were maintained in triplicates up to 60 days. physico-chemical changes were recorded in vermibed materials time to time. the results showed that the important nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were higher than that of initial and worm-unworked compost, whereas, the organic carbon and c/n ratio showed decrease. the study clearly shows that the vmw in combination with press mud is suitable for vermicomposting with p. ceylanensis. recycling of guar gum industrial waste through vermitechnology was studied under laboratory conditions by using composting earthworm perionyx excavatus (perrier). three different combination of guar gum industrial waste namely guar gum industrial waste:cow dung:saw dust in 40:30:30 ratio (t1), guar gum industrial waste:cow dung:saw dust in 60:20:20 ratio (t2), and guar gum industrial waste:cow dung:saw dust in 75:15:10 ratio (t3) were used for vermicomposting experiments. chemical changes during vermicomposting were measured and comparatively t2 showed great increase (from its initial level) for total n (25.4%), phosphorus (72.8%) and potassium (20.9%) than the other treatments. t2 also showed higher vermicomposting coefficient (vc), higher mean biomass for p. excavatus (146.68 mg) and higher cocoon production (about 21.9% and 645.5% more than the t1 and t3, respectively). maximum earthworm mortality during vermicomposting was recorded with t3 treatment while zero mortality was recorded for t2 treatment after 150 days. overall, t2 treatment appeared to be an ideal combination for enhancing maximum biopotential of earthworms to management guar gum industrial waste as well as for earthworm biomass and cocoon production.
zusammenfassunghintergrund: bei der tako-tsubo kardiomyopathie (ttk) handelt es sich um ein akutes kardiales krankheitsbild mit auftreten eines akuten thoraxschmerzes nach vorangegangener stressexposition. elektrokardiographisch finden sich zeichen einer myokardischämie oder eines myokardinfarktes, echokardiographisch liegt eine meist apikale reversible wandbewegungsstörung vor. im gegensatz zum myokardinfarkt zeigt das koronarangiogramm unauffällige koronararterien. die ttk wurde erstmals in japan anfang der 90iger jahre beschrieben. zunehmend wurde dieses überwiegend bei älteren frauen auftretende akute krankheitsbild auch in anderen ländern festgestellt, wobei bis zu 2% aller suspizierten st-hebungs-myokardinfarkte betroffen sind. abgesehen von fallberichten liegen diesbezüglich jedoch keine daten aus österreich vor. patienten und methoden: wir analysierten häufigkeit, diagnostische charakteristika und den klinischen verlauf von patienten mit ttk, die in einem zeitraum von 4 jahren (2004–2008) akut an unserer kardiologischen abteilung aufgenommen wurden. die diagnose wurde aufgrund der typischen reversiblen wandbewegungsstörung im ventrikulogramm und echokardiogramm bei fehlen von signifikanten koronarstenosen gestellt. unter den in diesem zeitraum einer herzkatheteruntersuchung unterzogenen 448 patienten mit verdacht auf akuten st-hebungsinfarkt (stemi) und 963 patienten mit nicht-st hebungsinfarkt (nstemi) wurde bei 31 patienten (2,2%) eine ttk diagnostiziert. resultate: patienten mit ttk waren überwiegend postmenopausale frauen (90,3% frauen, durchschnittsalter: 75 ± 10,2 jahren). leitsymptom bei der aufnahme waren akute brustschmerzen bei 24 patienten (77,4%), atemnot bei 10 patienten (32,3%) und hypotension bei einem patienten (3,2%). bei 24 patienten (77,4%) ging der manifestation starker emotionaler (n = 9, 29%) oder physischer stress (n = 15, 48,4%) voraus. akute st hebungen fanden sich bei 13 patienten (42%) und isolierte st/t wellen veränderungen bei 18 patienten (58%). alle patienten wiesen einen passageren anstieg der kardialen nekrosemarker auf. eine signifikante koronarstenose konnte bei keinem patienten koronarangiographisch nachgewiesen werden. nach einem durchschnittlichen klinischen follow-up von 172,4 (± 342,8) tagen waren 3 patienten an nicht kardialer ursache verstorben, eine weitere patientin musste 13 monate nach dem indexereignis erneut wegen einer ttk hospitalisiert werden. schlussfolgerung: die klinische symptomatik sowie die elektrokardiographischen veränderungen der ttk simulieren das erscheinungsbild eines akuten myokardinfarkts. hinweise für das vorliegen einer ttk sind eine vorangegangene stressexposition bei älteren frauen, die typische wandbewegungsstörung im echokardiogramm und der nur geringe anstieg der kardialen nekrosemarker. die durchführung einer akut-koronar-angiographie sollte möglichst rasch erfolgen, um einen akuten koronararteriellen verschluss auszuschließen und um eine inadäquate behandlung wie z.b. eine thrombolyse zu vermeiden.summarybackground: the syndrome of tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy (ttc) is characterized by the occurrence of acute chest pain, electrocardiographic signs of ischemia, and transient balloon-like abnormalities in cardiac wall motion mostly involving the left ventricular apex. significant obstructive coronary artery disease is absent. owing to its clinical and imaging characteristics, ttc is frequently misdiagnosed as an acute coronary syndrome. tako-tsubo syndrome was first described in the 1990s in japan, but meanwhile has been increasingly identified in other parts of the world also. ttc predominantly affects postmenopausal women, and may involve up to 2% of all patients with acute st-segment elevation myocardial infarction (stemi). apart from single case reports, no systematic data from austria are currently available. patients and methods: we analyzed prevalence, diagnostic characteristics and the clinical course of patients with ttc admitted to our cardiology department during a period of four years (may 2004 – december 2008). diagnosis of ttc was established by the presence of the typical apical ballooning pattern of the left ventricle shown by ventriculography or echocardiography and by the absence of a significant coronary artery stenosis as demonstrated by coronary angiography. among 448 patients with suspected acute stemi and 963 patients with non-stemi, 31 patients (2.2%) were diagnosed as having ttc. results: the majority of identified patients with ttc were postmenopausal women (90.3% women, mean age 75 ± 10.2 years). at the time of acute hospital admission, the principal symptom was chest pain in 24 patients (77.4%), dyspnea in 10 (32.3%) and hypotension in one (3.2%). preceding emotionally or physically stressful events were identified in 24 patients (77.4%: emotional 29%, physical 48.4%). acute st-segment elevation was present in 13 patients (42%) and st/t wave abnormalities were found in 18 (58%). all patients demonstrated a distinct increase in levels of cardiac enzymes and biomarkers. significant coronary artery stenosis was absent in all patients. after a clinical follow-up period of 172.4 ± 342.8 days, three patients had died from non-cardiac causes, ttc had recurred in another patient 13 months after the index event, and the other 27 patients were free from cardiac symptoms and the electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities had resolved. conclusion: patients with ttc display clinical symptoms and electrocardiographic findings that mimic acute myocardial infarction. a history of a preceding stressful event in elderly women, typical echocardiographic findings of ttc, and only a mild elevation of cardiac markers will be informative. acute-coronary angiography should be performed in order to rule out acute coronary occlusion and to avoid inadequate treatment such as thrombolysis. key summary points the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome is a novel cardiac syndrome. it is characterized by peculiar transient apical ballooning of the left ventricle, which is the result of characteristic wall-motion abnormalities in the left ventricular apex and mid-ventricle. despite the absence of obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease, clinical presentation in patients with the syndrome is similar to that of patients with st-segment elevation myocardial infarction. postmenopausal women seem to be most at risk for developing the syndrome. an episode of acute emotional or physiologic stress seems to often precede presentation with the syndrome. patients with the syndrome should be monitored and treated for left heart failure, dynamic intraventricular obstruction, arrhythmias, and mechanical complications, should they develop. patients with the syndrome seem to have a favorable in-hospital prognosis despite the development of acute left-sided heart failure and hemodynamic instability in many patients. the cause of the syndrome is not yet known. the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome, also known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is a recently described novel acute cardiac syndrome. the syndrome is characterized by peculiar, yet characteristic, transient regional systolic dysfunction involving the left ventricular apex and mid-ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal left ventricular segments. the syndrome was initially recognized and reported in the japanese population (1-6). dote and colleagues (1) were one of the first to describe the syndrome, which was given the moniker tako-tsubo-like left ventricular dysfunction, naming it after a round-bottomed narrow-necked japanese fishing pot used for trapping octopus (figure 1, parts a, b, and c). more recently, the condition has been called transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome in reference to the associated left ventricular morphologic features that accompany the syndrome. after the initial recognition and description of the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome in the japanese population, subsequent recent reports have documented the syndrome in the united states (7) and belgium (8). despite the acute onset of transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction involving the left ventricular apex and mid-ventricle, patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome do not have obstructive atherosclerotic coronary disease. the cause of the syndrome is unknown. figure 1. left ventriculograms (end-systole) of 2 patients

ballooning syndrome have included relatively few patients. this review presents reported case series of the syndrome in order to more precisely summarize the demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of patients presenting with the syndrome. in addition, we review the available literature evaluating possible pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the syndrome. methods literature search and identification of relevant studies we identified relevant english-language articles pertaining to the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome by searching the pubmed and embase databases (through june 2004). the following search terms were used to identify primary articles: left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, ampulla cardiomyopathy, and transient left ventricular dysfunction. we then manually searched references from the primary articles. we included only peer-reviewed reports and did not search for unpublished data. when more than 1 case series was reported from the same medical center, we included the case series reporting on the largest number of patients and excluded those with fewer patients to avoid duplicate reporting. only case series reporting on at least 5 consecutive patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome were initially identified and assessed for potential inclusion in this case series review. case reports and small case series reporting on fewer than 5 patients were not included in the review in an attempt to minimize potential reporting bias of uncharacteristic or nonrepresentative cases. we included prospective and retrospective case series. figure 2 outlines the search and selection process. figure 2. study identification. case series and data assessment we identified 13 case series for potential inclusion in this review. of these, 10 reported on unselected, consecutive patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome. seven of these 10 case series reported on patients who met the following criteria and were subsequently included in this review. first, the patient must have had transient apical and midleft ventricular wall-motion abnormalities resulting in the left ventricular morphologic appearance of apical ballooning. second, coronary angiography data that excluded obstructive atherothrombotic coronary artery disease as the causative mechanism for left ventricular dysfunction had to be available. third, the study had to report on patient demographic characteristics, presenting symptoms, clinical presentation, electrocardiographic characteristics, laboratory data, cardiac catheterization data, clinical complications, and clinical outcome. of the 3 excluded series reporting on consecutive patients, 2 were excluded because they lacked coronary angiography data for all patients (9, 10), and 1 was excluded because it reported on only 2 patients (11). in addition, data that addressed potential pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome were identified by using the search strategy described earlier. these data were then reviewed and summarized. one author read and assessed all studies. results table 1 summarizes the 7 case series that met the inclusion criteria for this review. of these, 5 reports were from japan (2-6), 1 was from the united states (7), and 1 was from belgium (8). three studies reported prospectively collected data, 2 studies reported retrospective data, and 2 studies did not specify the prospective or retrospective nature of the study. table 1. demographic and clinical characteristics of consecutive patients given a diagnosis of the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome demographic characteristics and presenting symptoms all 7 case series consistently reported a sex discrepancy in patients presenting with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome: most patients were women (range, 82% to 100%). the mean age of patients presenting with the syndrome was 62 to 75 years (overall range, 10 to 88 years). patients often presented with chest pain at rest (33% to 71%), although dyspnea as the initial symptom was not uncommon. isolated cases of syncope as the presenting symptom have been reported (2, 4, 5, 7). electrocardiographic data the most common finding on the admission electrocardiogram was st-segment elevation (range, 46% to 100% of patients). all series except 1 reported st-segment elevation in at least 81% of patients. st-segment elevation, when present, was most often reported in the precordial leads. concomitant st-segment elevation in the inferior leads has been reported in a few cases, and isolated inferior or lateral st-segment elevation seems to be an unusual electrocardiographic finding in patients presenting with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome. new left and right bundle-branch block on the presenting electrocardiogram has been reported. almost all series patients developed evolutionary t-wave inversions that were usually present in most leads. new pathologic q waves on the electrocardiogram were reported in 6% to 31% of patients; in some instances, the q waves were transient. the corrected qt interval on the presenting electrocardiogram was prolonged; it ranged from a mean of 450 milliseconds to 501 milliseconds. cardiac enzyme and biomarker release most patients had a small, rapid increase in cardiac enzyme and biomarker levels. fifty-six percent to 100% of patients had a peak cardiac enzyme or biomarker level above the upper limit of normal. the series reporting a 56% incidence of cardiac enzyme increase assessed only creatine kinase (3), whereas the 2 series reporting a 100% incidence of biomarker release evaluated cardiac troponin (7, 8). several series have reported that peak cardiac biomarker levels are often those drawn at the time of initial presentation; they appear to not follow the slow rise-and- fall kinetics observed with conventional myocardial infarction. angiographic data and left ventricular function patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome had either no angiographically detectable coronary disease (range, 25% to 100% of patients) or nonobstructive coronary disease (range, 0% to 75% of patients). none of the patients had epicardial stenosis greater than 50% of the luminal coronary artery diameter. patients with the syndrome had an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction at presentation (mean, 0.39 to 0.49) that improved rapidly over a period of days to weeks (mean follow-up left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.60 to 0.76). apical and mid-ventricular regional wall-motion abnormalities completely resolved in most patients and followed a time course similar to that of the associated improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. four studies reported endomyocardial biopsy results in the acute phase of the syndrome (n= 18), with no evidence of myocarditis (2, 4-6). evaluations of endothelial function and coronary microcirculation either spontaneous or provocable multivessel epicardial spasm was present in a few patients; the incidence of provoca

introductionthe 'reading the mind in the eyes' test (rmet) is a test of the theory of mind (tom), the ability to infer the states of minds of other people (baron-cohen, 2001). tom includes the recognition of emotional information from the face, voice, and body (tagerflusberg & sullivan, 1994). theory of mind allows for the acquiring of knowledge about other people and for constructing ideas about what people think and feel. the tom allows for the constructing of beliefs about other people, making it easier to understand another person's motives and intensions (baron-cohen, 2001). the key aspect of the tom is an ability to take the perspective of other persons, which is what makes this theoretical construct close to cognitive empathy (philips et al., 2002).the human face is one of the most important social stimuli with which we deal every day. from the emotional expression on a face, we are able to assess whether a person is friendly or hostile, and we can infer a wide range of mental states. these inferences enable a rapid response in different social situations (itier & batty, 2009). the eye area is the most important area of the face in allowing others to recognize facial expressions and their underlying emotions (baron-cohen, 1994). we devote more time to the eye area than to other parts of the face (itier, villate, & ryan, 2007; mckelvie, 1976; fraser, craig, & parker, 1990; itier & batty, 2009; althoff & cohen, 1999; baron-cohen, baldwin, & crowson, 1997). other studies also supported the neural basis of this behavior. the superior temporal sulcus (sts) and the superior temporal gyrus (stg) specialize in the perception of the eyes and face. both are activated by the visual stimuli of the eyes during performance on the rmet (baroncoh en, ring, wh eel wr i gh t , bullmore, brammer, simmons, & williams, 1999; itier, alain, sedore, & mcintosh, 2007; moor, op de macks, guroglu, rombouts, van der molen, & crone, 2012).eyes and gaze play an important role in social interactions. avoiding or failing to maintain eye contact and difficulty in joint attention (baron-cohen, 1987) are associated with impaired social communication and impaired ability to read the mental states of others, which occur commonly in people with autism (baron-cohen, jolliffe, mortimore, & robertson, 1997).the original version of the rmet was developed for adults in 1997 and was subsequently modified by adding more response options and improving the psychometric properties of the tool (baron-cohen, jolliffe et al., 1997; baron-cohen et al., 2001). the test consists of 36 questions concerning choosing the right emotion or thought corresponding to a particular pair of eyes shown on a picture. a greater proportion of correct answers corresponds to a higher test score.the rmet assesses the ability to read emotional states of other people from the expression around their eyes (baron-cohen, wheelwright, hill, raste, & plumb, 2001). this tool was created to identify subtle deficits in autism and asperger 's syndrome (baron-cohen et al., 2001). currently, rmet is often applied to study individual differences such as sexual or age differences in the tom (baron-cohen et al., 2001, and bailey et al., 2008, respectively). the results revealed that women score higher in the original rmet than men (e.g., baron-cohen et al., 2001). these findings seem related to the results of the research, which has shown that empathy is more developed in women than in men (goldenfeld et al., 2005; baron-cohen, richler, bisarya, gurunathan, & wheelwright, 2003; geary et al., 1998; macoby et al., 1999). from earliest infancy, girls spend more time looking at faces, particularly the eyes, whereas boys turn their attention to moving objects (connellan, baron -coh en, wheel wr i ght , batki, & ahluwalia, 2008). women interpret all nonverbal messages more accurately on the basis of facial expression (e. … the present paper investigated recognition errors in affective judgement of facial emotional expressions. twenty-eight females and sixteen males participated in the study. the results showed that in both males and females emotional displays could be correctly classified, but females had a higher rate of correct classification; males were more likely to have difficulty distinguishing one emotion from another. females rated emotions identically regardless of whether the emotion was displayed by a male or female face. furthermore, the two-factor structure of emotion, based on a valence and an arousal dimension, was only present for female subjects. these results further extend our knowledge about gender differences in affective information processing.
scfv(frp5)-eta is a recombinant single-chain antibody-toxin with binding specificity for erbb2/her2. previously potent antitumoral activity of the molecule against erbb2 overexpressing tumor cells was demonstrated in vitro and in animal models. here we report on the first application of scfv(frp5)-eta in human cancer patients summarizing case reports collected in four different clinical centers. eleven patients suffering from metastatic breast and colorectal cancers and from malignant melanoma were treated on a compassionate-use basis by intratumoral injection of scfv(frp5)-eta into cutaneous lesions once daily for 7–10 days. total daily doses ranged from 60 to 900 µg, and total doses per treatment cycle ranged from 0.6 to 6.0 mg. treatment caused injected tumors to shrink in six of the 10 cases evaluated (60%). complete regression of injected tumor nodules was accomplished in four patients (40%) and partial reduction in tumor size in another two patients (20%). adverse reactions were restricted to local symptoms such as pain and inflammation at injection sites which were fully reversible. only in one patient treated at the highest daily doses systemic liver toxicity of grade 2 was observed and treatment was discontinued on day 7. no hematologic, renal, and/or cardiovascular toxicities were noted. our results demonstrate that local therapy with scfv(frp5)-eta can be effective against erbb2 expressing tumors justifying further clinical development of this reagent. abstract. the tumour antigen erbb-2 belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor family. numerous studies have shown that erbb-2 is overexpressed in many cancers and it is prognostically important in a subset of malignancies. it is well recognised that this receptor has many characteristics that make it an excellent target for tumour-specific immunotherapy. one anti-erbb-2 monoclonal antibody, herceptin or trastuzumab, has already shown clinical efficacy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. however, despite this success, it is still currently unclear how monoclonal antibodies inhibit tumour growth in vivo. this review will summarise the biological activities of a range of anti-erbb-2 mabs, as well as their possible mechanisms of action. in addition, as an active mode of immunotherapy, the current vaccine strategies for inducing or enhancing erbb-2-specific immunity will also be discussed. it is anticipated that a better understanding of the activities of anti-erbb-2 mabs will aid in the development of both passive and active immunotherapies against this important receptor.
otoacoustic emissions serve as a noninvasive probe of the medial olivocochlear (moc) reflex. stimulus frequency otoacoustic emissions (sfoaes) elicited by a low-level probe tone may be the optimal type of emission for studying moc effects because at low levels, the probe itself does not elicit the moc reflex [guinan et al. (2003) j. assoc. res. otolaryngol. 4:521]. based on anatomical considerations, the moc reflex activated by ipsilateral acoustic stimulation (mediated by the crossed olivocochlear bundle) is predicted to be stronger than the reflex to contralateral stimulation. broadband noise is an effective activator of the moc reflex; however, it is also an effective activator of the middle-ear muscle (mem) reflex, which can make results difficult to interpret. the mem reflex may be activated at lower levels than measured clinically, and most previous human studies have not explicitly included measurements to rule out mem reflex contamination. the current study addressed these issues using a higher-frequency sfoae probe tone to test for cochlear changes mediated by the moc reflex, while simultaneously monitoring the mem reflex using a low-frequency probe tone. broadband notched noise was presented ipsilaterally at various levels to elicit probe-tone shifts. measurements are reported for 15 normal-hearing subjects. with the higher-frequency probe near 1.5 khz, only 20% of subjects showed shifts consistent with an moc reflex in the absence of an mem-induced shift. with the higher-frequency probe near 3.5 khz, up to 40% of subjects showed shifts in the absence of an mem-induced shift. however, these responses had longer time courses than expected for moc-induced shifts, and may have been dominated by other cochlear processes, rather than moc reflex. these results suggest caution in the interpretation of effects observed using ipsilaterally presented acoustic activators intended to excite the moc reflex. it is well established that low-level broad band noise can elicit an amplitude decrease in evoked otoacoustic emissions recorded in the opposite ear. however, the influence of the temporal characteristics of the contralateral stimulus on this effect remains largely unknown. in the present study, otoacoustic emissions evoked by 60 db spl clicks were recorded in 19 normal-hearing subjects using the otodynamics il088, successively in absence and presence of a contralateral noise that was either steady or modulated sinusoidally in amplitude at different depths (from 25% to 100% in 25 point steps) and rates (from 50 hz to 800 hz in half-octave steps). the energy was kept constant whatever the modulation depth. the results showed that the evoked otoacoustic-emission attenuation effect induced by contralateral stimulation varied depending on the modulation depth and frequency of the contralateral amplitude-modulated noise. the largest suppression effect was observed at the 100 hz modulation frequency and the 100% modulation depth. the 50 hz modulation resulted in less suppression than with unmodulated noise. an interpretation of these results in terms of the influence of temporal amplitude fluctuations falling within a certain range on medial olivocochlear bundle activity is discussed.
the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein responses (upr(mt) and upr(er)) are important for cellular homeostasis during stimulus-induced increases in protein synthesis. exercise triggers the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, regulated in part by peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ coactivator 1α (pgc-1α). to investigate the role of the upr in exercise-induced adaptations, we subjected rats to 3 h of chronic contractile activity (cca) for 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 days followed by 3 h of recovery. mitochondrial biogenesis signaling, through pgc-1α mrna, increased 14-fold after 1 day of cca. this resulted in 10-32% increases in cytochrome c oxidase activity, indicative of mitochondrial content, between days 3 and 7, as well as increases in the autophagic degradation of p62 and microtubule-associated proteins 1a/1b light chain 3a (lc3)-ii protein. before these adaptations, the upr(er) transcripts activating transcription factor-4, spliced x-box-binding protein 1, and binding immunoglobulin protein were elevated (1.3- to 3.8-fold) at days 1-3, while ccaat/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (chop) and chaperones binding immunoglobulin protein and heat shock protein (hsp) 70 were elevated at mrna and protein levels (1.5- to 3.9-fold) at days 1-7 of cca. the mitochondrial chaperones 10-kda chaperonin, hsp60, and 75-kda mitochondrial hsp, the protease atp-dependent clp protease proteolytic subunit, and the regulatory protein sirtuin-3 of the upr(mt) were concurrently induced 10-80% between days 1 and 7 to test the role of the upr in cca-induced remodeling, we treated animals with the endoplasmic reticulum stress suppressor tauroursodeoxycholic acid and subjected them to 2 or 7 days of cca. tauroursodeoxycholic acid attenuated chop and hsp70 protein induction; however, this failed to impact mitochondrial remodeling. our data indicate that signaling to the upr is rapidly activated following acute contractile activity, that this is attenuated with repeated bouts, and that the upr is involved in chronic adaptations to cca; however, this appears to be independent of chop signaling. chronic contractile activity produces mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle. this adaptation results in a significant shift in adenine nucleotide metabolism, with attendant improvements in fatigue resistance. the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are derived from the nuclear genome, necessitating the transcription of genes, the translation of mrna into protein, the targeting of the protein to a mitochondrial compartment via the import machinery, and the assembly of multisubunit enzyme complexes in the respiratory chain or matrix. putative signals involved in initiating this pathway of gene expression in response to contractile activity likely arise from combinations of accelerations in atp turnover or imbalances between mitochondrial atp synthesis and cellular atp demand, and ca(2+) fluxes. these rapid events are followed by the activation of exercise-responsive kinases, which phosphorylate proteins such as transcription factors, which subsequently bind to upstream regulatory regions in dna, to alter transcription rates. contractile activity increases the mrna levels of nuclear-encoded proteins such as cytochrome c and mitochondrial transcription factor a (tfam) and mrna levels of upstream transcription factors like c-jun and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (nrf-1). mrna level changes are often most evident during the postexercise recovery period, and they can occur as a result of contractile activity-induced increases in transcription or mrna stability. tfam is imported into mitochondria and controls the expression of mitochondrial dna (mtdna). mtdna contributes only 13 protein products to the respiratory chain, but they are vital for electron transport and atp synthesis. contractile activity increases tfam expression and accelerates its import into mitochondria, resulting in increased mtdna transcription and replication. the result of this coordinated expression of the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes, along with poorly understood changes in phospholipid synthesis, is an expansion of the muscle mitochondrial reticulum. further understanding of 1) regulation of mtdna expression, 2) upstream activators of nrf-1 and other transcription factors, 3) the identity of mrna stabilizing proteins, and 4) potential of contractile activity-induced changes in apoptotic signals are warranted.
the protistan genus acanthamoeba is a free-living amoeba existing in various environments. within this protistan genus, there are some species recognized as potential human pathogens, which may cause granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, acanthamoeba keratitis and chronic granulomatous lesions of the skin. in this study, 211 water samples were collected from two watersheds in southern taiwan. we detected acanthamoeba based on the pcr amplification with a genus-specific primer pair and investigation of acanthamoeba in puzih river and kaoping river in southern taiwan. acanthamoeba species were detected in 34 (16.1%) samples. the presence or absence of acanthamoeba within the water samples showed significant difference with the levels of water temperature and total coliforms. the most frequently identified acanthamoeba genotype was t4 (n = 19), followed by t5 (n = 8), and then t15 (n = 3). genotype t6, t7/t8, t11 and t12 were all detected once. genotype t4, t5, t6, t11 and t15 of acanthamoeba are responsible for acanthamoeba keratitis and should be considered a potential health threat associated with human activities in environmental surface water watersheds. in this study, 14 isolates of acanthamoeba from both clinical and environmental sources belonging to seven different species were assayed for tolerance of high osmotic pressure, temperature tolerance, extracellular proteases, and cytopathic effects (cpe) on immortalized rabbit corneal epithelial cells. on the basis of the results, amoeba isolates were divided into pathogenic and nonpathogenic groups. ribosomal dna sequencing was performed on these isolates. phylogenetic relationships revealed that all the pathogenic strains tested clustered together as one group, while nonpathogenic strains clustered into other groups. sequence comparisons with previously published sequences determined that among the six new pathogenic isolates used in this study, five belong to t4 genotype and one to t11. this is the first report of a t11 genotype being found in acanthamoeba keratitis.
repeated exposure to psychostimulants induces locomotor sensitization and leads to persistent changes in the circuitry of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (da) system. g-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (girk; also known as kir3) channels mediate a slow ipsc and control the excitability of da neurons. repeated 5 d exposure to psychostimulants decreases the size of the gabab receptor (gababr)-activated girk currents (ibaclofen) in ventral tegmental area (vta) da neurons of mice, but the mechanism underlying this plasticity is poorly understood. here, we show that methamphetamine-dependent attenuation of gababr-girk currents in vta da neurons required activation of both d1r-like and d2r-like receptors. the methamphetamine-dependent decrease in gababr-girk currents in vta da neurons did not depend on a mechanism of dephosphorylation of the gabab r2 subunit found previously for other neurons in the reward pathway. rather, the presence of the girk3 subunit appeared critical for the methamphetamine-dependent decrease of gababr-girk current in vta da neurons. together, these results highlight different regulatory mechanisms in the learning-evoked changes that occur in the vta with repeated exposure to psychostimulants. significance statement exposure to addictive drugs such as psychostimulants produces persistent adaptations in inhibitory circuits within the mesolimbic dopamine system, suggesting that addictive behaviors are encoded by changes in the reward neural circuitry. one form of neuroadaptation that occurs with repeated exposure to psychostimulants is a decrease in slow inhibition, mediated by a gabab receptor and a potassium channel. here, we examine the subcellular mechanism that links psychostimulant exposure with changes in slow inhibition and reveal that one type of potassium channel subunit is important for mediating the effect of repeated psychostimulant exposure. dissecting out the components of drug-dependent plasticity and uncovering novel protein targets in the reward circuit may lead to the development of new therapeutics for treating addiction. single or repeated exposure to psychostimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine after postnatal week 3 leads to an enduring enhancement in the psychotomimetic responses elicited by a subsequent challenge of a stimulant in rodents. this behavioral sensitization phenomenon has been considered to be the neural consequences of stimulant-induced alterations in gene expression in the brain after a critical period of postnatal development. using a differential cloning technique, rna arbitrarily primed pcr, we have now identified from the rat neocortex a novel and developmentally regulated methamphetamine (map)-inducible gene mrt1 (map responsive transcript 1). mrt1 encodes two major types of pdz- and px-domains containing proteins of approximately 62 kda in size with different carboxy termini, mrt1a and mrt1b. the mrt1 mrnas for mrt1a, mrt1a, and for mrt1b, mrt1b, are predominantly expressed in various brain regions and the testes, respectively. acute map injection upregulated mrt1b expression in the neocortex after postnatal week 3 in a d1 receptor antagonist-sensitive manner without affecting mrt1a expression. this upregulation was mimicked by another stimulant, cocaine, whereas pentobarbital and d1 antagonist failed to change the mrt1b transcript levels. moreover, repeated daily treatment of map, but not map plus d1 antagonist, for 5 days caused an augmentation of the basal expression of mrt1b 2 and 3 weeks after the drug discontinuation. these late-developing, cocaine-crossreactive, d1 antagonist-sensitive and long-term regulations of mrt1b by map are similar to the pharmacological profiles of stimulant-induced behavioral sensitization, and therefore may be associated with the initiation and/or maintenance of the long-term neuronal adaptation.
cancer is the collective group of diseases distinguished by uninhibited growth and spread of abnormal cells. it often results in death if the spread is not controlled. most cancers are treated by surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormones, or immunotherapy. however, currently there are many issues with these forms of treatment, namely the lack of ability to consistently remove the entire tumor and the side effect of killing normal cells during the treatment process. therefore there has been an increased interest in targeted drug delivery to tumors to specifically kill cancer cells. we have developed a highly adaptable amphiphilic alternating copolymer system that self-assembles into micelles for therapeutic delivery applications in cancer. the synthetic scheme includes the enzymatic polymerization of multifunctional linker molecules (dimethyl 5-hydroxyisopthalate) with poly(ethylene glycol). this chemoenzymatic synthesis is much faster and more convenient than an entirely chemical synthesis. subsequent synthetic steps have been developed to attach ligands (for targeting), perfluorocarbons (f mr imaging), fluorescent dyes (nirf imaging), and radioiodine (nuclear imaging and radioimmunotherapy) to the backbone. attachment of hydrocarbon or perfluorocarbon sidechains provides amphiphilicity to produce the multimodal self-assembling micelles. additionally, encapsulation procedures for chemotherapeutic agents, doxorubicin and paclitaxel, have been established. these unique alternating copolymer micelle nanoparticles were designed as delivery vehicles targeted to human cancer cells expressing the underglycosylated mucin-1 antigen, which is found on almost all epithelial cell adenocarcinomas, by use of the peptide eppt or the folate receptor (fr) by use of folate. development of the synthetic schemes has been coupled with in vitro toxicity experiments using various cell viability assays to minimize the toxic effect of these copolymer structures. overall the polymers used in this study were largely non-toxic when studied in vitro. the non-toxic polymers were brought forward into drug delivery and uptake experiments. cell death due to doxorubicin increased with encapsulation in these alternating copolymers and increased slightly more with the addition of targeting ligand to the encapsulating polymer. encapsulating paclitaxel in polymer also increased cell death as compared to free drug. these results demonstrate that these alternating copolymers have had some success as drug delivery vehicles. other in vitro studies included the investigation of cellular uptake by i or h radioactive analysis and fluorescence confocal microscopy. microscopy images of the this work reports the design of polymer micelles with cross-linked ionic cores that display high stability. block ionomer complexes were utilized as a micellar template for the synthesis of the cross-linked micelles. such micelles represent hydrophilic nanospheres of core-shell morphology. the core comprises a network of the cross-linked polyanions, which is surrounded by the shell of hydrophilic peo chains.
the relative levels of mrnas for cathepsins b, d, h, l, and s in eight normal murine tissues and three murine melanoma variants, b16fl, b16-f10, and b16a, have been analyzed by rna dot blot and densitometry. a direct correlation was observed between the levels of cathepsin b mkna and the metastatic potentials of these three melanoma variants. the relative amount of cathepsin b mrna in bida, which is the melanoma variant with the highest metastatic potential, was at least 3 times greater than that found in any of the normal murine tissues surveyed. similar results were obtained in analyses of either solid tumors or of cultures of tumor cells, confirming that the tumor cells themselves were the source for the elevated expression of cathepsin b mrna. northern blot analysis revealed the presence of three cathepsin b tran scripts of 5.0,4.0, and 2.2 kilobases in the melanoma variants, while only the 2.2-kilobase transcript was seen in the normal murine tissues. con currently with the mrna analysis, enzyme assays for cathepsin b activity were also performed using synthetic peptide substrates. the assays revealed increased cathepsin b activities in the melanoma variants, corresponding well with the increased cathepsin b mrna levels, and in addition demonstrated that all three of the melanoma variants secreted a latent form of cathepsin b into conditioned medium, which could be activated by limited proteolysis with pepsin. the levels of the latent enzyme released by the murine melanoma variants correlated well with the levels of cathepsin b mrna and with the metastatic potentials as determined by spontaneous metastasis from a s.c. site. ascitic fluid of patients with primary liver cancer was shown to contain a latent thiol proteinase which can be activated by pepsin treatment or by autolysis at acidic environment. this enzyme resembles cathepsin b (ec 3.4.22.1) in many physical-chemical properties including substrate specificity, requirement for thiol activators and inhibition both by thiol blocking reagents and by peptidyl diazomethyl ketones, but has a higher molecular size even after activation. pepsin treatment and autolysis reduce its mr from 41 800 to 33 400 and 27 700, respectively, but all these forms are larger than human liver cathepsin b. the latent enzyme may be, therefore, an enzyme--inhibitor complex or an inactive precursor of cathepsin b due to an altered processing in golgi endoplasmatic reticulum-lysosome compartment.
somatic embryogenesis is a useful tool of plant breeding. in this context, a procedure for inducing somatic embryogenesis in prunus incisa leaf explants had been previously developed. the original in vitro protocol relies on picloram treatments and exposure to darkness as inductive conditions, the best frequency of embryogenesis being obtained on the second leaf (f2) exposed to 4 μm picloram during 30 days. the morphological and biochemical changes observed during somatic embryogenesis occur in response to alterations in gene expression regulation patterns. a molecular study was conducted in order to provide deeper insight into the fundamental biological factors involved in the induction of this process using a gene candidate strategy and semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. so far, no sequence data related to somatic embryogenesis has been available in cherry. in the present study, we cloned and sequenced cdna fragments of putative genes encoding auxin-binding protein, cell cycle regulator and somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase. time-course differential transcript accumulations were observed for all investigated genes in leaves or derived callus tissues during the observation period (first month of culture). their possible involvement in the sequential steps of the embryogenic pathway (dedifferentiation, cell proliferation, differentiation through somatic embryogenesis) is presented and discussed. the first somatic single cells of carrot hypocotyl explants having the competence to form embryos in the presence of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-d) were identified using semi-automatic cell tracking. these competent cells are present as a small subpopulation of enlarged and vacuolated cells derived from cytoplasm-rich and rapidly proliferating non-embryogenic cells that originate from the provascular elements of the hypocotyl. a search for marker genes to monitor the transition of somatic into competent and embryogenic cells in established suspension cell cultures resulted in the identification of a gene transiently expressed in a small subpopulation of the same enlarged single cells that are formed during the initiation of the embryogenic cultures from hypocotyl explants. the predicted amino acid sequence and in vitro kinase assays show that this gene encodes a leucine-rich repeat containing receptor-like kinase protein, designated somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase (serk). somatic embryos formed from cells expressing a serk promoter-luciferase reporter gene. during somatic embryogenesis, serk expression ceased after the globular stage. in plants, serk mrna could only be detected transiently in the zygotic embryo up to the early globular stage but not in unpollinated flowers nor in any other plant tissue. these results suggest that somatic cells competent to form embryos and early globular somatic embryos share a highly specific signal transduction chain with the zygotic embryo from shortly after fertilization to the early globular embryo.
questions what is the association between mobility and falls risk for people living in residential aged care? can the physical mobility scale discriminate between residents at risk of falling and those not at risk?   design prospective longitudinal observational study.   setting six residential aged care facilities in australia.   participants eighty-seven high- and low-level care permanent residents.   outcome measures the primary outcome measure was the number of falls in the six months after the initial mobility assessment. mobility of all participants was assessed using the physical mobility scale, which includes nine mobility items assessed on a 0-5 scale yielding a total score out of 45.   results during the six-month study period, 131 falls were reported. residents with mild mobility impairment (physical mobility scale total score 28-36) had the highest fall risk (hazard ratio = 1.98, 95% ci 1.30 to 3.03). residents with fully dependent mobility (physical mobility scale total score 0-9) had the lowest risk for falls (hr=0.05, 95% ci 0.01 to 0.32).   conclusion aged care residents with mild mobility impairment are at increased risk of falls and are an appropriate target for falls prevention strategies. although improving the mobility of residents with moderate to severe mobility impairment may enhance their independence and reduce their burden on staff, paradoxically this may also increase their risk of falls. when these residents improve enough to progress into a higher category of mobility, physiotherapists should be aware that this may increase the risk of falls and should consider instituting appropriate falls prevention strategies. objectives to assess the use of the voluntary step execution test to identify fallers.   design cross-sectional retrospective.   setting two self-care, residential facilities.   participants a total of 100 healthy old volunteers (mean age = 78.4 +/- 5.7).   measurements the study investigated the use of the voluntary step execution test to identify fallers under single and dual-task conditions. berg balance test (bbs) and timed get up and go (tug) were used to assess balance and gait function.   results there were no significant differences found between fallers and non-fallers in bbs and tug (50.5 +/- 4.6 versus 52.5 +/- 3.4 and 9.4 +/- 3.4 versus 7.98 +/- 2.3 respectively). there were no statistically significant differences between non-fallers and fallers across all step execution parameters under the single-task condition. however, adding cognitive load to the voluntary step execution test revealed statistically significant increases in duration of the preparatory phase, swing time and the time to foot-contact (p = 0.035;p = 0.033 and p = 0.037, respectively). based on the coefficients of the logistic regression model participants with dual-task step execution times of > or =1,100 ms had five times the risk of falling than participants with execution times of <1,100 ms.   conclusions the study provides evidence that a simple, safe measure of step execution under dual-task conditions can identify elderly individuals at risk for falls.
the purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the bond strength between fiber post and laser-treated root canals. forty single-rooted bovine teeth were endodontically treated and randomly divided into four groups of equal size according to the root canal treatment: group 1 conventional treatment (without laser irradiation); group 2 nd:yag laser (1.5 w, 10 hz, 100 mj); group 3 er,cr:ysgg laser (0.75 w, 20 hz); and group 4 nd:yag + er,cr:ysgg lasers. the fiber posts were cemented with an adhesive system + resin cement, in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. a mini acrylic pipe was fixed on the coronal section of the post using a light-polymerized resin. specimens were mounted on an acrylic pipe with a self-polymerized resin. retention forces were determined using a universal testing machine (0.5 mm/min). data were analyzed using one-way anova and tukey tests (p <0.05). the post retention force in group 2 was found to be lower than that in the other experimental groups. fractures were observed at the interface between the dentin and the resin in all groups. high-intensity lasers can be used in conventional endodontic treatment; however, root canal surface irradiation using the nd:yag laser was shown to negatively affect the post retention force. objective the aim of this study was to compare the antibacterial effectiveness of the nd:yag, the ho:yag, and the er:yag laser in infected root canals.   summary background data lasers are gaining increasing importance in the field of endodontics. numerous studies have shown the beneficial effects of laser treatment in disinfecting root canals.   methods in our in vitro experimental setup, 40 extracted and endodontically treated teeth were inoculated with a suspension of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and then irradiated at standardized power settings. the disinfecting efficacy of each laser was proved by classical microbiological examination.   results this article highlights that all three lasers substantially decreased the bacterial population with only minimal differences in their microbicidal efficacy. at 1.5 w, the best results were obtained by the er:yag laser achieving a mean bacterial elimination of 99.64%, followed by the nd:yag laser (99.16%), and the ho:yag laser (99.05%).   conclusion our findings indicate that all three lasers act as strongly effective microbicides without causing unfavorable temperature rises at the settings used. they can thus be considered a valuable tool for root canal treatment.
stomatogastric musculature from crabs in the genus cancer provides a system in which modulatory roles of peptides from the flrfamide family can be compared. the anterior cardiac plexus (acp) is a neuroendocrine release site within the cancer stomatogastric nervous system that is structurally identical in c. borealis, c. productus, and c. magister but that appears to contain flrfamide-like peptide(s) only in c. productus. we measured the effect of tnrnflrfamide on nerve-evoked contractions of muscles that were nearby, an intermediate distance, or far from the acp. we found the spatial pattern of flrfamidergic modulation of muscles in c. productus to be qualitatively different than in c. borealis or c. magister. in c. productus, muscles proximal to the acp were more responsive than distal muscles. in c. borealis, flrfamidergic response was less dependent on muscle location. these results suggest that functionally different roles of flrfamides in modulating stomatogastric muscle movements may have evolved in different cancer species. at least 10 different substances modulate the amplitude of nerve-evoked contractions of the gastric mill 4 (gm4) muscle of the crab, cancer borealis. serotonin, dopamine, octopamine, proctolin, red pigment concentrating hormone, crustacean cardioactive peptide, tnrnflrfamide, and sdrnflrfamide increased and -allatostatin-3 and histamine decreased the amplitude of nerve-evoked contractions. modulator efficacy was frequency dependent; tnrnflrfamide, proctolin, and allatostatin-3 were more effective when the motor neuron was stimulated at 10 hz than at 40 hz, whereas the reverse was true for dopamine and serotonin. the modulators that were most effective at high stimulus frequencies produced a significant decrease in muscle relaxation time; those that were most effective at low stimulus frequencies produced modest increases in relaxation time. thus modulator actions that appear redundant when examined only at one stimulus frequency are differentiated when a range of stimulus dynamics is studied. the effects of tnrnflrfamide, serotonin, proctolin, dopamine, and -allatostatin-3 on the amplitude and facilitation of nerve-evoked excitatory junctional potentials (ejps) in the gm4 and gastric mill 6 (gm6) muscles were compared. the ejps in gm4 have a large initial amplitude and show relatively little facilitation, whereas the ejps in gm6 have a small initial amplitude and show considerable facilitation. modulators that enhanced contractions also enhanced ejp amplitude; -allatostatin-3 reduced ejp amplitude. the effects of these modulators on ejp amplitude were modest and showed no significant frequency dependence. this suggests that the frequency dependence of modulator action on contraction results from effects on excitation-contraction coupling. the modulators affected facilitation at these junctions in a manner consistent with a change in release probability. they produced a change in facilitation that is inversely related to their action on ejp amplitude.
significant progress in understanding the effects of the neurotoxic action of lead (pb) in young organisms had led to reduction of “safe” level in the blood (pb-b) to 5 μg/dl in children and pregnant women. prolonged exposure to relatively low levels of pb, generally asymptomatic and subclinical (i.e., microintoxication), is currently the dominant form of environmental poisoning, and its negative effects on health may appear after many years, e.g., secondary contamination from pb bone deposits released in pregnancy. therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of environmental exposure (urban areas) of mothers to pb, on its levels in their milk and blood and in the blood of newborns. moreover, the aim was to determine the fatty acid profile in the mothers’ blood and milk and in the blood of newborns. we also wanted to find if infant birth weight depends on pb blood levels, as well as on pb and fatty acid levels in the blood and milk of the mothers. finally, we examined if the mothers’ weight and body mass index (bmi) before pregnancy influenced the concentration of pb and fatty acid profile in the blood and milk of mothers and in the blood of their children. analysis of fatty acids elaidic (c18:1, 9t), oleic (c18:1, 9c), vaccenic (c18:1, 11t), cis-vaccenic (c18:1, 11c), linoleic (c18:2, cis), γ-linolenic (c18:3, n-6), α-linolenic (c18:3, n-3), arachidonic (c20:4, n-6), eicosapentaenoic (c20:5, n-3), and docosahexaenoic (c22:6, n-3) was conducted by gas chromatography. the concentration of pb in the whole blood and milk were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with graphite furnace atomization and zeeman correction. our study established a significant and strong correlation between the content of pb in the blood of the mother and the child. this supports the assumption that the transport of pb through the placenta is neither regulated nor selective. environmental maternal exposure to lead resulting in pb-b levels considered safe for pregnant women had no effect on infant birth weight, the concentration of fatty acids in the blood and milk of mothers, or in the blood of newborns. mothers’ weight and bmi before pregnancy had no effect on the concentration of pb and studied fatty acid profile. abstract the fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesterol esters and nonesterified fatty acids was determined by high-resolution capillary gas-liquid chromatography in 41 pairs of mothers and their term infants at time of birth. the total free fatty acid content in maternal and cord plasma was positively correlated, possibly reflecting a passive, gradient dependent transplacental passage of nonesterified fatty acids. higher percentage values of several saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in cord than in maternal plasma phospholipids, triglycerides and nonesterified fatty acids may have resulted from an active fetal fatty acid synthesis. trans fatty acids were found in every lipid class at similar or slightly lower percentages in neonatal as in maternal plasma, thus confirming their placental passage. long-chain n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are preferentially incorporated into phospholipids and sterolesters of both maternal and cord plasma. linoleic and α-linolenic acids were found in smaller portions in cord than in maternal fatty acids, in contrast to strikingly higher proportions of their long-chain polyunsaturated metabolites, which may indicate a discriminating placental transport for certain physiologically important long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. conclusion the fetus appears to obtain fatty acids from a combination of de novo synthesis, a passive gradient dependent transplacental passage of nonesterified fatty acids and a selective materno-fetal placental transport for certain fatty acids, such as physiologically important long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.
the adolescent period in mammals is a critical period of brain maturation and thus represents a time of susceptibility to environmental insult, e.g. psychosocial stress and/or drugs of abuse, which may cause lasting impairments in brain function and behavior and even precipitate symptoms in at-risk individuals. one likely effect of these environmental insults is to increase oxidative stress in the developing adolescent brain. indeed, there is increasing evidence that redox dysregulation plays an important role in the development of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders and that gaba interneurons are particularly susceptible to alterations in oxidative stress. the current study sought to model this adolescent neurochemical "stress" by exposing mice to the dopamine transporter inhibitor gbr12909 (5mg/kg; ip) during adolescence (postnatal day 35-44) and measuring the resultant effect on locomotor behavior and probabilistic reversal learning as well as gabaergic interneurons and oxidative stress in adulthood. c57bl6/j mice exposed to gbr12909 showed increased activity in a novel environment and increased impulsivity as measured by premature responding in the probabilistic reversal learning task. adolescent gbr12909-exposed mice also showed decreased parvalbumin (pv) immunoreactivity in the prefrontal cortex, which was accompanied by increased oxidative stress in pv+ neurons. these findings indicate that adolescent exposure to a dopamine transporter inhibitor results in loss of pv in gabaergic interneurons, elevations in markers of oxidative stress, and alterations in behavior in adulthood. antibodies specific for the dopamine transporter (dat) was developed and characterized by immunoblot analysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry, and used for immunolocalization of transporter protein in rat brain at the light microscopic level. antibodies targeting the n-terminus, the second extracellular loop, and the c- terminus were generated from fusion proteins containing amino acid sequences from these respective regions. immunoblot analysis demonstrated that n-terminus and loop antibodies were specific for expressed cloned dat, recognized transporter protein in rat and human striatal membranes, and were sensitive to preabsorption with excess homologous fusion protein. immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that anti-dat antisera recognized solubilized, radiolabeled dat protein in a concentration-dependent manner. dat immunocytochemistry with these antibodies were also sensitive to preabsorption with fusion protein and to lesions of dopaminergic mesostriatal and mesocorticolimbic pathways. regional distribution of dat coincided with established dopaminergic innervation of several regions, including ventral mesencephalon, medial forebrain bundle, and dorsal and ventral striatum. however, certain mismatches between immunocytochemical distributions of dat and tyrosine hydroxylase were apparent, indicating that dopaminergic systems are heterogeneous and may use independent mechanisms for the regulation of dopamine levels in brain. the generation of specific dat antibodies will permit further characterization of the cellular and subcellular localization of dat protein, and of dopaminergic circuits in neurological and psychiatric disorders.
mechanisms that regulate the number of cell division rounds during embryogenesis have remained largely elusive. to investigate this issue, we used the ascidian, which develops into a tadpole larva with a small number of cells. the embryonic cells divide 11.45 times on average from fertilization to hatching. the number of cell division rounds varies depending on embryonic lineages. notochord and muscle consist of large postmitotic cells and stop dividing early in developing embryos. here we show that conversion of mesenchyme to muscle cell fates by inhibition of inductive fgf signaling or mis-expression of a muscle-specific key transcription factor for muscle differentiation, tbx6, changed the number of cell divisions in accordance with the altered fate. tbx6 likely activates a putative mechanism to halt cell division at a specific stage. however, precocious expression of tbx6 has no effect on progression of the developmental clock itself. zygotic expression of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, cki-b, is initiated in muscle and then in notochord precursors. cki-b is possibly downstream of tissue-specific key transcription factors of notochord and muscle. in the two distinct muscle lineages, postmitotic muscle cells are generated after 9 and 8 rounds of cell division depending on lineage, but the final cell divisions occur at a similar developmental stage. cki-b gene expression starts simultaneously in both muscle lineages at the 110-cell stage, suggesting that cki-b protein accumulation halts cell division at a similar stage. the difference in the number of cell divisions would be due to the cumulative difference in cell cycle length. these results suggest that muscle cells do not count the number of cell division rounds, and that accumulation of cki-b protein triggered by tissue-specific key transcription factors after cell fate determination might act as a kind of timer that measures elapsed time before cell division termination. differences in cell responsiveness to an inductive signal contribute to the emergence of a variety of tissue types during animal development. in ascidian embryos, the fibroblast growth factor (fgf) signal secreted from endoderm cells induces several different tissue types, such as notochord, mesenchyme and brain, at different positions in the embryo at the 32-cell stage. we show here in halocynthia roretzi that foxa and zic are required for notochord formation in cells that receive the fgf signal. we also show that these transcription factors, only when both are supplied, are able to induce ectopic expression of the brachyury gene, a notochord-specific marker, in cells of all the three germ layers in an fgf-dependent manner. these results suggest that foxa and zic confer notochord-specific responsiveness to fgf signaling. further analyses including knockdown and over-expression experiments showed that combinatorial inputs from maternally supplied and zigotically activated factors lead to overlapping expression of foxa and zic in the presumptive notochord cells, which eventually activate the expression of the brachyury gene in cooperation with fgf signaling. our data illustrate how a complex gene network specifies the notochord at its specific position within the embryo.
the cross domain collaborative filtering (cdcf) exploits the rating matrices from multiple domains to make better recommendations. existing cdcf methods adopt the substructure sharing technique that can only transfer linearly correlated knowledge between domains. in this paper, we propose the notion of hyper-structure transfer (hst) that requires the rating matrices to be explained by the projections of some more complex structure, called the hyper-structure, shared by all domains, and thus allows the nonlinearly correlated knowledge between domains to be identified and transferred. extensive experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our hst models empirically. recommender systems always aim to provide recommendations for a user based on historical ratings collected from a single domain (e.g., movies or books) only, which may suffer from the data sparsity problem. recently, several recommendation models have been proposed to transfer knowledge by pooling together the rating data from multiple domains to alleviate the sparsity problem, which typically assume that multiple domains share a latent common rating pattern based on the user-item co-clustering. in practice, however, the related domains do not necessarily share such a common rating pattern, and diversity among the related domains might outweigh the advantages of such common pattern, which may result in performance degradations. in this paper, we propose a novel cluster-level based latent factor model to enhance the cross-domain recommendation, which can not only learn the common rating pattern shared across domains with the flexibility in controlling the optimal level of sharing, but also learn the domain-specific rating patterns of users in each domain that involve the discriminative information propitious to performance improvement. to this end, the proposed model is formulated as an optimization problem based on joint nonnegative matrix tri-factorization and an efficient alternating minimization algorithm is developed with convergence guarantee. extensive experiments on several real world datasets suggest that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for the cross-domain recommendation task.
backgroundunsafe abortions are a serious public health problem and a major human rights issue. in low-income countries, where restrictive abortion laws are common, safe abortion care is not always available to women in need. health care providers have an important role in the provision of abortion services. however, the shortage of health care providers in low-income countries is critical and exacerbated by the unwillingness of some health care providers to provide abortion services. the aim of this study was to identify, summarise and synthesise available research addressing health care providers’ perceptions of and attitudes towards induced abortions in sub-saharan africa and southeast asia.methodsa systematic literature search of three databases was conducted in november 2014, as well as a manual search of reference lists. the selection criteria included quantitative and qualitative research studies written in english, regardless of the year of publication, exploring health care providers’ perceptions of and attitudes towards induced abortions in sub-saharan africa and southeast asia. the quality of all articles that met the inclusion criteria was assessed. the studies were critically appraised, and thematic analysis was used to synthesise the data.resultsthirty-six studies, published during 1977 and 2014, including data from 15 different countries, met the inclusion criteria. nine key themes were identified as influencing the health care providers’ attitudes towards induced abortions: 1) human rights, 2) gender, 3) religion, 4) access, 5) unpreparedness, 6) quality of life, 7) ambivalence 8) quality of care and 9) stigma and victimisation.conclusionshealth care providers in sub-saharan africa and southeast asia have moral-, social- and gender-based reservations about induced abortion. these reservations influence attitudes towards induced abortions and subsequently affect the relationship between the health care provider and the pregnant woman who wishes to have an abortion. a values clarification exercise among abortion care providers is needed. background we assessed whether the safety of first-trimester manual vacuum aspiration abortion done by health-care providers who are not doctors (mid-level providers) is equivalent to that of procedures done by doctors in south africa and vietnam, where mid-level providers are government trained and accredited to do first-trimester abortions.   methods we did a randomised, two-sided controlled equivalence trial to compare rates of complication in abortions done by the two groups of providers. an a-priori margin of equivalence of 4.5% with 80% power and 95% ci (alpha=0.05) was used. 1160 women participated in south africa and 1734 in vietnam. women presenting for an induced abortion at up to 12 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to a doctor or a mid-level provider for manual vacuum aspiration and followed-up 10-14 days later. the primary outcome was complication of abortion. complications were recorded during the abortion procedure, before discharge from the clinic, and at follow-up. per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses were done. this trial is registered at with the identifier .   findings in both countries, rates of complication satisfied the predetermined statistical criteria for equivalence: rates per 100 patients in south africa were 1.4 (eight of 576) for mid-level providers and 0 for doctors (difference 1.4, 95% ci 0.4 to 2.7); in vietnam, rates were 1.2 (ten of 824) for mid-level providers and 1.2 (ten of 812) for doctors (difference 0.0, 95% ci -1.2 to 1.1). there was one immediate complication related to analgesics. delayed complications were caused by retained products and infection.   interpretation with appropriate government training, mid-level health-care providers can provide first trimester manual vacuum aspiration abortions as safely as doctors can.
objective cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) is an inducible enzyme converting arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and playing important roles in inflammatory diseases as well as tumor development. previous studies investigating the association between cox-2 polymorphisms and colorectal cancer (crc) risk reported conflicting results. we performed a meta-analysis of all available studies to explore this association. methods all studies published up to october 2013 on the association between cox-2 polymorphisms and crc risk were identified by searching electronic databases pubmed, embase, and cochrane library. the association between cox-2 polymorphisms and crc risk was assessed by odds ratios (ors) together with their 95% confidence intervals (cis). results ten studies with 6,774 cases and 9,772 controls were included for −1195a>g polymorphism, 13 studies including 6,807 cases and 10,052 controls were available for −765g>c polymorphism, and 8 studies containing 5,121 cases and 7,487 controls were included for 8473t>c polymorphism. with respect to −765g>c polymorphism, we did not find a significant association with crc risk when all eligible studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. however, in subgroup analyses by ethnicity and cancer location, with a bonferroni corrected alpha of 0.05/2, statistical significant increased crc risk was found in the asian populations (dominant model cc+cg vs. gg: or = 1.399, 95%ci: 1.113–1.760, p = 0.004) and rectum cancer patients (cc vs. gg: or = 2.270, 95%ci: 1.295–3.980, p = 0.004; recessive model cc vs. cg+gg: or = 2.269, 95%ci: 1.297–3.970, p = 0.004). in subgroup analysis according to source of control, no significant association was detected. with respect to −1195a>g and 8473t>c polymorphisms, no significant association with crc risk was demonstrated in the overall and subgroup analyses. conclusions the present meta-analysis suggests that the cox-2 −765g>c polymorphism may be a risk factor for crc in asians and rectum cancer patients. further large and well-designed studies are needed to confirm this association. in this study, we aimed to investigate a possible association of the cox-2 polymorphisms (−765g→c and −1195a→g) and with the risk of developing epithelial ovarian carcinoma (eoc). cox-2 gene polymorphisms was investigated in 111 healthy women and 57 patients with eoc. individuals who had −765 cg, −1195 aa genotype, and −765 c allele had increased risk for ovarian carcinoma (p < 0.01) and individuals with −765 gg, −1195 ag genotypes and −1195 g allele seem to be protected from ovarian carcinoma (p < 0.01). haplotype analysis confirmed the association of cox-2 gene variants with ovarian carcinoma and revealed that the frequencies of −765c: −1195a haplotype frequencies was significantly higher in patients as compared with those of controls (p = 0.048). we state that there appears to be a modulating role for the cox-2 −1195a→g and −765g→c polymorphisms in the development of eoc. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show such an association.
we measured bacterial abundance and productivity, along with other biological, chemi- cal, and physical variables, during a 17 mo study in mobile bay, usa. mobile bay is a shallow, river- dominated estuary, with highly variable freshwater inputs and relatively short freshwater residence time (ca. 2 to 3 wk). in addition to the field measurements, we performed bioassay experiments to evaluate the degree of resource limitation of the bacterioplankton. as in other seasonally variable estuaries, temperature appeared to be an important regulator of bacterioplankton in mobile bay, with minima in abundance and growth rates occurring during winter. the bioassay experiments, in which an inoculum of the natural bacterioplankton community was diluted into filtered bay water and incubated for 4 d, always resulted in rapid net growth, indicating the presence of labile sub- strates. the net yield of bacterial cells in these assays was always equal to or greater than the abun- dance of in situ populations, suggesting that an amount of substrate about equal to in situ biomass di- vided by growth efficiency was present year round. during winter, the yields in the bioassays were highest, suggesting an accumulation of resources when bacterial growth was limited by temperature. the importance of algal and detrital food supplies to the planktonic food web of a highly disturbed, estuarine ecosystem was evaluated in response to declining zooplankton and fish populations. we assessed organic matter bioavailability among a diversity of habitats and hydrologic inputs over 2 years in san francisco estuary's sacramento–san joaquin river delta. results show that bioavailable dissolved organic carbon from external riverine sources supports a large component of ecosystem metabolism. however, bioavailable particulate organic carbon derived primarily from internal phytoplankton production is the dominant food supply to the planktonic food web. the relative importance of phytoplankton as a food source is surprising because phytoplankton production is a small component of the ecosystem's organic-matter mass balance. our results indicate that management plans aimed at modifying the supply of organic matter to riverine, estuarine, and coastal food webs need to incorporate the potentially wide nutritional range represented by different organic matter sources.
in this paper, we apply a statistically rigorous track-before-detect (tbd) method, the bernoulli particle filter, to actual imagery of resident space objects (rsos). robust methods in this realm will lead to better space domain awareness (sda) while reducing the cost of sensors and optics. we focus on estimating sensor-level kinematics of rsos for low signal-to-noise ratio (snr) short-arc observations. for four minute arcs of 29 images, targets with snr as low as 2.6983 are tracked to 3 arcsec accuracy in image plane position and 0.07 arcsec/sec in velocity. the objective of multi-object estimation is to simultaneously estimate the number of objects and their states from a set of observations in the presence of data association uncertainty, detection uncertainty, false observations, and noise. this estimation problem can be formulated in a bayesian framework by modeling the (hidden) set of states and set of observations as random finite sets (rfss) that covers thinning, markov shifts, and superposition. a prior for the hidden rfs together with the likelihood of the realization of the observed rfs gives the posterior distribution via the application of bayes rule. we propose a new class of rfs distributions that is conjugate with respect to the multiobject observation likelihood and closed under the chapman-kolmogorov equation. this result is tested on a bayesian multi-target tracking algorithm.
the concept that leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion (leca) is a major determinant of the tissue injury elicited by ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) is largely based on studies employing adhesion molecule-specific monoclonal antibodies. the objective of this study was to assess the contribution of leca to i/r injury using mutant mice (all on a c57b1 background) that are deficient in either intracellular adhesion molecule-1, p-selectin, or cd11/cd18. the accumulation of fluorescently labeled leukocytes and the number of nonperfused sinusoids in livers of control and adhesion molecule-deficient mice were monitored by intravital microscopy for 1 h after release of the occluded (for 15 min) superior mesenteric artery. autofluorescence of pyridine nucleotide (nadh) was measured as an indicator of mitochondrial o2 consumption and redox status. the number of stationary leukocytes in the liver after gut i/r was significantly elevated compared with baseline values in c57b1 (control) mice. autofluorescence of nadh was also significantly increased (indicating hypoxia) after i/r in these mice, especially in the pericentral region. intercellular adhesion molecule-1-, cd11/cd18-, and p-selectin-deficient mice all exhibited a blunted leukosequestration response to i/r and smaller increments in nonperfused sinusoids, relative to c57b1 mice. all adhesion molecule-deficient mice also exhibited an attenuated increment in nadh autofluorescence in the pericentral region, relative to control mice. these results from adhesion molecule-deficient mice provide additional support for the view that leca is an important determinant of the liver dysfunction induced by gut i/r. background & aims although it has been reported that gut ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) elicits neutrophil-dependent liver dysfunction, little is known about the kinetics of leukocyte accumulation in the hepatic microcirculation after gut i/r. the aim of this study was to determine the temporal relationship between leukocyte sequestration and oxidative stress in rat liver after occlusion (30 minutes) and reperfusion (60 minutes) of the superior mesenteric artery and assess the effects of neutrophil depletion or immunoneutralization of either intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) or the leukocyte adhesion glycoprotein cd11/cd18 on the hepatic microvascular responses to gut i/r.   methods leukocyte accumulation, number of nonperfused sinusoids, and autofluorescence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadh) were monitored using intravital videomicroscopy both before and after gut i/r.   results the number of adherent leukocytes in both midzonal and pericentral regions after gut i/r was elevated. autofluorescence of nadh increased after reperfusion (indicating hypoxia), particularly in the pericentral region. neutrophil depletion or antibodies to either icam-1 or cd11/cd18 blunted the gut i/r-induced increases in nadh autofluorescence in the pericentral region, leukocyte adherence, and nonperfused sinusoids.   conclusions leukocytes accumulate in the liver after gut i/r via interaction of cd11/cd18 and icam-1. the leukocytes appear to mediate an oxidative stress, occurring in proximity to nonperfused sinusoids, that may contribute to liver injury.
cancer-associated fibroblasts (cafs) support tumorigenesis by stimulating angiogenesis, cancer cell proliferation, and invasion. we demonstrate that cafs also mediate tumor-enhancing inflammation. using a mouse model of squamous skin carcinogenesis, we found a proinflammatory gene signature in cafs isolated from dysplastic skin. this signature was maintained in cafs from subsequent skin carcinomas and was evident in mammary and pancreatic tumors in mice and in cognate human cancers. the inflammatory signature was already activated in cafs isolated from the initial hyperplastic stage in multistep skin tumorigenesis. cafs from this pathway promoted macrophage recruitment, neovascularization, and tumor growth, activities that are abolished when nf-kappab signaling was inhibited. additionally, we show that normal dermal fibroblasts can be "educated" by carcinoma cells to express proinflammatory genes. we studied the role of nf-κb in acute inflammation caused by gut ischemia-reperfusion through selective ablation of iκb kinase (ikk)-β, the catalytic subunit of ikk that is essential for nf-κb activation. ablation of ikk-β in enterocytes prevented the systemic inflammatory response, which culminates in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (mods) that is normally triggered by gut ischemia-reperfusion. ikk-β removal from enterocytes, however, also resulted in severe apoptotic damage to the reperfused intestinal mucosa. these results show the dual function of the nf-κb system, which is responsible for both tissue protection and systemic inflammation, and underscore the caution that should be exerted in using nf-κb and ikk inhibitors.
electrophysiological recordings were used to explore the role of group ii and iii metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglurs) in oscillatory patterns generated by the neonatal rat spinal cord in vitro. neither the group ii agonist dcg-iv (and the selective antagonist eglu), nor the group iii agonist l-ap4 (and its selective antagonist cppg) had any effect on lumbar motoneuron membrane potential or input resistance. this observation suggests that motoneurons expressed no functional group ii and iii mglurs and received no network-based, tonic influence mediated by them. dcg-iv or l-ap4 strongly depressed synaptic responses evoked by single dorsal root (dr) stimuli, an effect counteracted by their respective antagonist. eglu or cppg per se had no effect on synaptic responses, indicating no mglur autoreceptor-dependent control of transmitter release. l-ap4 largely depressed cumulative depolarization, windup and associated oscillations, whereas synaptic depression induced by dcg-iv waned with repeated stimuli. l-ap4 slowed down fictive locomotor patterns and arrested disinhibited bursting, which could, however, be promptly restored by dr electrical stimulation. dcg-iv had no significant effect on fictive locomotion, but it blocked disinhibited bursting. eglu facilitated bursting, suggesting that burst termination was partly controlled by group ii mglurs. all these effects were reversible on washout. it is concluded that activation of group ii and iii mglurs differentially modulated rhythmic patterns recorded from motoneurons via network-dependent actions, which probably included decrease in the release of neurotransmitters at key circuit points. intracellular recording from rat lumbar motoneurones showed that patterned electrical stimulation of one dorsal root induced alternating patterns typical of fictive locomotion, accompanied by a reduction in the antidromic spike afterhyperpolarization (ahp). since the ahp depended linearly on extracellular k(+) ([k(+)](o)), from the ahp fall we calculated that [k(+)](o) rose to 7.9+/-0.4 mm, a value within the 7-10 mm range known to elicit fictive locomotion. to confirm the specificity of this approach we also tested concentrations of n-methyl-d-aspartate (2 microm) below threshold for fictive locomotion, and we observed that, despite strong excitation, the estimated [k(+)](o) was 6 mm, i.e. outside the range for fictive locomotion. we suggest that synaptic activity induced by a certain pattern of electrical stimulation of afferent fibres evoked persistent elevation in [k(+)](o) which triggered the locomotor network to generate rhythmic patterns.
aurora-a, a centrosome-localized serine/threonine kinase, is over-expressed in multiple human cancers. we previously reported zhang et al. (biochem biophys res commun 2007, 357:347–352) intramolecular inhibitory regulation of aurora-a between its n-terminal (nt) regulatory domain (amino acids 1–128, nt) and c-terminal catalytic domain (aa 129–403, cd). here, we identified two essential sites located on the nt of aurora-a (lys 99 and lys 119) and demonstrate that mutation of either residue to gly could cause the nt and c-terminal lobes of the catalytic domain in aurora-a to form a closed conformation, resulting in a loss of kinase activity. this inactive conformation was reversed by adding c26 peptide (274–299) or ajuba, which is a required activator of aurora-a. over-expression of either mutant induced g2/m arrest. these results provide a basis for future anti-cancer studies targeting aurora-a. aurora-a is a centrosome-localized serine/threonine kinase that is overexpressed in multiple human cancers. here, we report an intramolecular inhibitory regulation in aurora-a between its n-terminal regulatory domain (aa 1-128, nt) and the c-terminal catalytic domain (aa 129-403, cd). removal of nt results in a significant increase in kinase activity. nt inhibited the activity of the single c-terminal kinase domain, but had little effect on the activity of the full-length of aurora-a. pp1 is not involved in this regulation, instead, nt interacts cd directly in vitro and in vivo. the non-aurora box (aa 64-128) in the n-terminal negatively regulated the kinase activity of the c-terminal kinase domain by intramolecular interaction with aa 240-300 within the c-terminal.
sugars are important nutrients for many animals, but are also proposed to contribute to overnutrition-derived metabolic diseases in humans. understanding the genetic factors governing dietary sugar tolerance therefore has profound biological and medical significance. paralogous mondo transcription factors chrebp and mondoa, with their common binding partner mlx, are key sensors of intracellular glucose flux in mammals. here we report analysis of the in vivo function of drosophila melanogaster mlx and its binding partner mondo (chrebp) in respect to tolerance to dietary sugars. larvae lacking mlx or having reduced mondo expression show strikingly reduced survival on a diet with moderate or high levels of sucrose, glucose, and fructose. mlx null mutants display widespread changes in lipid and phospholipid profiles, signs of amino acid catabolism, as well as strongly elevated circulating glucose levels. systematic loss-of-function analysis of mlx target genes reveals that circulating glucose levels and dietary sugar tolerance can be genetically uncoupled: krüppel-like transcription factor cabut and carbonyl detoxifying enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase type iii are essential for dietary sugar tolerance, but display no influence on circulating glucose levels. on the other hand, phosphofructokinase 2, a regulator of the glycolysis pathway, is needed for both dietary sugar tolerance and maintenance of circulating glucose homeostasis. furthermore, we show evidence that fatty acid synthesis, which is a highly conserved mondo-mlx-regulated process, does not promote dietary sugar tolerance. in contrast, survival of larvae with reduced fatty acid synthase expression is sugar-dependent. our data demonstrate that the transcriptional network regulated by mondo-mlx is a critical determinant of the healthful dietary spectrum allowing drosophila to exploit sugar-rich nutrient sources. the paralogous transcription factors chrebp and mondoa, together with their common binding partner mlx, have emerged as key mediators of intracellular glucose sensing. by regulating target genes involved in glycolysis and lipogenesis, they mediate metabolic adaptation to changing glucose levels. as disturbed glucose homeostasis plays a central role in human metabolic diseases and as cancer cells often display altered glucose metabolism, better understanding of cellular glucose sensing will likely uncover new therapeutic opportunities. here we review the regulation, function and evolutionary conservation of the chrebp/mondoa-mlx glucose sensing system and discuss possible directions for future research.
background: anthraquinones are a possible treatment option for oncological patients due to their anti-cancer properties. cancer patients often exhaust a plethora of resources that ultimately fail to provide fully curative measures. alternative treatments are subsequently sought in the hope of finding a therapeutic remedy. po¬tential regimens include aloe-emodin and its related derivatives. this review therefore summarizes the effects of aloe-emodin and other aloe components in light of their anti-proliferative and anti-carcinogenic properties. methods: a systematic search was performed in pubmed for aloe-emodin and cancer in humans. sixty abstracts of in vitrostudies were selected and reviewed with subsequent screening of the full text. thirty-eight articles were summarized. results: aloe-emodin possesses multiple anti-proliferative and anti-carcinogenic properties in a host of human cancer cell lines, with often multiple vital pathways affected by the same molecule. the most notable effects include inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; cycle arrest; induction of cell death; mitochondrial membrane and redox perturbations; and modulation of immune signaling. the effects of aloe-emodin are not ubiquitous across all cell lines but depend on cell type. conclusions: on the basis of this systematic review, the multiple consistent effects of aloe-emodin in hu¬man-derived cancer cell lines suggest that aloe-emodin is a potential anti-cancer agent that acts on cancer cells in a pleiotropic manner. relevance for patients: cancer patients often utilize alternative therapies as a result of suboptimal efficacy of conventional treatments. aloe-emodin might become a therapeutic option for cancer patients if the basic research is confirmed in clinical trials. aloe-emodin (1,8-dihydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-anthraquinone) is an active component from the root and rhizome of rheum palmatum. the study investigated the effects and mechanisms of aloe-emodin-induced cell death in human lung squamous cell carcinoma cell line ch27. aloe-emodin (40 microm)-induced ch27 cell apoptosis was confirmed by dna fragmentation (dna ladders and sub-g(1) formation). aloe-emodin-induced apoptosis of ch27 cells involved modulation of the expression of bcl-2 family proteins, such as bclx(l), bag-1, and bak, and was associated with the translocation of bak and bax from cytosolic to particulate fractions. aloe-emodin-treated ch27 cells had an increased relative abundance of cytochrome c in the cytosolic fraction. results demonstrated that the activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 is an important determinant of apoptotic death induced by aloe-emodin. these results suggest that aloe-emodin induces ch27 cell death by the bax and fas death pathway.
to thrive in the acidic vaginal tract, candida glabrata has to cope with high concentrations of acetic acid. the mechanisms underlying c. glabrata tolerance to acetic acid at low ph remain largely uncharacterized. in this work, the essential role of the cghaa1 transcription factor (encoded by orf cagl0l09339g) in the response and tolerance of c. glabrata to acetic acid is demonstrated. transcriptomic analysis showed that cghaa1 regulates, directly or indirectly, the expression of about 75% of the genes activated under acetic acid stress. cghaa1-activated targets are involved in multiple physiological functions including membrane transport, metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids, regulation of the activity of the plasma membrane h+-atpase, and adhesion. under acetic acid stress, cghaa1 increased the activity and the expression of the cgpma1 proton pump and contributed to increased colonization of vaginal epithelial cells by c. glabrata. cghaa1, and two identified cghaa1-activated targets, cgtpo3 and cghsp30, are herein demonstrated to be determinants of c. glabrata tolerance to acetic acid. the protective effect of cgtpo3 and of cghaa1 was linked to a role of these proteins in reducing the accumulation of acetic acid inside c. glabrata cells. in response to acetic acid stress, marked differences were found in the regulons controlled by cghaa1 and by its s. cerevisiae schaa1 ortholog, demonstrating a clear divergent evolution of the two regulatory networks. the results gathered in this study significantly advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the success of c. glabrata as a vaginal colonizer. saccharomyces cerevisiae has a single integral plasma membrane heat shock protein (hsp). this hsp30 is induced by several stresses, including heat shock, ethanol exposure, severe osmostress, weak organic acid exposure and glucose limitation. plasma membrane h(+)-atpase activities of heat shocked and weak acid-adapted, hsp30 mutant and wild-type cells, revealed that hsp30 induction leads to a downregulation of the stress-stimulation of this h(+)-atpase. plasma membrane h(+)-atpase activity consumes a substantial fraction of the atp generated by the cell, a usage that will be increased by the h(+)-atpase stimulation occurring with several hsp30-inducing stresses. hsp30 might therefore provide an energy conservation role, limiting excessive atp consumption by plasma membrane h(+)-atpase during prolonged stress exposure or glucose limitation. consistent with the role of hsp30 being energy conservation, hsp30 null cultures give lower final biomass yields. they also have lower atp levels, consistent with higher h(+)-atpase activity, at the glucose exhaustion stage of batch fermentations (diauxic lag), when hsp30 is normally induced. loss of hsp30 does not affect several stress tolerances but it extends the time needed for cells to adapt to growth under several stressful conditions where the maintenance of homeostasis will demand an unusually high usage of energy, hsp30 is the first yeast gene identified as both weak organic acid-inducible and assisting the adaptation to growth in the presence of these acids.
chlamydia trachomatis imposes serious health problems and causes infertility. because of asymptomatic onset, it often escapes antibiotic treatment. therefore, vaccines offer a better option for the prevention of unwanted inflammatory sequelae. the existence of serologically distinct serovars of c. trachomatis suggests that a vaccine will need to provide protection against multiple serovars. chlamydia spp. use a highly conserved type iii secretion system (t3ss) composed of structural and effector proteins which is an essential virulence factor. in this study, we expressed the t3ss needle protein of chlamydia muridarum, tc_0037, an ortholog of c. trachomatis cdsf, in a replication-defective adenoviral vector (adtc_0037) and evaluated its protective efficacy in an intravaginal chlamydia muridarum model. for better immune responses, we employed a heterologous prime-boost immunization protocol in which mice were intranasally primed with adtc_0037 and subcutaneously boosted with recombinant tc_0037 and toll-like receptor 4 agonist monophosphoryl lipid a mixed in a squalene nanoscale emulsion. we found that immunization with tc_0037 antigen induced specific humoral and t cell responses, decreased chlamydia loads in the genital tract, and abrogated pathology of upper genital organs. together, our results suggest that tc_0037, a highly conserved chlamydial t3ss protein, is a good candidate for inclusion in a chlamydia vaccine. chlamydia trachomatis sexually transmitted infections cause considerable morbidity and socioeconomic burden worldwide, despite significant advances in our understanding of the biology (29, 31, 57), pathogenesis (11, 83, 117), genomics (94), and epidemiology (91) of this parasite. chlamydial urogenital tract infections are readily cured with antibiotics, but control measures based on antimicrobial chemotherapy alone are hampered by the frequency of asymptomatic infections and delayed diagnosis (9). definitive control of c. trachomatis sexually transmitted diseases (stds) is possible through the development of a safe and efficacious vaccine (24). progress toward the development of an effective vaccine has been disappointingly modest, as it has been for vaccines to other sexually transmitted pathogens that infect the genital tract mucosae. the strict tropism for mucosal epithelial cells, the complex biology and antigenic structure, and the predilection to cause persistent infection have presented formidable challenges to chlamydial vaccine development. a heightened understanding of protective immunity to c. trachomatis urogenital infection has emerged in the past decade from studies using a mouse model of chlamydial genital tract infection. the insights are of considerable interest because they offer promise for the development of an efficacious chlamydial vaccine. this review focuses on that progress and summarizes the current understanding of protective immune mechanisms that function against murine chlamydial urogenital infection. we also discuss specific requirements for a vaccine to protect against chlamydial stds and the challenges presently confronting us in achieving that goal.
extracellular nucleotides atp, adp, amp and adenosine are well known signaling molecules of the cardiovascular system that are involved in several physiological processes: cell proliferation, platelet aggregation, inflammatory processes and vascular tonus. the levels of these molecules are controlled by ecto-ntpdases and ecto-5′-nucleotidase/cd73 (ecto-5′-nt/cd73) actions, which are responsible for the complete atp degradation to adenosine. the thyroid hormones, thyroxine (t4) and triiodothyronine (t3), play important roles in the vascular system promoting vasodilatation. here we investigated the influence of thyroid hormones on the enzyme cascade that catalyzes the interconversion of purine nucleotides in vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmc). exposure of vsmcs to 50nm t3 or t4 did not change atp and adp hydrolysis significantly. however, the same treatment caused an increase of 75% in amp hydrolysis, which was time-dependent but dose-independent. moreover, t3 treatment significantly increased ecto-5′-nt/cd73 mrna expression, which suggests a genomic effect of this hormone upon ecto-5′-nt/cd73. in addition to the importance of the ecto-5′-nt in cell proliferation and differentiation, its overexpression could result in higher extracellular levels of adenosine, an important local vasodilatator molecule. sympathetically innervated smooth muscles, including those in some arteries, arterioles, cat nictitating membrane and vas deferens, have α 1 -adrenoceptors which respond to exogenously applied noradrenaline (na) by producing contractions which can be abolished by α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists such as prazosin. stimulation of the sympathetic nerves innervating these muscles causes release of na and a contractile response. however, this contraction is (at least partly) resistant to specific α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists. this apparent contradiction could be explained by a variety of ad hoc explanations (such as high transmitter concentrations within the nerve-muscle junction, or prejunctional enhancement of transmitter release by the antagonist due to prejunctional α 2 -adrenoceptor blockade etc.) but recently two hypotheses have been advanced which may have more fundamental implications for sympathetic neurotransmission. first, hirst and neild and their colleagues suggested that the electrical and mechanical responses of some smooth muscles were resistant to α-adrenoceptor antagonists because neuronally released na was acting not only on α-adrenoceptors but also on a new class of adrenoceptors which they designated γ-receptors, located near the nerve-muscle junction. the crucial experiments in support of this hypothesis were originally performed on the arterioles of the guinea-pig submucosa [1], but the idea has been extended to include many other sympathetically innervated smooth muscles [2], including guinea-pig vas deferens, which was also the smooth muscle preparation in which the experimental evidence for an alternative hypothesis was obtained by fedan et al. [3]. they proposed that the α-blocker-resistant portion of the contractile response to sympathetic nerve stimulation was mediated by atp, acting as a cotransmitter with na. full details of the early development of the concept of cotransmission in sympathetic nerves have been reviewed previously [4, 6, 7]. the experimental evidence relating to the co-transmission hypothesis is outlined below, drawing mainly on results obtained in guinea-pig vas deferens, where most of the more recent experiments have been performed.
significance metabolic engineering is an economically feasible and sustainable alternative for the production of natural products, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, flavors, and fragrances. of the model systems used to demonstrate and develop this approach, the anticancer agent taxol stands out for its structural complexity and therapeutic value. a major challenge for the biosynthesis of taxol and many other natural products is the involvement of cytochrome p450-mediated oxygenation. p450 enzymes are intransigent to functional heterologous expression, especially in escherichia coli, leading many laboratories to abandon this organism when engineering p450-containing pathways. here, through a series of optimizations, we demonstrate e. coli as a viable host for p450-mediated oxidative chemistry, advancing taxol’s biosynthesis through a fivefold increase in oxygenated terpene titers. recent advances in metabolic engineering have demonstrated the potential to exploit biological chemistry for the synthesis of complex molecules. much of the progress to date has leveraged increasingly precise genetic tools to control the transcription and translation of enzymes for superior biosynthetic pathway performance. however, applying these approaches and principles to the synthesis of more complex natural products will require a new set of tools for enabling various classes of metabolic chemistries (i.e., cyclization, oxygenation, glycosylation, and halogenation) in vivo. of these diverse chemistries, oxygenation is one of the most challenging and pivotal for the synthesis of complex natural products. here, using taxol as a model system, we use nature’s favored oxygenase, the cytochrome p450, to perform high-level oxygenation chemistry in escherichia coli. an unexpected coupling of p450 expression and the expression of upstream pathway enzymes was discovered and identified as a key obstacle for functional oxidative chemistry. by optimizing p450 expression, reductase partner interactions, and n-terminal modifications, we achieved the highest reported titer of oxygenated taxanes (∼570 ± 45 mg/l) in e. coli. altogether, this study establishes e. coli as a tractable host for p450 chemistry, highlights the potential magnitude of protein interdependency in the context of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and points to a promising future for the microbial synthesis of complex chemical entities. protein engineering of cytochrome p450 monooxygenases (p450s) has been very successful in generating valuable non-natural activities and properties, allowing these powerful catalysts to be used for the synthesis of drug metabolites and in biosynthetic pathways for the production of precursors of artemisinin and paclitaxel. collected experience indicates that the p450s are highly 'evolvable' - they are particularly robust to mutation in their active sites and readily accept new substrates and exhibit new selectivities. their ability to adapt to new challenges upon mutation may reflect the nonpolar nature of their active sites as well as their high degree of conformational variability.
background primary liver and biliary cancers are very aggressive tumors. surgical treatment is the main option for cure or long term survival. the main purpose of this systematic review is to underline the indications for portal vein embolization (pve), in patients with inadequate future liver remnant (flr) and to analyze other parameters such as resection rate, morbidity, mortality, survival after pve and hepatectomy for primary hepatobiliary tumors. also the role of trans-arterial chemoembolization (tace) before pve, is investigated.   methods a systematic search of the literature was performed in pub med and the cochrane library from 01.01.1990 to 30.09.2015.   results forty articles were selected, including 2144 patients with a median age of 61 years. the median excision rate was 90% for hepatocellular carcinomas (hccs) and 86% for hilar cholangiocarcinomas (hcs). the main indications for pve in patients with hcc and presence of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis was flr <40% when liver function was good (icgr15 < 10%) and flr < 50% when liver function was affected (icgr15:10-20%). the combination of tace and pve increased hypertrophy rate and was associated with better overall survival and disease free survival and should be considered in advanced hcc tumors with inadequate flr. in patients with hcs pve was performed, after preoperative biliary drainage, when flr was <40%, in the majority of studies, with very good post-operative outcome. however indications should be refined.   conclusion pve before major hepatectomy allows resection in a patient group with advanced primary hepato-biliary tumors and inadequate flr, with good long term survival. the aim of this study is to identify the efficacy of portal vein embolization (pve) before right hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) with regard to hepatic function, surgical stress, and survival benefit.
benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) is a common, chronic progressive disease. inflammation is associated with prostatic enlargement and resistance to 5α‐reductase inhibitor (5ari) therapy. activation of the nuclear factor‐kappa b (nf‐κb) pathway is linked to both inflammation and ligand‐independent prostate cancer progression. the metabolic syndrome is common in countries with western lifestyles. it comprises a number of disorders—including insulin resistance, hypertension and obesity—that all act as risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. urological diseases have also been linked to the metabolic syndrome. most established aspects of the metabolic syndrome are linked to benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and prostate cancer. fasting plasma insulin, in particular, has been linked to bph and incident, aggressive and lethal prostate cancer. the metabolic syndrome has also been shown to be associated with nonprostatic urological conditions such as male hypogonadism, nephrolithiasis, overactive bladder and erectile dysfunction, although data on these conditions are still sparse. overall, the results of studies on urological aspects of the metabolic syndrome seem to indicate that bph and prostate cancer could be regarded as two new aspects of the metabolic syndrome, and that an increased insulin level is a common underlying aberration that promotes both bph and clinical prostate cancer. urologists need to be aware of the effect that the metabolic syndrome has on urological disorders and should transfer this knowledge to their patients.
backgroundandrogens are known to delay lung development. as a consequence, the incidence and morbidity of respiratory distress syndrome of the neonate are higher for male than for female premature infants. we previously reported that many genes were expressed with a sex difference in the mouse developing lung and that several genes were under the control of androgens in the male fetal lung. micrornas are small non-coding rnas known to negatively regulate the expression of specific genes. in this study, we examined whether murine mirnas are under the control of androgens in the male developing lung.methodsexpression profiling of micrornas was performed by microarrays using rna extracted from male fetal lungs isolated on gestational day (gd) 17.0 and gd 18.0 after daily injection of pregnant mice from gd 10.0 with the antiandrogen flutamide or vehicle only. to identify putative mirna target genes, the data obtained here were combined with gene profiling data reported previously using the same rna preparations. qpcr was used to confirm microarray data with fetal lungs from other litters than those used in microarrays.resultsflutamide induced downregulation and upregulation of several mirnas on gd 17.0 and gd 18.0. of the 43 mature mirnas modulated by flutamide on gd 17.0, 60 % were downregulated, whereas this proportion was only of 34 % for the 35 mature mirnas modulated on gd 18.0. for 29 and 26 flutamide-responsive mirnas, we found a corresponding target inversely regulated by androgens on gd 17.0 and 18.0, respectively. the androgen-regulated target genes were involved in several biological processes (lipid metabolism, cell proliferation, and lung development) and molecular functions, mainly transcription factor binding.conclusionsregulation of male lung development involves several mirnas that are under androgen modulation in vivo. aberrant wnt signalling promotes oncogenesis by increasing the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin to activate downstream target genes. however, the mechanism of β-catenin recruitment to the wnt target-gene promoter, a critical step for removing the co-repressor complex, is largely unknown. here, we report that transducin β-like protein 1 (tbl1) and its highly related family member tblr1 were required for wnt–β-catenin-mediated transcription. wnt signalling induced the interaction between β-catenin and tbl1–tblr1, as well as their binding to wnt target genes. importantly, the recruitment of tbl1–tblr1 and β-catenin to wnt target-gene promoters was mutually dependent on each other. furthermore, the depletion of tbl1–tblr1 significantly inhibited wnt–β-catenin-induced gene expression and oncogenic growth in vitro and in vivo. our results unravel two new components required for nuclear β-catenin function, and have important implications in developing new strategies for inhibiting wnt–β-catenin-mediated tumorigenesis.
abstract regulation of gene expression at the level of mrna stability is a major topic of research; however, knowledge about the regulatory mechanisms affecting the binding and function of au-rich element (are)-binding proteins (aubps) in response to extracellular signals is minimal. the β1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (β4galt1) gene enabled us to study the mechanisms involved in binding of tristetraprolin (ttp) as the stability of its mrna is regulated solely through one are bound by ttp in resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells. here, we provide evidence that the complex formation of ttp with 14-3-3β is required to bind β4galt1 mrna and promote its decay. furthermore, upon tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulation, the activation of both iκβ kinase and protein kinase cδ is involved in the phosphorylation of 14-3-3β on two serine residues, paralleled by release of binding of ttp and 14-3-3β from β4galt1 mrna, nuclear sequestration of ttp, and β4galt1 mrna stabilization. thus, a key mechanism regulating mrna binding and function of the destabilizing aubp ttp involves the phosphorylation status of 14-3-3β. tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf alpha) is a multifunctional cytokine belonging to a family of ligands with an associated family of receptor proteins. the pleiotropic actions of tnf range from proliferative responses such as cell growth and differentiation, to inflammatory effects and the mediation of immune responses, to destructive cellular outcomes such as apoptotic and necrotic cell death mechanisms. activated tnf receptors mediate the association of distinct adaptor proteins that regulate a variety of signalling processes including kinase or phosphatase activation, lipase stimulation, and protease induction. moreover, the cytokine regulates the activities of transcription factors, heterotrimeric or monomeric g-proteins and calcium ion homeostasis in order to orchestrate its cellular functions. this review addresses the structural basis of tnf signalling, the pathways employed with their cellular consequences, and focuses on the specific role played by each of the two tnf receptor isotypes, tnfr1 and tnfr2.
a‐ and c‐type lamins are intermediate filament proteins responsible for the maintenance of nuclear shape and most likely nuclear architecture. here, we propose that pronounced invaginations of a/c‐type lamins into the nuclear interior represent channels for the transport of regulatory molecules to and from nuclear and nucleolar regions. using fluorescent protein technology and immunofluorescence, we show that a‐type lamin channels interact with several nuclear components, including fibrillarin‐ and ubf‐positive regions of nucleoli, foci of heterochromatin protein 1 β, polycomb group bodies, and genomic regions associated with dna repair. similar associations were observed between a/c‐type lamin channels and nuclear pores, lamin‐associated protein lap2α, and promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. interestingly, regions with high levels of a/c‐type lamins had low levels of b‐type lamins, and vice versa. these characteristics were observed in primary and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts as well as human and mouse embryonic stem cell colonies exhibiting stem cell‐specific lamin positivity. our findings indicate that internal channels formed by nuclear lamins likely contribute to normal cellular processes through association with various nuclear and nucleolar structures. j. cell. biochem. 115: 476–487, 2014. © 2013 wiley periodicals, inc. the specificity of eukaryotic dna organization into loops fixed to the nuclear matrix/chromosomal scaffold has been studied for more than fifteen years. the results and conclusions of different authors remain, however, controversial. recently, we have elaborated a new approach to the study of chromosomal dna loops. instead of characterizing loop basements (nuclear matrix dna), we have concentrated our efforts on the characterization of individual loops after their excision by dna topoisomerase ii‐mediated dna cleavage at matrix attachment sites. in this review the results of applying this mapping approach are compared with the results and conclusions from studies of nuclear matrix dna. an attempt is also made to reconsider all data about the specificity of dna interactions with the nuclear matrix and to suggest a model of spatial organization of the eukaryotic genome which resolves apparent contradictions between these data.
introduction. it was found that vitamin d may have a direct effect on adipocyte differentiation and metabolism and might be involved in the glucose regulation of insulin secretion, as suggested from the discovery of a nuclear localization of 1,25-(oh)2d3 in pancreatic islets. in recent years, several polymorphisms in the vdr gene which are able to alter the activity of vdr protein have been described. the bsmi and foki polymorphisms were described in relation to obesity and type 2 diabetes. the aim of the study was to find whether there are associations between bsmi and foki polymorphisms and anthropometric (bmi, whr, bp) and biochemical parameters describing metabolic syndrome. materials and methods. studied were 176 randomly selected men aged 25–65 years (mean: 51.99 years) with a mean bmi of 28.06 kg/m2. two polymorphisms of the vdr gene (foki and bsmi) were explored using the pcr-rflp method. serum glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, ldl, hdl, and tg were measured using commercially available kits. results. it was found that bb carriers tend to have higher bmi (29.00 ± 3.74 versus 26.81 ± 3.76, p = 0.024) and waist circumference (101.79 ± 10.59 versus 96.23 ± 10.35, p = 0.014) compared with the bb genotypes. similarly, ff and ff carriers had higher fasting insulin levels than the ff genotypes (12.30 ± 10.26 versus 9.76 ± 5.88, p = 0.001 and 9.76 ± 5.88 vs. 6.35 ± 2.64, p = 0.008), and lover chdl levels in comparison to ff genotypes (52.28 ± 10.02 versus 60.63 ± 16.58, p = 0.015 and 53.70 ± 12.03 versus 60.63 ± 16.58, p = 0.032. besides these, no significant differences were found. conclusions. the bsmi vdr polymorphism seems to influence bmi, while the foki vdr polymorphism appears to affect insulin sensitivity and serum chdl level. vitamin d receptor (vdr) polymorphism influences susceptibility to type 1 diabetes, but the association with type 2 diabetes is not clear. we investigated the association between vdr polymorphism and type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in a community-based study of unrelated older adults without known diabetes. oral glucose tolerance test (75 g), plasma glucose and insulin measurement, homeostasis model assessment (homa), and vdr genotyping were performed. the distributions of genotype frequencies of apai, bsmi, and taqi polymorphism did not differ between persons with and without diabetes, but the frequency of aa genotype of apai polymorphism was marginally higher in persons with type 2 diabetes (p =.058). fasting plasma glucose (p <.05) and prevalence of glucose intolerance (p <.05) were significantly higher in nondiabetic persons with aa genotype compared with those with aa genotype. the bb genotype of bsmi polymorphism was associated with insulin resistance as assessed by homa after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index (bmi), and calcium and vitamin d use in persons without diabetes (p <.05). our research suggests that apai polymorphism may be associated with glucose intolerance independent of defective insulin secretion and bsmi polymorphism with insulin resistance in a nondiabetic caucasian population.
the inherent difficulty of expressing clostridial at-rich genes in a heterologous host has limited their biotechnological application. we previously reported a plasmid for high-level expression of clostridial genes in clostridium perfringens (takamizawa et al., protein expr purif 36:70–75, 2004). in this study, we examined the extracellular proteases of c. perfringens strain 13. zymographic analysis and caseinase assaying of a culture supernatant showed that it contained a protease activated by dithiothreitol and ca2+, suggesting that clostripain-like protease (clp) is the most likely candidate for the major extracellular protease. disruption of the clp gene by homologous recombination markedly decreased the level of caseinase activity in the culture supernatant. analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) revealed that the clp− mutant but not the wild type strain increased the levels of many polypeptides in the culture supernatant after the late exponential growth phase. such polypeptides included both cytoplasmic and secretory proteins, suggesting proteins secreted or released into the medium were degraded by clp. to assess the effects of clp on the productivity and stability of recombinant proteins, 74-kda nani sialidase was expressed in the two strains. the mutant strain produced a higher level of nani activity than the wild type strain. furthermore, under the conditions where clp was activated, nani was degraded easily in the latter culture but not in the former one. these results indicate that the clp− mutant could serve as a useful strain for efficiently expressing and preparing protease-free clostridial proteins. aims:  to explore the potential to enhance secretion of heterologous proteins in bacillus subtilis by engineering cell factors affecting extracytoplasmic protein folding and degradation.
group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gas) is an uncommon but potentially fatal source of postpartum infection. pathogenesis in invasive gas infections has been linked to bacterial virulence factors. in this study, we sought to provide an initial description of potential virulence factors in association with puerperal morbidity by virtue of specific m-protein type antigens. women with confirmed gas puerperal infection in the salt lake city region were prospectively identified over a 6-year interval (1991-1997). from this cohort, gas isolates were analyzed with respect to m-serotype and presence of genes encoding the streptococcal pyogenic exotoxins a and b (spe-a and spe-b). bacterial isolates from 18 subjects with gas puerperal infection underwent m-serotyping and pcr-based genotyping for the spea and speb genes. among these, 8/18 subjects manifest criteria of severe disease. all 18 isolate strains expressed speb; 6/18 isolates expressed spea. of the m-serotypes, 8/8 severe disease isolates expressed m-types 1 (n=3) or 28 (n=5). pulse-field gel electrophoresis did not indicate an outbreak strain among similar isolates. we conclude that in this initial characterization, morbidity among women with gas puerperal infection is associated with m-types 1 and 28, but not speb genotype. analysis of 132 group a streptococcal (gas) isolates from 151 invasive episodes, including streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (stss), from 1983 to 1995 showed great genetic variation by use of t serotyping in combination with restriction fragment length polymorphism. in contrast, genetically homogenous t1m1 isolates appeared in epidemic patterns with significantly increased risk of stss. the spea gene, with the allelic variants spea2 and spea3 carried by the t1m1 and t3m3 serotypes, respectively, was strongly associated with stss. infection with a gas isolate carrying spea, alcohol abuse, and malignancy recently treated with cytostatic drugs were factors independently related to stss. neutralization of spea lymphocyte mitogenicity was totally absent in sera from patients with stss and low in sera from persons with uncomplicated bacteremia compared with levels in sera from uncomplicated erysipelas. neutralization of speb was significantly lower in sera of patients with stss than in sera from persons with bacteremia or erysipelas.
backgroundpatients with glioblastoma treated with bcnu wafer implantation for recurrence frequently receive frontline chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide as part of the stupp protocol. a retrospective investigation was conducted of surgical complications in a cohort of these patients treated at a single institution.methodswe searched our institutional database for patients treated between january 2006 and october 2012 who had recurrent glioblastoma previously treated with open surgery followed by the stupp protocol and then underwent repeat resection with or without bcnu wafers for recurrent disease. rates of select post-operative complications within 3 months of surgery were estimated.resultswe identified 95 patients with glioblastoma who underwent resection followed by the stupp protocol as frontline treatment. at disease recurrence (first and second recurrence), 63 patients underwent repeat resection with bcnu wafer implantation and 32 without implantation. generally, bcnu wafer use was associated with minor to moderate increases in rates of select complications versus non-implantation—wound healing abnormalities (14.2 vs. 6.2 %), cerebrospinal fluid leak (7.9 vs. 3.1 %), hydrocephalus requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunt (6.3 vs. 9.3 %), chemical meningitis (3.1 vs. 0 %), cerebral infections (3.1 vs. 0 %), cyst formation (3.1 vs. 3.1 %), cerebral edema (4.7 vs. 0 %), and empyema formations (1.5 vs. 0 %). performance status was well maintained post-operatively in both groups. median progression-free survival from the time of first recurrence was 6.0 and 5.0 months, respectively.conclusionsthe use of the stupp protocol as frontline therapy in patients with glioblastoma does not preclude the use of bcnu wafers at the time of progression. summaryfollowing the resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas, local implantation of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (gliadel®) in the resection cavity constitutes an adjuvant therapy that can improve the possibilities of survival. however, some precautions should be taken regarding gliadel implantation. we report three cases in whom patients with glioblastoma multiforme were implanted with fibrin glue-secured gliadel after the lateral ventricles had been opened, and who later developed severe hydrocephalus leading to death. although gliadel may be an important adjunct to treatment, opening of the ventricles during surgery as part of its application should be considered a contra-indication.
background: autism spectrum disorders (asds) can be conceptualized as disorders of learning, however there have been few experimental studies taking this perspective. methods: we examined the probabilistic reinforcement learning performance of 28 adults with asds and 30 typically developing adults on a task requiring learning relationships between three stimulus pairs consisting of japanese characters with feedback that was valid with different probabilities (80%, 70%, and 60%). both univariate and bayesian state–space data analytic methods were employed. hypotheses were based on the extant literature as well as on neurobiological and computational models of reinforcement learning. results: both groups learned the task after training. however, there were group differences in early learning in the first task block where individuals with asds acquired the most frequently accurately reinforced stimulus pair (80%) comparably to typically developing individuals; exhibited poorer acquisition of the less frequently reinforced 70% pair as assessed by state–space learning curves; and outperformed typically developing individuals on the near chance (60%) pair. individuals with asds also demonstrated deficits in using positive feedback to exploit rewarded choices. conclusions: results support the contention that individuals with asds are slower learners. based on neurobiology and on the results of computational modeling, one interpretation of this pattern of findings is that impairments are related to deficits in flexible updating of reinforcement history as mediated by the orbito‐frontal cortex, with spared functioning of the basal ganglia. this hypothesis about the pathophysiology of learning in asds can be tested using functional magnetic resonance imaging.autism res 2011, 4: 109–120. © 2011, international society for autism research, wiley periodicals, inc. we used event-related fmri to identify the brain regions engaged during explicit and implicit sequence learning (esl and isl, respectively). twenty-four subjects performed a concurrent esl and isl task. behavior showed learning in both conditions. prefrontal (pfc), striatal, anterior cingulate cortex (acc) and visual regions (v1, v2 and v3) were engaged during both esl and isl. with esl there was increased activity in the visual regions on the predictable (i.e. learned pattern) trials. with isl, however, there was a relative decrease in activity in visual regions. the opposite patterns in the visual regions highlight the different effects of esl and isl. the learning process was distinguished from the result of learning, by fitting subjects' functional magnetic resonance imaging data to their learning curve. this analysis revealed more extensive pfc activity during esl and caudal acc activity specific for the result of learning analysis, when the expected response was violated. our results suggest a relative dissociation of the brain regions engaged during esl and isl, whereby esl and isl can be viewed as partially distinct but overlapping parallel processes.
objective aortic regurgitation (ar) in the tetralogy of fallot (tof) is not frequent, but when present it impacts significantly on surgical management. furthermore, the incidence of late ar development has been increasing, along with surgical interest in current practices.   methods pre- and post-operative studies on 427 patients (tof, 374; tof/pa (tof with pulmonary atresia), 53) who survived corrective operation were reviewed. ar (> or =mild) was detected in 28.   results nine had ar preoperatively, while 25 (including six with preoperative ar) exhibited ar post-operatively. in the 19 who developed ar post-operatively, the aortic root diameter (aorod) and indexed aorod (%aorod) were 42+/-11 mm and 166+/-36%, increased from the preoperative values of 30+/-10mm and 149+/-24%. ar-free rate at 20 years was 95.1% of all cases studied, 84.3 vs 96.5% in tof/pa vs classic tof (p<0.0001), and 82.2 vs 97.0% in bulboventricular vsd vs infracristal vsd (p<0.0001). older age at repair, and bulboventricular vsd were identified as risk factors for the progression of ar. aortic valvuloplasty (avp; n=5) or replacement (avr; n=4) was performed nine times in eight patients before (n=1), during (n=4), or late after tof repair (n=4); all showed improvement of nyha class. survival- and reoperation-free survival curves showed no significant difference between patients with or without ar.   conclusions after repair of tof, careful observation for a late progression of ar is needed for the optimal timing of surgical intervention, especially in patients who repaired at higher age with a dilated aortic root or in patients with bulboventricular vsd. five patients with tetralogy of fallot associated with aortic insufficiency were studied. they ranged from 6 to 34 years old (mean, 14 years), and 2 patients had a history of subacute bacterial endocarditis. four patients had a bulboventricular type of ventricular septal defect. prolapse of the right coronary cusp was the main cause of aortic insufficiency. deformed valve secondary to subacute bacterial endocarditis and severe dilatation of the aortic annulus were the other causes. in addition to repair of the tetralogy defect, aortic valvuloplasty was performed in 2 patients. in the remaining 3 patients, the ventricular septal defect was closed with a relatively small-sized patch and no aortotomy was made. four patients survived the operation, and no residual aortic insufficiency was observed in 3 of them. the etiology and the method of operation are discussed.
previous studies have indicated phenotypical differences in glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 autoantibodies (gada) found in type 1 diabetes (t1d) patients, individuals at risk of developing t1d and stiff‐person syndrome (sps) patients. in a phase ii trial using aluminium‐formulated gad65 (gad‐alum) as an immunomodulator in t1d, several patients responded with high gada titres after treatment, raising concerns as to whether gad‐alum could induce gada with sps‐associated phenotypes. this study aimed to analyse gada levels, immunoglobulin (ig)g1–4 subclass frequencies, b78‐ and b96·11‐defined epitope distribution and gad65 enzyme activity in sera from four cohorts with very high gada titres: t1d patients (n = 7), gad‐alum‐treated t1d patients (n = 9), t1d high‐risk individuals (n = 6) and sps patients (n = 12). sps patients showed significantly higher gada levels and inhibited the in‐vitro gad65 enzyme activity more strongly compared to the other groups. a higher binding frequency to the b78‐defined epitope was found in the sps group compared to t1d and gad‐alum individuals, whereas no differences were detected for the b96·11‐defined epitope. gada igg1–4 subclass levels did not differ between the groups, but sps patients had higher igg2 and lower igg4 distribution more frequently. in conclusion, the in‐vitro gada phenotypes from sps patients differed from the t1d‐ and high‐risk groups, and gad‐alum treatment did not induce sps‐associated phenotypes. however, occasional overlap between the groups exists, and caution is indicated when drawing conclusions to health or disease status. background stiff-person syndrome (sps) is an immune-mediated central nervous system disorder characterized by fluctuating muscle stiffness, disabling spasms, and heightened sensitivity to external stimuli. up to 80% of patients with sps have anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad) antibodies in the serum or cerebral spinal fluid (csf). whether these antibodies are clinically relevant and correlate with disease severity is unknown.   objective to correlate anti-gad antibody titers in the serum and csf of patients with sps with the degree of clinical severity.   design patients studied the last 6 years.   setting the clinical center of the national institutes of health, bethesda, md.   patients sixteen patients with typical sps and elevated serum anti-gad antibody titers.   interventions antibody titers in serum and csf were measured by radioimmunoassay, and the intrathecal anti-gad-specific igg production was calculated.   main outcome measures comparison of antibody titers with stiffness index and heightened sensitivity scores based on scales that reliably measure disease severity.   results the mean disease duration was 11 years (range, 5-30 years). the mean anti-gad antibody titer in the serum was 51 500 u/ml (range, 24 000-200 000 u/ml); and in the csf, 181 u/ml (range, 30-400 u/ml). a 10-fold increased intrathecal production of gad-specific igg antibodies was noted. no correlation was found between antibody titers in serum or csf with disease severity. in 4 patients, the anti-gad antibody titers measured serially during a 2-year period did not correlate with clinical fluctuations.   conclusions in patients with sps, the anti-gad antibody titers in serum and csf do not correlate with disease severity or duration. anti-gad antibodies are an excellent marker for sps, but monitoring their titers during the course of the disease may not be of practical value.
abstract origin and tectonic setting of the late neoproterozoic dokhan volcanics (ca. 610–560 ma by whole rock rb–sr and ca. 600–590 ma by shrimp u–pb zircon) in the egyptian eastern desert is debated. debate concerns the tectonic setting they formed in, during transition between convergent to extensional, during or after collision of e and w gondwana ∼600 ma. in order to solve this problem, we studied the geology and analyzed major and trace elements of lavas from wadi um sidra and um asmer in the northern eastern desert. these range from medium- to high-k basalt to rhyolite. they comprise voluminous medium- to high-k calc-alkaline lavas, subordinate adakitic lavas, and minor alkali basalt. adakitic lavas contain very low y ( 767 ppm) and sr/y (>40). they also have high cr and ni and low nb, rb, and zr contents compared to coexisting calc-alkaline lavas. the adakitic lavas exhibit a fractionated rare earth element (ree) patterns with hree depletion (la n /lu n  = 11.1–14.4), while calc-alkaline rocks have less fractionated ree patterns (la n /lu n  = 6.3–9.4). ree patterns of the alkali basalt are also similar to that of adakitic lavas. these alkali basalt, calc-alkaline, and adakitic lavas all show enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (liles) and show negative nb–ta anomalies with high th/zr, which suggest involvement of subducted slab melts in their petrogenesis. our proposal is subduction of hot oceanic ridge before collision and later melting of the hot oceanic slab beneath dokhan even after collision event. willis, k.m., stern, r.j. and clauer, n., 1988. age and geochemistry of late precambrian sediments of the hammamat series from the northeastern desert of egypt. precambrian res., 42: 173-187. late precambrian crustal evolution in the northeastern desert of egypt culminated in a major episode of strong extension, accompanied by bimodal igneous activity and deposition of clastic sediments in restricted terrigenous basins. these sediments, known as the hammamat series, record the uncovering of the evolving crust of the region. we have undertaken petrographic, geochemical, and rb-sr and k-ar geochronologic studies of hammamat samples collected along a single traverse. the lower half of a 400 m thick section consists of coarse detritus shed from nearby ensimatic terranes, while the upper half was derived from rapid reworking of bimodal igneous rocks similar to those of the dokhan volcanics and pink granites, units that are preserved within the region. rb-sr whole-rock analyses give an 8-point isochron age of 585 +_ 15 ma with an initial stsr/~sr of 0.70323 ± 0.00013, interpreted to approximate closely the time of sedimentation. this is very similar to the k-ar ages of the coarser clay fractions (2-0.5 #m) (588-567 ma). this result is consistent with stratigraphic considerations and other geochronological studies indicating that hammamat deposition occurred at ~ 590 ma. rb-sr analyses of leached and unleached size fractions indicate thermal resetting at 524 +_ 17 ma accompanied or followed by fluxing of a radiogenic sr-rich pore fluid (stsr/s~sr =0.7124). this is further indicated by k-ar ages of the 0.2-0.5 ttm size fraction of 542-532 ma.
backgroundephb receptors and their ephrin-b ligands play an important role in nervous system development, as well as synapse formation and plasticity in the adult brain. recent studies show that intrathecal treatment with ephb-receptor activator ephrinb2-fc induced thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in rat, indicating that ephrin-b2 in small dorsal root ganglia (drg) neurons and ephb receptors in the spinal cord modulate pain processing. to examine the role of ephrin-b2 in peripheral pain pathways, we deleted ephrin-b2 in nav1.8+ nociceptive sensory neurons with the cre-loxp system. sensory neuron numbers and terminals were examined using neuronal makers. pain behavior in acute, inflammatory and neuropathic pain models was assessed in the ephrin-b2 conditional knockout (cko) mice. we also investigated the c-fos expression and nmda receptor nr2b phosphorylation in ephrin-b2 cko mice and littermate controls.resultsthe ephrin-b2 cko mice were healthy with no sensory neuron loss. however, pain-related behavior was substantially altered. although acute pain behavior and motor co-ordination were normal, inflammatory pain was attenuated in ephrin-b2 mutant mice. complete freund's adjuvant (cfa)-induced mechanical hyperalgesia was halved. formalin-induced pain behavior was attenuated in the second phase, and this correlated with diminished tyrosine phosphorylation of n-methyl-d-aspartic acid (nmda) receptor subunit nr2b in the dorsal horn. thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were significantly reduced in the seltzer model of neuropathic pain.conclusionspresynaptic ephrin-b2 expression thus plays an important role in regulating inflammatory pain through the regulation of synaptic plasticity in the dorsal horn and is also involved in the pathogenesis of some types of neuropathic pain. the maintenance of bone homeostasis is tightly controlled, and largely dependent upon cellular communication between osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and the coupling of bone resorption to bone formation. this tight coupling is essential for the correct function and maintenance of the skeletal system, repairing microscopic skeletal damage and replacing aged bone. a range of pathologic diseases, including osteoporosis and cancer-induced bone disease, disrupt this coupling and cause subsequent alterations in bone homeostasis. eph receptors and their associated ligands, ephrins, play critical roles in a number of cellular processes including immune regulation, neuronal development and cancer metastasis. eph receptors are also expressed by cells found within the bone marrow microenvironment, including osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and there is increasing evidence to implicate this family of receptors in the control of normal and pathological bone remodeling.
to determine whether the intrinsic laryngeal muscles exhibit a response to induced autonomic nervous system (ans) activation, and to characterize responses that may occur. background in companion studies on canine and rodent laryngeal muscle, we observed that (1) muscle fibers in both the canine and rodent posterior cricoarytenoid (pca) muscles have a slower myosin heavy-chain (myhc) isoform profile than those in the thyroarytenoid (ta) muscle; (2) the muscle fiber composition of pca and ta muscles in canines and rodents is complex given the presence of so-called hybrid fibers (fibers coexpressing various combinations of myhc isoforms); (3) the types and proportions of hybrid fibers are both muscle specific and, in some cases, region specific; and (4) the myhc isoform profile of canine laryngeal muscle appears to be slower than that of rodent laryngeal muscle, suggesting the possibility that larger mammals have a slower myhc isoform profile.   objectives given the findings of these companion studies and the fact that very little is known about the myhc isoform composition of laryngeal muscle fibers, the primary objectives of this study were to determine (1) the types of myhc isoforms found in the human pca and ta muscles, (2) if there were regional differences in myhc isoform composition, (3) if hybrid fibers commonly occur in human laryngeal muscle, and (4) if the myhc isoform profile of human laryngeal muscle is slower than that of canine and rodent laryngeal muscle.   results and conclusions the findings of this study clearly demonstrate that both the pca and ta muscles in humans express 3 types of myhc isoforms (ie, slow type i, fast type iia, and fast type iix myhc isoforms). at the single-fiber level, there were distinct regional differences and hybrid fibers were a common occurrence. finally, the data demonstrate that the pca and ta muscles of humans have a slower myhc profile than that found in either canine or rodent laryngeal muscle.
as impaired insulin signalling (iis) is a risk factor for alzheimer’s disease we crossed mice (tg2576) over-expressing human amyloid precursor protein (app), with insulin receptor substrate 2 null (irs2−/−) mice which develop insulin resistance. the resulting tg2576/irs2−/− animals had increased tau phosphorylation but a paradoxical amelioration of aβ pathology. an increase of the aβ binding protein transthyretin suggests that increased clearance of aβ underlies the reduction in plaques. increased tau phosphorylation correlated with reduced tau-phosphatase pp2a, despite an inhibition of the tau-kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3. our findings demonstrate that disruption of iis in tg2576 mice has divergent effects on pathological processes—a reduction in aggregated aβ but an increase in tau phosphorylation. however, as these effects are accompanied by improvement in behavioural deficits, our findings suggest a novel protective effect of disrupting irs2 signalling in ad which may be a useful therapeutic strategy for this condition. alzheimer's disease (ad) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid β-peptide (a-beta) in the brain. transthyretin (ttr) is a tetrameric protein of about 55 kda mainly produced in the liver and choroid plexus of the brain. the known physiological functions of ttr are the transport of thyroid hormone t4 and retinol, through binding to the retinol binding protein. ttr has also been established as a cryptic protease able to cleave apoa-i in vitro. it has been described that ttr is involved in preventing a-beta fibrilization, both by inhibiting and disrupting a-beta fibrils, with consequent abrogation of toxicity. we further characterized the nature of the ttr/a-beta interaction and found that ttr, both recombinant or isolated from human sera, was able to proteolytically process a-beta, cleaving the peptide after aminoacid residues 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 14,16, 19 and 27, as determined by mass spectrometry, and reversed phase chromatography followed by n-terminal sequencing. a-beta peptides (1–14) and (15–42) showed lower amyloidogenic potential than the full length counterpart, as assessed by thioflavin binding assay and ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy. a-beta cleavage by ttr was inhibited in the presence of an αapp peptide containing the kunitz protease inhibitor (kpi) domain but not in the presence of the secreted αapp derived from the app isoform 695 without the kpi domain. ttr was also able to degrade aggregated forms of a-beta peptide. our results confirmed ttr as a protective molecule in ad, and prompted a-beta proteolysis by ttr as a protective mechanism in this disease. ttr may prove to be a useful therapeutic agent for preventing or retarding the cerebral amyloid plaque formation implicated in ad pathology.
introductionthe ets-1 transcription factor is a candidate breast cancer oncogene that regulates the expression of genes involved in tumor progression and metastasis. ets-1 signaling has also been linked to the development of a basal-like breast cancer phenotype. we recently described a nitric oxide (no)-induced gene signature that is associated with poor disease outcome in estrogen receptor-negative (er-) breast cancer and contains both stem cell-like and basal-like components. thus, we examined the role of ets-1 in no signaling and no-induced phenotypes in er- human breast cancer cells.methodspromoter region analyses were performed on genes upregulated in inducible nitric oxide synthase (nos2) high expressing tumors for ets-binding sites. in vitro mechanisms were examined in human basal-like breast cancer cells lines. no signaling effects were studied using either forced nos2 expression or the use of a chemical no-donor, diethlylenetriamine nonoate (detano).resultspromoter region analysis of genes that are up-regulated in human er-negative breast tumors with high nos2 expression revealed that the ets-binding sequence is the only common promoter element present in all of these genes, indicating that ets-1 is the key transcriptional factor down-stream of oncogenic nos2-signaling. accordingly, both forced nos2 over-expression and exposure to no-donors resulted in significant ets-1 transcriptional activation in er- breast cancer cells. functional studies showed that no activated ets-1 transcriptional activity via a ras/mek/erk signaling pathway by a mechanism that involved ras s-nitrosylation. rna knock-down of ets-1 suppressed no-induced expression of selected basal-like breast cancer markers such as p-cadherin, s100a8, il-8 and αβ-crystallin. additionally, ets-1 knock-down reduced no-mediated cellular proliferation, matrix metalloproteinase and cathepsin b activities, as well as matrigel invasion.conclusionsthese data show that ets-1 is a key transcriptional mediator of oncogenic no signaling that promotes the development of an aggressive disease phenotype in er- breast cancer in an ets-1 and ras-dependent manner, providing novel clues of how nos2 expression in human breast tumors is functionally linked to poor patient survival. no produced in tumors can either positively or negatively regulate growth. to examine this dichotomy, effects of no concentration and duration on the posttranslational regulation of several key proteins were examined in human breast mcf7 cells under aerobic conditions. we found that different concentration thresholds of no appear to elicit a discrete set of signal transduction pathways. at low steady-state concentrations of no (<50 nm), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) phosphorylation was induced via a guanylate cyclase-dependent mechanism. hypoxic inducible factor 1α (hif-1α) accumulation was associated with an intermediate amount of no (>100 nm), whereas p53 serine 15 phosphorylation occurred at considerably higher levels (>300 nm). erk phosphorylation was transient during no exposure. hif-1α stabilization paralleled the presence of no, whereas p53 serine 15 phosphorylation was detected during, and persisted after, no exposure. the dose-dependent effects of synthetic no donors were mimicked by activated macrophages cocultured with mcf7 cells at varying ratios. erk and hif-1α activation was similar in breast cancer cell lines either mutant (mb231) or null (mb157) in p53. the stabilization of hif-1α by no was not observed with increased mcf7 cell density, demonstrating the interrelationship between no and o2 consumption. the findings show that concentration and duration of no exposure are critical determinants in the regulation of tumor-related proteins.
statistical science) bayesian spatial quantile regression by kristian lum department of statistical science duke university with scientific data available at geocoded locations, investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models for carrying out statistical inference. over the last decade, hierarchical models implemented through markov chain monte carlo methods have become especially popular for spatial modelling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible with classical methods as well as their avoidance of possibly inappropriate asymptotics. however, fitting hierarchical spatial models often involves expensive matrix decompositions whose computational complexity increases in cubic order with the number of spatial locations, rendering such models infeasible for large spatial data sets. this computational burden is exacerbated in multivariate settings with several spatially dependent response variables. it is also aggravated when data are collected at frequent time points and spatiotemporal process models are used. with regard to this challenge, our contribution is to work with what we call predictive process models for spatial and spatiotemporal data. every spatial (or spatiotemporal) process induces a predictive process model (in fact, arbitrarily many of them). the latter models project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the computational burden. hence, we achieve the flexibility to accommodate non-stationary, non-gaussian, possibly multivariate, possibly spatiotemporal processes in the context of large data sets. we discuss attractive theoretical properties of these predictive processes. we also provide a computational template encompassing these diverse settings. finally, we illustrate the approach with simulated and real data sets.
genome-wide association studies have implicated the chrna5-chrna3-chrnb4 gene cluster in risk for heavy smoking and several smoking-related disorders. the heavy smoking risk allele might reduce the aversive effects of nicotine, but this hypothesis has not been tested in humans. we evaluated the effects of a candidate causal variant in chrna5, rs16969968, on the acute response to nicotine in european american (ea) and african american (aa) smokers (n=192; 50% aa; 73% male). following overnight abstinence from nicotine, participants completed a protocol that included an intravenous (iv) dose of saline and two escalating iv doses of nicotine. the outcomes evaluated were the aversive, pleasurable, and stimulatory ratings of nicotine’s effects, cardiovascular reactivity to nicotine, withdrawal severity, and cognitive performance before and after the nicotine administration session. the heavy smoking risk allele (rs16969968*a; frequency=28% (ea) and 6% (aa)) was associated with lower ratings of aversive effects (p<5 × 10−8) with marked specificity. this effect was evident in ea and aa subjects analyzed as separate groups and was most robust at the highest nicotine dose. rs16969968*a was also associated with greater improvement on a measure of cognitive control (stroop task) following nicotine administration. these findings support differential aversive response to nicotine as one likely mechanism for the association of chrna5-chrna3-chrnb4 with heavy smoking. objectiveallelic variation in the α5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nachr) subunit gene, chrna5, increases vulnerability to tobacco addiction. here, we investigated the role of α5* nachrs in the effects of nicotine on brain reward systems.materials and methodseffects of acute (0.03125–0.5 mg/kg sc) or chronic (24 mg/kg per day; osmotic minipump) nicotine and mecamylamine-precipitated withdrawal on intracranial self-stimulation (icss) thresholds were assessed in wild-type and α5 nachr subunit knockout mice. noxious effects of nicotine were further investigated using a conditioned taste aversion procedure.resultslower nicotine doses (0.03125–0.125 mg/kg) decreased icss thresholds in wild-type and α5 knockout mice. at higher doses (0.25–0.5 mg/kg), threshold-lowering effects of nicotine were diminished in wild-type mice, whereas nicotine lowered thresholds across all doses tested in α5 knockout mice. nicotine (1.5 mg/kg) conditioned a taste aversion to saccharine equally in both genotypes. mecamylamine (5 mg/kg) elevated icss thresholds by a similar magnitude in wild-type and α5 knockout mice prepared with minipumps delivering nicotine. unexpectedly, mecamylamine also elevated thresholds in saline-treated α5 knockout mice.conclusionα5* nachrs are not involved in reward-enhancing effects of lower nicotine doses, the reward-inhibiting effects of nicotine withdrawal, or the general noxious effects of higher nicotine doses. instead, α5* nachrs regulate the reward-inhibiting effects nicotine doses that oppose the reward-facilitating effects of the drug. these data suggest that disruption of α5* nachr signaling greatly expands the range of nicotine doses that facilitate brain reward activity, which may help explain the increased tobacco addiction vulnerability associated with chrna5 risk alleles.
a simple technique for high-throughput protein crystallization in ionically cross-linked polysaccharide gel beads has been developed for contactless handling of crystals in x-ray crystallography. the method is designed to reduce mechanical damage to crystals caused by physical contact between crystal and mount tool and by osmotic shock during various manipulations including cryoprotection, heavy-atom derivatization, ligand soaking, and diffraction experiments. for this study, protein crystallization in alginate and κ-carrageenan gel beads was performed using six test proteins, demonstrating that proteins could be successfully crystallized in gel beads. two complete diffraction data sets from lysozyme and id70067 protein crystals in gel beads were collected at 100 k without removing the crystals; the results showed that the crystals had low mosaicities. in addition, crystallization of glucose isomerase was carried out in alginate gel beads in the presence of synthetic zeolite molecular sieves (ms), a hetero-epitaxic nucleant; the results demonstrated that ms can reduce excess nucleation of this protein in beads. to demonstrate heavy-atom derivatization, lysozyme crystals were successfully derivatized with k2ptbr6 within alginate gel beads. these results suggest that gel beads prevent serious damage to protein crystals during such experiments. the introduction of electrostatic layer-by-layer (lbl) self-assembly has shown broad biomedical applications in thin film coating, micropatterning, nanobioreactors, artificial cells, and drug delivery systems. multiple assembly polyelectrolytes and proteins are based on electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged layers. the film architecture is precisely designed and can be controlled to 1-nm precision with a range from 5 to 1000 nm. thin films can be deposited on any surface including many widely used biomaterials. microencapsulation of micro/nanotemplates with multilayers enabled cell surface modification, controlled drug release, hollow shell formation, and nanobioreactors. both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate potential applications in biology, pharmaceutics, medicine, and other biomedical areas.
at the early stage of alzheimer's disease (ad), the accumulation of β‐amyloid (aβ) oligomers disturbs intracellular ca2+ homeostasis and disrupts synaptic plasticity of brain neurons. prevention of aβ‐induced synaptic failure remains an unsolved problem for the treatment of ad. here, the effects of 2‐aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2‐apb), a non‐specific, but moderately potent ca2+ channel inhibitor, on aβ‐induced deficit of synaptic long‐term potentiation (ltp) and the underlying molecular mechanisms were explored. beta amyloid (abeta), a peptide generated from the amyloid precursor protein (app) by neurons, is widely believed to underlie the pathophysiology of alzheimer's disease. recent studies indicate that this peptide can drive loss of surface ampa and nmda type glutamate receptors. we now show that abeta employs signaling pathways of long-term depression (ltd) to drive endocytosis of synaptic ampa receptors. synaptic removal of ampa receptors is necessary and sufficient to produce loss of dendritic spines and synaptic nmda responses. our studies indicate the central role played by ampa receptor trafficking in abeta-induced modification of synaptic structure and function.
introduction: retreatment of endodontically treated teeth is a challenge that requires complete removal of the previous filling material. several techniques are indicated for this procedure. the present review tries to identify the most efficient method for extirpation of resilon (rs) root fillings and to compare the speed and efficacy of rs and gutta-percha (gp) root filling removal. methods and materials: three trained evaluators conducted a search through three major databases (pubmed, cochrane library and lilacs) over the articles published in the period from 2001 to 2014. the search keywords were epiphany sealer, resilon, retreatment and removal procedure. results: twelve articles were included in the final sample (three in vitro studies and nine randomized trials). conclusion: the protaper (manual or rotatory) system in combination with chemical solvents is the most efficient method for removing resilon root filling. retreatment of resilon is more rapid and associated with less remnants of debris. objective retreatment of a root canal in the case of infection requires complete removal of previous filling material. this study evaluated the efficacy of 3 techniques in removing laterally compacted resilon/epiphany and gutta-percha/ah plus from straight and curved canals during retreatment.   materials and methods extracted human teeth (90 maxillary anterior teeth with single,straight root canals and 90 mandibular molars with mesial canal root curvatures of 20 degrees to 35 degrees ) were divided into 6 groups each consisting of 15 straight and 15 curved root canals. three groups were obturated using gutta-percha/ah plus and 3 were obturated with resilon/epiphany. after 3 weeks storage at 37 degrees c and 100% humidity, all root canal fillings were removed using a gates glidden drill, a gates glidden drill plus chloroform or a system b device.   results for all removal techniques, specimens obturated with gutta-percha/ah plus showed significantly more remnants of obturation material than specimens filled with resilon/epiphany for both straight and curved canals (p < 0.05). removal time was shorter for resilon/epiphany than gutta-percha/ah plus filling for all techniques and for both curved and straight canals. the gates glidden drill and gates glidden drill plus chloroform removal techniques were significantly faster than the system b technique for both straight and curved canals. the gates glidden drill technique was best for straight canals, whereas the gates glidden drill plus chloroform was the best technique for curved canals when removing resilon/epiphany sealer.   conclusions removal of resilon/epiphany filling resulted in fewer remnants and was faster than gutta-percha/ah plus removal using a gates glidden drill with or without chloroform in both straight and curved canals.
objective to study the relationship and changes of cervical mri, tcd and baep in patients with "isolated" vertigo.   methods the relationship and changes of cervical mri, tcd and baep were investigated respectively in 125 patients with "isolated" vertigo and 100 healthy controls.   results there were statistically significant differences between two groups for overall abnormalities of tcd (x(2) = 61.96, p<0.01), baep (x(2) = 97.99, p<0.01), and cervical mri severity scale (z = -8.71, p<0.01). in vertigo group, results showed significant correlations between tcd and cervical mri, tcd and baep as well. and analysis on tcd pi and some items of baep demonstrated positive linear correlations. there were no statistical differences or correlations in control group.   conclusions tcd is a sensitive method of "isolated" vertigo screening. a combined test protocol of cervical mri, tcd and baep has superiorities to assess "isolated" vertigo. abstract objectives: vertigo can be a manifestation of underlying vertebrobasilar stroke in older adults. the study objectives were to investigate the correlation, sensitivity, and specificity of the auditory brainstem response (abr), electronystagmorgraphy (eng), and transcranial doppler (tcd) collectively to distinguish between vertigo due to vertebrobasilar insufficiency (vbi) and vertigo due to non-vbi. design: prospective experimental study comparing eng, abr, and tcd battery findings between two groups of patients with vertigo and a control group. study sample: participants included 14 patients with vertigo of vbi origin, 14 patients with vertigo of non-vbi, and 11 matched controls. results: participants with vbi had more abnormal findings in the eng (86%), tcd (72%), and abr (64%) compared to the non-vbi group (64%, 21%, and 7%, respectively) and the control group. the combined battery revealed positive correlations, 64% sensitivity, and 84% positive predictive value (ppv) in the vbi group, and 100% specificity with lack of correlations in the non-vbi group. conclusions: the modest sensitivity and ppv helps with early detection of vbi, thus preventing risk of vertebrobasilar stroke in 84% to 64% of patients. the 100% specificity in the non-vbi group rules out vbi, thus reducing the referral rate for unnecessary, diagnostic evaluations and ineffective treatment.
ionizing radiation induces autophosphorylation of the ataxia‐telangiectasia mutated (atm) protein kinase on serine 1981; however, the precise mechanisms that regulate atm activation are not fully understood. here, we show that the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (oa) induces autophosphorylation of atm on serine 1981 in unirradiated cells at concentrations that inhibit protein phosphatase 2a‐like activity in vitro. oa did not induce γ‐h2ax foci, suggesting that it induces atm autophosphorylation by inactivation of a protein phosphatase rather than by inducing dna double‐strand breaks. in support of this, we show that atm interacts with the scaffolding (a) subunit of protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a), that the scaffolding and catalytic (c) subunits of pp2a interact with atm in undamaged cells and that immunoprecipitates of atm from undamaged cells contain pp2a‐like protein phosphatase activity. moreover, we show that ir induces phosphorylation‐dependent dissociation of pp2a from atm and loss of the associated protein phosphatase activity. we propose that pp2a plays an important role in the regulation of atm autophosphorylation and activity in vivo. dna-dependent protein kinase (dna-pk) is a complex of dna-pk catalytic subunit (dna-pkcs) and the dna end-binding ku70/ku80 heterodimer. dna-pk is required for dna double strand break repair by the process of nonhomologous end joining. nonhomologous end joining is a major mechanism for the repair of dna double strand breaks in mammalian cells. as such, dna-pk plays essential roles in the cellular response to ionizing radiation and in v(d)j recombination. in vitro, dna-pk undergoes phosphorylation of all three protein subunits (dna-pk catalytic subunit, ku70 and ku80) and phosphorylation correlates with inactivation of the serine/threonine protein kinase activity of dna-pk. here we show that phosphorylation-induced loss of the protein kinase activity of dna-pk is restored by the addition of the purified catalytic subunit of either protein phosphatase 1 or protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) and that this reactivation is blocked by the potent protein phosphatase inhibitor, microcystin. we also show that treating human lymphoblastoid cells with either okadaic acid or fostriecin, at pp2a-selective concentrations, causes a 50–60% decrease in dna-pk protein kinase activity, although the protein phosphatase 1 activity in these cells was unaffected. in vivo phosphorylation of dna-pkcs, ku70, and ku80 was observed when cells were labeled with [32p]inorganic phosphate in the presence of the protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid. together, our data suggest that reversible protein phosphorylation is an important mechanism for the regulation of dna-pk protein kinase activity and that the protein phosphatase responsible for reactivation in vivo is a pp2a-like enzyme.
abstractbackgroundprosthetic reconstruction may be a promising treatment for peri-acetabular malignant bone tumour; however, it is associated with a high complication rate. therefore, prosthetic design and approach of prosthetic reconstruction after tumour resection warrant study.methodswe retrospectively analyzed 11 patients with peri-acetabular malignant bone tumours treated by personalized 3d-printed hemipelvic prostheses after en bloc resection between 2015 and 2016. pre-operative and post-operative pain at rest was assessed according to a 10-cm vas score. the results of functional improvement were evaluated using the msts-93 score at the final follow-up. we also analyzed tumour recurrence, metastases, and complications associated with the reconstruction procedure.resultsall patients were observed for six to 24 months with an average follow-up of 15.5 months. one patient had occasional pain of the involved hip at the final follow-up (vas, pre vs. post 8 months: 3 vs. 2). the mean msts-93 score was 19.2 (range, 13–25). hip dislocation was detected in two patients, while delayed wound healing occurred in one patient. one patient with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma had a left iliac bone metastasis. local tumour recurrence was not observed.conclusionsreconstruction of bony defect after tumour resection using personalized 3d-printed hemipelvic prostheses can obtain acceptable functional results without severe complications. based on previous reports and our results, we believe that reconstruction arthroplasty using 3d-printed hemipelvic prostheses will provide a promising alternative for those patients with peri-acetabular malignant bone tumours.  level of evidence: level iv, therapeutic study. five children with pelvic ewing's sarcoma whose age was 6-10 years underwent reconstruction after resection of the tumor. one child with a tumor of the ilium underwent an iliosacral arthrodesis with allograft. three patients underwent a hip transposition after the resection of the ilium and the upper part of the acetabulum. one patient underwent no skeletal reconstruction after the resection of the acetabulum and the ilium. two children are alive 96 and 60 months after surgery; however, two died 12 and 21 months after surgery of metastasis, and one is alive with metastasis 15 months after surgery. functional evaluation was possible in four patients: one is excellent, and three are fair. after resection of the ilium, including the upper part of the acetabulum, a hip transposition can be selected. if all the acetabulum is resected, it will be optimal not to do a bony reconstruction.
background: to elucidate the rate-determining steps of cellobiohydrolase cel7a from t. reesei, variants with lower substrate affinity were designed. results: mutant (w38a) had reduced substrate affinity but a 2-fold increase in the maximum quasi-steady-state rate. conclusion: dissociation of stalled trcel7a is the rate-limiting step in the initial phase of hydrolysis. significance: this work offers a new perspective for the design of faster cellulases. despite intensive research, the mechanism of the rapid retardation in the rates of cellobiohydrolase (cbh) catalyzed cellulose hydrolysis is still not clear. interpretation of the hydrolysis data has been complicated by the inability to measure the catalytic constants for cbh‐s acting on cellulose. we developed a method for measuring the observed catalytic constant (kobs) for cbh catalyzed cellulose hydrolysis. it relies on in situ measurement of the concentration of cbh with the active site occupied by the cellulose chain. for that we followed the specific inhibition of the hydrolysis of para‐nitrophenyl‐β‐d‐lactoside by cellulose. the method was applied to cbh‐s trcel7a from trichoderma reesei and pccel7d from phanerochaete chrysosporium and their isolated catalytic domains. bacterial microcrystalline cellulose, avicel, amorphous cellulose, and lignocellulose were used as substrates. a rapid decrease of kobs in time was observed on all substrates. the kobs values for pccel7d were about 1.5 times higher than those for trcel7a. in case of both trcel7a and pccel7d, the kobs values for catalytic domains were similar to those for intact enzymes. a model where cbh action is limited by the average length of obstacle‐free way on cellulose chain is proposed. once formed, productive cbh–cellulose complex proceeds with a constant rate determined by the true catalytic constant. after encountering an obstacle cbh will “get stuck” and the rate of further cellulose hydrolysis will be governed by the dissociation rate constant (koff), which is low for processive cbh‐s. biotechnol. bioeng. 2010;106: 871–883. © 2010 wiley periodicals, inc.
hearing disorders are common among children with autism, ranging from peripheral and sensorineural hearing deficit or loss to auditory hypersensitivity with bizarre reactions to sounds. the auditory abnormalities and consequent sensory deprivation exacerbate the communication deficit of autism, and early auditory assessment holds an important place in the planning of intervention and the overall prognosis of patients. physiologic, pathologic, imaging, and neurochemical studies have revealed an array of aberrations in the perception and processing of the audiologic stimuli, including (among others) maturational defects, atypical lateralization, and serotonin dysfunction. the structure of the planum temporale is often disturbed in disorders with associated communication problems, particularly in auditory and language processing areas in the brain. we hypothesized that people with autism would have reduced left hemisphere volumes in the planum temporale, a language related brain structure. we performed magnetic resonance imaging scans of 15 adults with autistic disorder and 15 comparison subjects, and measured the volume of gray matter in the planum temporale and heschl's gyrus (hg) in both hemispheres. planum temporale volume reduced in the left hemisphere of the autism group (p<0.003). no differences in hg volumes were observed between the two groups. the volume reduction seen in the left hemisphere of the autism group may suggest an early neurodevelopmental disturbance in autism that impacts language development.
objectives the goal of this study was to investigate the role in atherosclerosis of the tumor suppressor protein arf (human p14(arf), mouse p19(arf)) encoded by the cdkn2a gene.   background atherosclerosis is characterized by excessive proliferation and apoptosis, 2 cellular processes regulated by cdkn2a. although recent genome-wide association studies have linked atherosclerotic diseases to a genomic region in human chromosome 9p21 near the cdkn2a locus, the mechanisms underlying this gene-disease association remain undefined, and no causal link has been established between cdkn2a and atherosclerosis.   methods atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein e (apoe)-null and doubly deficient apoe-p19(arf) mice were fed an atherogenic diet and sacrificed to quantify atherosclerosis burden in whole-mounted aortas and in aortic cross-sections. proliferation and apoptosis were investigated in atherosclerotic lesions and in primary cultures of macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells obtained from both groups of mice.   results genetic disruption of p19(arf) in apoe-null mice augments aortic atherosclerosis without affecting body weight, plasma lipoproteins, or plaque's proliferative activity. notably, p19(arf) deficiency significantly attenuates apoptosis both in atherosclerotic lesions and in cultured macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells, 2 major cellular constituents of atheromatous plaques.   conclusions our findings establish a direct link between p19(arf), plaque apoptosis, and atherosclerosis, and suggest that human genetic variants associated to diminished cdkn2a expression may accelerate atherosclerosis by limiting plaque apoptosis. coronary heart disease (chd) is a major cause of death in western countries. we used genome-wide association scanning to identify a 58-kilobase interval on chromosome 9p21 that was consistently associated with chd in six independent samples (more than 23,000 participants) from four caucasian populations. this interval, which is located near the cdkn2a and cdkn2b genes, contains no annotated genes and is not associated with established chd risk factors such as plasma lipoproteins, hypertension, or diabetes. homozygotes for the risk allele make up 20 to 25% of caucasians and have a approximately 30 to 40% increased risk of chd.
formation of the mammalian secondary palate is a highly regulated and complex process. impairment of the underlying cellular and molecular programs often results in cleft palate, a common birth defect in mammals. here we report that tbx2 and tbx3, two closely related genes encoding t-box transcription factors, are expressed in the mesenchyme of the mouse palatal structures during development. mice homozygous mutant for tbx2 and mice double heterozygous for tbx2 and tbx3 exhibit a cleft palate phenotype arguing for an important contribution of tbx2 and tbx3 to palatogenesis. in tbx2-deficient embryos, the bilateral primordial palatal shelves form but are smaller and retarded in the outgrowth process. they do not make contact but retain the potential to fuse. development of other craniofacial structures appears normal, suggesting that impaired palate formation in tbx2-mutant mice is caused by a primary defect in the palatal shelf mesenchyme. this is further supported by increased cell proliferation and apoptosis accompanied by increased expression of bmp4 and cyclind1 in tbx2-deficient palatal shelves. hence, tbx2 and tbx3 function overlappingly to control growth of the palatal shelf mesenchyme. ephs and ephrins are cell surface receptors that bind to each other and initiate distinct, bidirectional signalling pathways in processes known as forward (eph) and reverse (ephrin) signalling. previous work had shown that the loss of ephrinb1 protein alone or compound loss of ephb2 and ephb3 leads to cleft palate. because of the bidirectional signalling capability of these molecules, it was not clear whether forward or reverse signalling caused the cleft palate in the ephrinb1 protein null or ephb2 and ephb3 compound null mice. we demonstrate that forward signalling is essential for palatogenesis. foetuses with a cytoplasmically truncated ephb2 protein, which could initiate reverse but not forward signalling, and were protein null for ephb3 had a cleft palate. this happened because their palatal shelves, which could elevate in vivo and adhere and fuse in culture, were too small to contact one another. small shelf size was due to reduced proliferation in the palatal mesenchyme. the reduced proliferation was not the result of abnormal vascular development within the palate. in conclusion, strong evidence is provided for specific and co-operative roles of ephb2 and ephb3 in palate development.
abstract a growing number of genomic tools and databases were developed to facilitate the interpretation of genomic variants, particularly in coding regions. however, these tools are separately available in different online websites or databases, making it challenging for general clinicians, geneticists and biologists to obtain the first-hand information regarding some particular variants and genes of interest. starting with coding regions and splice sties, we artificially generated all possible single nucleotide variants (n = 110 154 363) and cataloged all reported insertion and deletions (n = 1 223 370). we then annotated these variants with respect to functional consequences from more than 60 genomic data sources to develop a database, named varcards (http://varcards.biols.ac.cn/), by which users can conveniently search, browse and annotate the variant- and gene-level implications of given variants, including the following information: (i) functional effects; (ii) functional consequences through different in silico algorithms; (iii) allele frequencies in different populations; (iv) disease- and phenotype-related knowledge; (v) general meaningful gene-level information; and (vi) drug–gene interactions. as a case study, we successfully employed varcards in interpretation of de novo mutations in autism spectrum disorders. in conclusion, varcards provides an intuitive interface of necessary information for researchers to prioritize candidate variations and genes. dna sequencing technologies continue to make progress in increased throughput and quality, and decreased cost. as we transition from whole exome capture sequencing to whole genome sequencing (wgs), our ability to convert machine-generated variant calls, including single nucleotide variant (snv) and insertion-deletion variants (indels), into human-interpretable knowledge has lagged far behind the ability to obtain enormous amounts of variants. to help narrow this gap, here we present wgsa (wgs annotator), a functional annotation pipeline for human genome sequencing studies, which is runnable out of the box on the amazon compute cloud and is freely downloadable at (https://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/wgsa/).  functional annotation is a key step in wgs analysis. in one way, annotation helps the analyst filter to a subset of elements of particular interest (eg, cell type specific enhancers), in another way annotation helps the investigators to increase the power of identifying phenotype-associated loci (eg, association test using functional prediction score as a weight) and interpret potentially interesting findings. currently, there are several popular gene model based annotation tools, including annovar,1 snpeff2 and the ensembl variant effect predictor (vep).3 these can annotate a variety of protein coding and non-coding gene models from a range of species. it is well known among practitioners that different databases (eg, refseq4 and ensembl5) use different models for …
antibody-producing hybridoma cell lines were created following immunisation with a crude extract of cell wall polymers from the plant arabidopsis thaliana. in order to rapidly screen the specificities of individual monoclonal antibodies (mabs), their binding to microarrays containing 50 cell wall glycans immobilized on nitrocellulose was assessed. hierarchical clustering of microarray binding profiles from newly produced mabs, together with the profiles for mabs with previously defined specificities allowed the rapid assignments of mab binding to antigen classes. mab specificities were further investigated using subsequent immunochemical and biochemical analyses and two novel mabs are described in detail. mab lm13 binds to an arabinanase-sensitive pectic epitope and mab lm14, binds to an epitope occurring on arabinogalactan-proteins. both mabs display novel patterns of recognition of cell walls in plant materials. a range of synthetic methyl hexagalacturonates were used as potential hapten inhibitors in competitive-inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) with anti-homogalacturonan monoclonal antibodies lm7, jim5 and jim7. the selective inhibition of these antibodies by different haptens provides insight into the structures of the partially methyl-esterified pectin epitopes of these widely used monoclonal antibodies.
in chronic kidney disease (ckd), indoxyl sulfate, a uremic toxin, accumulates in serum, and the expression of angiotensinogen (agt) is upregulated in renal proximal tubular cells. the present study aimed to determine the relationship between indoxyl sulfate and the upregulation of agt expression in proximal tubular cells. indoxyl sulfate induced expression of agt in rat renal cortex and in cultured human proximal tubular cells (hk-2). in proximal tubular cells, indoxyl sulfate induced phosphorylation of camp response element-binding protein (creb) on ser-133, and small interfering rna (sirna) specific to creb inhibited indoxyl sulfate-induced agt expression. our previous study demonstrated that indoxyl sulfate activated nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) through reactive oxygen species (ros) production. nf-κb inhibitors (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and isohelenin), nf-κb p65 sirna, an antioxidant [n-acetylcysteine (nac)], and a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph) oxidase inhibitor [diphenyleneiodonium (dpi)] suppressed indoxyl sulfate-induced agt expression. both nac and dpi suppressed indoxyl sulfate-induced expression of nf-κb p65 and creb. creb sirna suppressed indoxyl sulfate-induced nf-κb p65 expression, whereas both nf-κb inhibitors and nf-κb p65 sirna prevented indoxyl sulfate-induced creb expression. furthermore, we focused on the expression of nadph oxidase 4 (nox4), because indoxyl sulfate induced nox4 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells. indoxyl sulfate induced the expression of nox4 in proximal tubular cells, which was suppressed by nac, dpi, nf-κb inhibitors, nf-κb p65 sirna, and creb sirna. taken together, creb, nf-κb, and nox4 coordinately upregulate indoxyl sulfate-induced agt expression in proximal tubular cells. background previously, we demonstrated that indoxyl sulphate (is), a uraemic toxin, induced aortic calcification in hypertensive rats. this study aimed to determine if is induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ros) and the expression of osteoblast-specific proteins in human aortic smooth muscle cells (hasmcs).   methods in order to achieve these goals, hasmcs were incubated with is. ros were detected using probes with a fluorescence detector. the expression of alkaline phosphatase (alp), osteopontin and organic anion transporters (oat1, oat3) was studied by western blotting. the expression of core binding factor 1 (cbfa1), alp, osteopontin and nadph oxidases (nox1, nox2 and nox4) was analysed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). knockdown of nox4 was performed by rna interference (rnai).   results is induced ros generation and the expression of nox4, cbfa1, alp and osteopontin in hasmcs. a nadph oxidase inhibitor and antioxidants inhibited is-induced ros production and mrna expression of cbfa1 and alp. knockdown of nox4 using small interfering rna (sirna) inhibited is-induced ros production and mrna expression of cbfa1, alp and osteopontin. oat3 was expressed in hasmcs.   conclusions is induces ros generation by upregulating nox4, and the expression of osteoblast-specific proteins such as cbfa1, alp and osteopontin in hasmcs.
next-generation sequencing (ngs) is a powerful platform for identifying cancer mutations. routine clinical adoption of ngs requires optimized quality control metrics to ensure accurate results. to assess the robustness of our clinical ngs pipeline, we analyzed the results of 304 solid tumor and hematologic malignancy specimens tested simultaneously by ngs and one or more targeted single-gene tests (egfr, kras, braf, npm1, flt3, and jak2). for samples that passed our validated tumor percentage and dna quality and quantity thresholds, there was perfect concordance between ngs and targeted single-gene tests with the exception of two flt3 internal tandem duplications that fell below the stringent pre-established reporting threshold but were readily detected by manual inspection. in addition, ngs identified clinically significant mutations not covered by single-gene tests. these findings confirm ngs as a reliable platform for routine clinical use when appropriate quality control metrics, such as tumor percentage and dna quality cutoffs, are in place. based on our findings, we suggest a simple workflow that should facilitate adoption of clinical oncologic ngs services at other institutions. context the higher throughput and lower per-base cost of next-generation sequencing (ngs) as compared to sanger sequencing has led to its rapid adoption in clinical testing. the number of laboratories offering ngs-based tests has also grown considerably in the past few years, despite the fact that specific clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988/college of american pathologists (cap) laboratory standards had not yet been developed to regulate this technology.   objective to develop a checklist for clinical testing using ngs technology that sets standards for the analytic wet bench process and for bioinformatics or "dry bench" analyses. as ngs-based clinical tests are new to diagnostic testing and are of much greater complexity than traditional sanger sequencing-based tests, there is an urgent need to develop new regulatory standards for laboratories offering these tests.   design to develop the necessary regulatory framework for ngs and to facilitate appropriate adoption of this technology for clinical testing, cap formed a committee in 2011, the ngs work group, to deliberate upon the contents to be included in the checklist. results . -a total of 18 laboratory accreditation checklist requirements for the analytic wet bench process and bioinformatics analysis processes have been included within cap's molecular pathology checklist (mol).   conclusions this report describes the important issues considered by the cap committee during the development of the new checklist requirements, which address documentation, validation, quality assurance, confirmatory testing, exception logs, monitoring of upgrades, variant interpretation and reporting, incidental findings, data storage, version traceability, and data transfer confidentiality.
bacteriophages have been suggested as an alternative approach to reduce the amount of pathogens in various applications. bacteriophages of various specificity and virulence were isolated as a means of controlling food-borne pathogens. we studied the interaction of bacteriophages with bacillus species, which are very often persistent in industrial applications such as food production due to their antibiotic resistance and spore formation. a comparative study using electron microscopy, pfge, and sds-page as well as determination of host range, ph and temperature resistance, adsorption rate, latent time, and phage burst size was performed on three phages of the myoviridae family and one phage of the siphoviridae family which infected bacillus subtilis strains. the phages are morphologically different and characterized by icosahedral heads and contractile (sioφ, subω, and spoσ phages) or noncontractile (arπ phage) tails. the genomes of sioφ and subω are composed of 154 kb. the capsid of sioφ is composed of four proteins. bacteriophages spoσ and arπ have genome sizes of 25 kbp and 40 kbp, respectively. both phages as well as subω phage have 14 proteins in their capsids. phages sioφ and spoσ are resistant to high temperatures and to the acid (4.0) and alkaline (9.0 and 10.0) ph. prokaryote viruses include 14 officially accepted families and at least five other potential families awaiting classification. approximately 5,500 prokaryote viruses have been examined in the electron microscope. classification has a predictive value and is invaluable to control experimental techniques and results. in describing viruses, the choice of methods depends on structure and taxonomical position of viruses. the study of isometric, filamentous, and pleomorphic viruses requires more detailed investigations than that of tailed species.
background surgical site infections (ssis) cause severe morbidity and are associated with tremendous health costs. skin antisepsis (cleansing) with chlorhexidine and alcohol solutions has demonstrated superiority to povidone-iodine in a variety of surgical interventions. our objective was to determine if chlorhexidine and alcohol antisepsis protocol reduces the rate of ssis in elective gynecological laparotomies compared with povidone-iodine antisepsis.   methods this retrospective study was carried out at the department of gynecology in a tertiary medical center in tel aviv. patients undergoing elective gynecological laparotomies during two periods of time and who were treated with two different antisepsis protocols were included. the protocols for antisepsis were povidone-iodine 10% scrub followed by 10% povidone-iodine in 65% alcohol (n = 145) and chlorhexidine 2% followed by 70% alcohol (n = 111). the rate of ssis as defined by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), and the risk factors for the occurrence of ssis were calculated.   results antisepsis with chlorhexidine and alcohol was associated with a reduction in the overall rate of ssis from 14.6% to 4.5% compared with the povidone-iodine protocol (p = 0.011). the two groups of patients were similar in regard to baseline characteristics and medical history. surgical procedures as well as the type of cut, drains, and tension suture use were similar in the two groups. patients with ssis tended to be older and heavier. risk factors found to be associated with ssis were hypertension, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm), immunodeficiency, and the use of the povidone-iodine antisepsis protocol.   conclusions this retrospective study demonstrates that antisepsis with chlorhexidine and alcohol was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of ssis compared to povidone-iodine antisepsis in patients undergoing elective gynecological laparotomies. this is of extreme clinical importance, as a change in antisepsis protocol can significantly reduce the morbidity and healthcare costs associated with patients undergoing elective gynecological surgery. objective the purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of chlorhexidine and povidone iodine for cleansing the operative field for vaginal surgery.   study design this was a randomized controlled trial that compared 10% povidone iodine and 4% chlorhexidine gluconate as surgical scrubs. our primary end point was the proportion of contaminated specimens (defined as total bacterial colony counts of >/=5000 colony-forming units) per group found throughout the surgical procedures. all patients received standard infection prophylaxis that included preoperative intravenous antibiotics. immediately before antibiotic administration and baseline aerobic and anaerobic cultures of the vaginal flora were obtained, which were followed by cultures at 30 minutes after the surgical scrub and hourly thereafter throughout each patient's surgery.   results a total of 50 patients were enrolled between october 2002 and september 2003. there were no differences between the povidone iodine (n = 27) and chlorhexidine (n = 23) groups with respect to age, race, exogenous hormone use, body mass index, gravity, parity, preoperative mean colony counts, or operative time. among the first set of intraoperative specimens (which were obtained 30 minutes after the surgical scrub), 63% of the cultures (17/27) from the povidone iodine group and 22% of the cultures (5/23) from the chlorhexidine group were classified as contaminated ( p = .003; relative risk, 6.12; 95% ci, 1.7, 21.6). subsequent cultures failed to demonstrate significant differences.   conclusion chlorhexidine gluconate was more effective than povidone iodine in decreasing the bacterial colony counts that were found in the operative field for vaginal hysterectomy.
purpose – the purpose of this paper is to investigate the behavioral intentions of business-to-business (b2b) sales managers to use mobile customer relationship management (crm) systems in the course of their day-to-day activities. design/methodology/approach – an extended technology acceptance model (tam) of mobile crm system adoption is developed and tested with data from 105 international sales managers representing five b2b companies. findings – the study extends the tam framework with three additional constructs derived from mobile technology and sales force automation literature, namely personal innovativeness in the domain of it, perceived risk, and perceived reachability. the model demonstrates that personal innovativeness and perceived reachability have significant effects on the tam framework. research limitations/implications – the relatively small sample size limits the generalization of the results. practical implications – sales managers’ intention to adopt mobile crm can be explained by the... this research represents a theoretical extension of the technology acceptance model (tam), which is researchers have used to explain technologies’ perceived usefulness and individuals intention to use it. the authors developed a model, referred to as the mobile wireless technology acceptance model (mwtam), to test the relationship between theoretical constructs spanning technological influence processes (perceived ubiquity, and perceived reachability) and cognitive influence processes (job relevance, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use) and their impact on behavioral intention. mwtam is assessed using data collected from an online survey and analyzed using amos 5.0. results provide evidence to support mwtam as both the technological and cognitive influence processes accounted for 58.7% of the variance explained in an individual’s behavioral intention toward using mobile wireless technology. additionally, the path coefficients between constructs ranged from 0.241 to 0.572 providing further evidence to support the theoretical extension of tam.
the development of the human insula was studied in the foetuses from 21 to 32 gestation weeks, using silver staining, immunohistochemistry of proliferative cell nuclear antigen (pcna), activated caspase-3, and tdt-mediated dutp-biotin nick end labeling (tunel) techniques. to test whether the insula also has a significant role in psychiatry behavior, we also mapped the major receptor of serotonin, 5ht-2a, in the developing insula as well. opercular formation was evident by 21 weeks gestation. at this time, the cortical layers in the insula had started to organize, with silver impregnated pyramidal and stellate cells demonstrated various processes. by 25 gestation weeks, gyri in the insula were observed. pcna positive cells decreased in density from 21 gestation weeks onwards while an increase of tunel positive cells was evident from 25 to 32 weeks of gestation. activated capase-3 positive cells were detected in the insula, along with tunel positive cells, confirming possibly apoptosis. serotonin 2a receptor appeared robustly in the 31/32 gestation week specimens. our study showed early differentiation in the insula, when compared with other parts of the human cortex in the literature. in addition, proliferation as well as apoptosis were demonstration. expression of 5ht (serotonin) 2a receptor positive cells in development was indicative of the insula as a significant psychiatric center. stress- and drug-related cues are major factors contributing to high rates of relapse in addictive disorders. brain imaging studies have begun to identify neural correlates of stress and drug cue-induced craving states. findings indicate considerable overlap in neural circuits involved in processing stress and drug cues with activity in the corticostriatal limbic circuitry underlying both affective and reward processing. more recent efforts have begun to identify the relationships between neural activity during stress and drug cue exposure and drug relapse outcomes. findings suggest medial prefrontal, anterior and posterior cingulate, striatal and posterior insula regions to be associated with relapse outcomes. altered function in these brain regions is associated with stress-induced and drug cue-induced craving states and an increased susceptibility to relapse. such alterations can serve as markers to identify relapse propensity and a more severe course of addiction. efficacy of pharmacological and behavioral treatments that specifically target stress and cue-induced craving and arousal responses may also be assessed via alterations in these brain correlates.
the ate1 arginyltransferase (r-transferase) is a component of the n-end rule pathway, which recognizes proteins containing n-terminal degradation signals called n-degrons, polyubiquitylates these proteins, and thereby causes their degradation by the proteasome. ate1 arginylates n-terminal asp, glu, or (oxidized) cys. the resulting n-terminal arg is recognized by ubiquitin ligases of the n-end rule pathway. in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the separase-mediated cleavage of the scc1/rad21/mcd1 cohesin subunit generates a c-terminal fragment that bears n-terminal arg and is destroyed by the n-end rule pathway without a requirement for arginylation. in contrast, the separase-mediated cleavage of rec8, the mammalian meiotic cohesin subunit, yields a fragment bearing n-terminal glu, a substrate of the ate1 r-transferase. here we constructed and used a germ cell-confined ate1−/− mouse strain to analyze the separase-generated c-terminal fragment of rec8. we show that this fragment is a short-lived n-end rule substrate, that its degradation requires n-terminal arginylation, and that male ate1−/− mice are nearly infertile, due to massive apoptotic death of ate1−/− spermatocytes during the metaphase of meiosis i. these effects of ate1 ablation are inferred to be caused, at least in part, by the failure to destroy the c-terminal fragment of rec8 in the absence of n-terminal arginylation. the n‐end rule relates the regulation of the in vivo half‐life of a protein to the identity of its n‐terminal residue. degradation signals (degrons) that are targeted by the n‐end rule pathway include a set called n‐degrons. the main determinant of an n‐degron is a destabilizing n‐terminal residue of a protein. in eukaryotes, the n‐end rule pathway is a part of the ubiquitin system and consists of two branches, the ac/n‐end rule and the arg/n‐end rule pathways. the ac/n‐end rule pathway targets proteins containing nα‐terminally acetylated (nt‐acetylated) residues. the arg/n‐end rule pathway recognizes unacetylated n‐terminal residues and involves n‐terminal arginylation. together, these branches target for degradation a majority of cellular proteins. for example, more than 80% of human proteins are cotranslationally nt‐acetylated. thus, most proteins harbor a specific degradation signal, termed acn‐degron, from the moment of their birth. specific n‐end rule pathways are also present in prokaryotes and in mitochondria. enzymes that produce n‐degrons include methionine‐aminopeptidases, caspases, calpains, nt‐acetylases, nt‐amidases, arginyl‐transferases, and leucyl‐transferases. regulated degradation of specific proteins by the n‐end rule pathway mediates a legion of physiological functions, including the sensing of heme, oxygen, and nitric oxide; selective elimination of misfolded proteins; the regulation of dna repair, segregation, and condensation; the signaling by g proteins; the regulation of peptide import, fat metabolism, viral and bacterial infections, apoptosis, meiosis, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, and cardiovascular development; and the functioning of adult organs, including the pancreas and the brain. discovered 25 years ago, this pathway continues to be a fount of biological insights.
cold-active lipases are of significant interest as biocatalysts in industrial processes. we have identified a lipase that displayed activity towards long carbon-chain-p-nitrophenyl substrates (c12–c18) at 25 °c from the culture supernatant of an antarctic penicillium expansum strain assigned p. expansum sm3. zymography revealed a protein band of around 30 kda with activity towards olive oil. dna fragments of a lipase gene designated as lippe were isolated from the genomic dna of p. expansum sm3 by genomic walking pcr. subsequently, the complete genomic lippe gene was amplified using gene-specific primers designed from the 5′- and 3′-regions. reverse transcription pcr was used to amplify the lippe cdna. the deduced amino acid sequence consisted of 285 residues that included a predicted signal peptide. three peptides identified by lc/ms/ms analysis of the proteins in the culture supernatant of p. expansum were also present in the deduced amino acid sequence of the lippe gene suggesting that this gene encoded the lipase identified by initial zymogram activity analysis. full analysis of the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the lippe gene encodes a novel p. expansum lipase. the lippe gene was expressed in e. coli for further characterization of the enzyme with a view of assessing its suitability for industrial applications. lipases are acyl hydrolases that play a key role in fat digestion by cleaving long-chain triglycerides into polar lipids. due to an opposite polarity between the enzyme (hydrophilic) and their substrates (lipophilic), lipase reaction occurs at the interface between the aqueous and the oil phases. hence, interfaces are the key spots for lipase biocatalysis and an appropriate site for modulating lipolysis. surprisingly enough, knowledge about the effects of the interfacial composition on lipase catalysis is still limited and only described by the term "interfacial quality". recent systematic studies based on a biophysical approach allowed for the first time to show the effects of the interfacial microenvironment on lipase catalysis. these studies demonstrate that lipase activity as a function of interfacial composition is more attributed to substrate inaccessibility rather than to enzyme denaturation or inactivation, as it is often hypothesized. a detailed analysis of the interfacial properties of all compounds involved in triglyceride digestion revealed that lipolysis is a self-regulated reaction. this feedback mechanism can be explored as a new avenue to control lipase catalysis. to substantiate this hypothesis, oil hydrolysis in a model gastro-intestinal system was performed, which can be seen as an interfacial engineering approach to enzyme reactivity control. the presented characterization of the interfacial composition and its consequences provide a new approach for the understanding of lipase reactions at interfaces with direct impact on biotechnological and health care applications.
the age-adjusted prevalence of peripheral arterial disease in the us population has been estimated to approach 12%. the clinical consequences of occlusive peripheral arterial disease include pain on walking (claudication), pain at rest, and loss of tissue integrity in the distal limbs; the latter may ultimately lead to amputation of a portion of the lower extremity. surgical bypass techniques and percutaneous catheter-based interventions may successfully reperfuse the limbs of certain patients with peripheral arterial disease. in many patients, however, the anatomic extent and distribution of arterial occlusion is too severe to permit relief of pain and healing of ischemic ulcers. no effective medical therapy is available for the treatment of such patients, for many of whom amputation represents the only hope for alleviation of symptoms. the ultimate failure of medical treatment and procedural revascularization in significant numbers of patients has led to attempts to develop alternative therapies for ischemic disease. these strategies include administration of angiogenic cytokines, either as recombinant protein or as gene therapy, and more recently, to investigations of stem/progenitor cell therapy. the purpose of this review is to provide an outline of the preclinical basis for angiogenic and stem cell therapies, review the clinical research that has been done, summarize the lessons learned, identify gaps in knowledge, and suggest a course toward successfully addressing an unmet medical need in a large and growing patient population. background— embryonic stem (es) cells are distinguished by their capacity for self-renewal and pluripotency. here we characterize the differentiation of es cell–derived endothelial cells (esc-ecs), use molecular imaging techniques to examine their survival in vivo, and determine the therapeutic efficacy of esc-ecs for restoration of cardiac function after ischemic injury. methods and results— murine es cells were transfected with a construct composed of a vascular endothelial cadherin promoter driving enhanced green fluorescence protein (pve-cadherin-egfp). differentiation of es cells to ecs was detected by facs analysis using flk-1 (early ec marker at day 4) and ve-cadherin (late ec marker at day 8). after isolation, these esc-ecs express endothelial cell markers similar to adult mouse lung endothelial cells, form vascular-like channels, and incorporate dii-labeled acetylated low-density lipoprotein (dii-ac-ldl). for in vivo imaging, es cells were transduced with an ubiquitin promoter driving firefly luciferase and monomeric red fluorescence protein (pub-fluc-mrfp). a robust correlation exists between fluc signals and cell numbers by ex vivo imaging analysis (r2=0.98) and by in vitro enzyme assay (r2=0.94). afterward, 5×105 esc-ecs or pbs (as control) was injected into the hearts of mice undergoing lad ligation (n=15 per group). bioluminescence imaging showed longitudinal survival of transplanted esc-ecs for ≈8 weeks. echocardiogram demonstrated significant functional improvement in the esc-ec group compared with control (p=0.04). finally, postmortem analysis confirmed increased presence of small capillaries and venules in the infarcted zones by cd31 staining. conclusions— this is the first study to track the fate and function of transplanted esc-ecs in the heart. with further validation, these esc-ecs could become a valuable source of cell therapy for induction of angiogenesis in the treatment of myocardial ischemia.
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is associated with different impairment profiles in the symptom domains of hyperactivity/impulsivity and/or inattention. an additional symptom domain of sluggish cognitive tempo (sct) has also been proposed. although there is a degree of correlation between the sct symptom domain and inattention, it has been proposed as a distinct disorder independent of adhd. the objective of this study was to examine the neural substrates of cue-related preparatory processes associated with sct symptoms versus inattentive symptoms in a group of adolescents with adhd. we also compared cue-related effects in the entire adhd group compared with a group of typically developing (td) peers. a modified cued flanker paradigm and fmri examined brain activity associated with attention preparation and motor response preparation. between group contrasts between the adhd and td group revealed significant hypoactivity in the adhd group during general attention preparation in the supplementary motor area (sma) and in the right superior parietal lobe (spl) during response preparation. in the adhd group, greater numbers of sct symptoms were associated with hypoactivity in the left spl to cues in general whereas greater numbers of inattentive symptoms were associated with greater activity in the sma to cues that provided no information and less activity in the thalamus during response preparation. hypoactivity in the spl with increasing sct symptoms may be associated with impaired reorienting or shifting of attention. altered activity in the sma and thalamus with increasing inattention may be associated with a general problem with response preparation, which may also reflect inefficient processing of the response preparation cue. our results support a degree of differentiation between sct and inattentive symptom profiles within adolescents with adhd. objective directed attention, the ability to allocate and direct attention toward a salient stimulus, is impaired in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). this construct is often assessed with target detection or oddball tasks, and individuals with adhd perform poorly on such tasks. however, to date, the specific brain structures or neural mechanisms underlying target detection dysfunction in individuals with adhd have not been identified. the authors' goal was to investigate neural correlates of target detection dysfunction in adhd using event-related fmri.   method behavioral and brain activation data were collected while subjects performed a visual oddball task. participants included 14 right-handed male adolescents with adhd (combined type) and 12 typically developing age- and handedness-matched male comparison subjects.   results individuals with adhd made significantly more errors of commission than comparison subjects. further, relative to comparison subjects, individuals with adhd showed significantly less activation in the bilateral parietal lobes (including the superior parietal gyrus and supramarginal and angular gyri of the inferior parietal lobe), right precuneus, and thalamus.   conclusions adolescents with adhd demonstrated significant impairments in their ability to direct and allocate attentional resources. these difficulties were associated with significant aberrations in the parietal attentional system, which is known to play a significant role in attention shifting and detecting specific or salient targets. thus, dysfunction in the parietal attentional system may play a significant role in the behavioral phenotype of adhd.
the dnase test is a simple, economical method that has traditionally been used as a supplemental test to identify pathogenic staphylococcus. this test also aids in the differentiation of closely-related genera within the klebsiella-enterobacter-serratia division of enterobacteriaceae and several other pathogens, including screening of c. diphtheriae. currently dnase activity of microorganisms was tested using dnase agar plate methods. these tests have some drawbacks including the necessity of the extensive time to see the results of dnase activity of bacteria. in here, we developed a new method which is simple, rapid, inexpensive and applicable to examine dnase activity of any bacteria. in this method, simply, bacteria is added to the broth medium containing dna and followed for the dna degradation caused by the dnase of bacteria by running in agarose gel. this method we called dnase tube test showed dna degradation as fast as in half an hour depending on the dnase activity of the bacteria. some years ago a “desoxyribonuclease” was found’ in the culture medium of staphylococcus aureus that was unaffected by heating in a boiling-water bath. the enzyme has proved useful in end-group studies of desoxyribonucleic acids and fragments thereof, because the products of its action bear the singly esterified phosphate a t the 3’ position?, as was first pointed out by j. d. smith,4 ribonucleic acid is also attacked, again only a t the 5’ phosphodiester bond, giving rise to nucleoside 3‘-phosphates in addition to larger, homologous fragments. other similarities between the desoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease activities itre the unusual stability of the enzyme,” the ph optimum of 8.6; and the requirement for calcium ion’’ at about 0.01 &/i concentration. it appears that, when the enzyme is in the culture medium, it can digest extracellular nucleic acids5 which, in default of enzyme action, accumulate as part of a slime layer. the enzyme is salted out of the culture medium after boiling and washed with 2.5 per cent trichloroacetic acid saturated with ammonium chloride, followed by 83 per cent ethanol.’ since the washing is carried out at room temperature, any traces of relatively labile contaminating enzymes that survived the boiling probably would be destroyed. terminal digests of natural nucleic acids are complex mixtures (figure 1). the values, perhaps, match as well as could be expected in view of the initial base differences in the two substrates, except for a marked, unexplained discrepancy between guanylic acid and desoxyguanylic acid. end-group determinations2, 6 , showed that in several dinucleotidc fractions ;i single sequence accounted for 90 per cent or more of the material. the favored sequences were: desoxyadenylyl desoxycytidylic acid (apcp) and desoxyadenylyl desoxyguanylic acid (apgp) in both the desoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid digests, and desoxythymidylyl desoxycytidylic acid (tpcp) and desoxythymidylyl desoxyguanylic acid (tpgp) in the desoxyribonucleic acid digest; sequence was not determined in other ribodinucleotide fractions. however, both desoxythymidylyl desoxyadenylic acid (tpap) and desoxyadenylyl desoxythymidylic acid (aptp) were well represented (about two parts of the former to one of the latter). there are also trinucleotides or larger fragments that may contain any base of the original substrate. a possible clue to the reason for their presence in the digests is the fact that they are absent after digestion of certain synthetic polynucleotides (the only ones investigated so far) which lack cytosine, uracil, and guanine (figure 2). the experiment with polyadcnylic acid indicat etl t ha t the sequence apa must be both susceptible to cleavage (othcrwise there would be no digest ion)
long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) play key roles in human diseases, including cancer. functional studies of the lncrna hotair (hox transcript antisense rna) provide compelling evidence for therapeutic targeting of hotair in cancer, but targeting lncrnas in vivo has proven to be difficult. in the current study, we describe a peptide nucleic acids (pna)-based approach to block the ability of hotair to interact with ezh2 and subsequently inhibit hotair-ezh2 activity and resensitize resistant ovarian tumors to platinum. treatment of hotair-overexpressing ovarian and breast cancer cell lines with pnas decreased invasion and increased chemotherapy sensitivity. furthermore, the mechanism of action correlated with reduced nuclear factor-kappab (nf-κb) activation and decreased expression of nf-κb target genes matrix metalloprotease 9 and interleukin 6. to deliver the anti-lncrna to the acidic (ph approximately 6) tumor microenvironment, pnas were conjugated to ph-low insertion peptide (phlip). treatment of mice harboring platinum-resistant ovarian tumor xenografts with phlip-pna constructs suppressed hotair activity, reduced tumor formation and improved survival. this first report on phlip-pna lncrna targeting solid tumors in vivo suggests a novel cancer therapeutic approach. long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) are key regulators of chromatin state, yet the nature and sites of rna-chromatin interaction are mostly unknown. here we introduce chromatin isolation by rna purification (chirp), where tiling oligonucleotides retrieve specific lncrnas with bound protein and dna sequences, which are enumerated by deep sequencing. chirp-seq of three lncrnas reveal that rna occupancy sites in the genome are focal, sequence-specific, and numerous. drosophila rox2 rna occupies male x-linked gene bodies with increasing tendency toward the 3' end, peaking at ces sites. human telomerase rna terc occupies telomeres and wnt pathway genes. hotair lncrna preferentially occupies a ga-rich dna motif to nucleate broad domains of polycomb occupancy and histone h3 lysine 27 trimethylation. hotair occupancy occurs independently of ezh2, suggesting the order of rna guidance of polycomb occupancy. chirp-seq is generally applicable to illuminate the intersection of rna and chromatin with newfound precision genome wide.
trypanosoma cruzi causes chagas disease, which is a neglected tropical disease that produces severe pathology and mortality. the mechanisms by which the parasite invades cells are not well elucidated. we recently reported that t. cruzi up-regulates the expression of thrombospondin-1 (tsp-1) to enhance the process of cellular invasion. here we characterize a novel tsp-1 interaction with t. cruzi that enhances cellular infection. we show that labeled tsp-1 interacts specifically with the surface of t. cruzi trypomastigotes. we used tsp-1 to pull down interacting parasite surface proteins that were identified by mass spectrometry. we also show that full length tsp-1 and the n-terminal domain of tsp-1 (ntsp) interact with t. cruzi surface calreticulin (tccrt) and other surface proteins. pre-exposure of recombinant ntsp or tsp-1 to t. cruzi significantly enhances cellular infection of wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts (mef) compared to the c-terminal domain of tsp-1, e3t3c1. in addition, blocking tccrt with antibodies significantly inhibits the enhancement of cellular infection mediated by the tccrt-tsp-1 interaction. taken together, our findings indicate that tsp-1 interacts with tccrt on the surface of t. cruzi through the ntsp domain and that this interaction enhances cellular infection. thus surface tccrt is a virulent factor that enhances the pathogenesis of t. cruzi infection through tsp-1, which is up-regulated by the parasite. calreticulin, a calcium-binding protein that is highly conserved in its multiple functions, is present in a wide spectrum of subcellular compartments in virtually every cell of higher organisms. in this article, we propose a dual role for parasite calreticulin, with emphasis on the trypanosoma cruzi model. by modulating the vertebrate complement system, calreticulin might provide the parasite with an effective immune-escape mechanism. alternatively, by inhibiting angiogenesis, the parasite molecule might protect the host from ongoing neoplasic aggressions. many questions are still unanswered, particularly those regarding the consequences that these interactions could have in vivo for both the parasite and the host.
objective:to assess the efficacy of topical chlorhexidine for prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) in a meta-analysis. data source:computerized pubmed and medline search supplemented by manual searches for relevant articles. study selection:randomized controlled trials evaluating efficacy of topical chlorhexidine applied to the oropharynx vs. placebo or standard care for prevention of vap. data extraction:data were extracted on patient population, inclusion and exclusion criteria, diagnostic criteria for vap, form and concentration of topical chlorhexidine used, incidence of vap, and overall mortality. data synthesis:data on incidence of vap and mortality were abstracted as dichotomous variables. pooled estimates of the relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were obtained using the dersimonian and laird random effects model and the mantel-haenszel fixed effects model. heterogeneity was assessed using the cochran q statistic and i2. subgroup analyses were used to explore heterogeneity. results:seven randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. topical chlorhexidine resulted in a reduced incidence of vap (relative risk, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.96; p = .02) using a fixed effects model. using the more conservative random effects model, the point estimate was similar (relative risk, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.47–1.04; p = .07), but the results failed to achieve statistical significance. the i2 test showed moderate heterogeneity. subgroup analysis showed that the benefit of chlorhexidine was most marked in cardiac surgery patients (relative risk, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.17–0.98; p = .04). there was no mortality benefit with chlorhexidine although the sample size was small. conclusions:our analysis showed that topical chlorhexidine is beneficial in preventing vap; the benefit is most marked in cardiac surgery patients. a large randomized trial is needed to determine the impact of topical chlorhexidine on mortality. objective the purpose of this study was to describe the effect of an early post-intubation oral application of chlorhexidine gluconate on oral microbial flora and ventilator-associated pneumonia.   methods thirty-four intubated patients were randomly assigned to chlorhexidine gluconate by spray or swab or to control group. oral cultures were done at study admission, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours, whereas the clinical pulmonary infection score (cpis) was documented at study admission, 48, and 72 hours.   results reductions in oral culture scores (less growth) were only found in the treatment groups (swab and spray); no reduction was found in the control group. there was a trend for fewer positive cultures in the combined treatment groups. the mean cpis for the control group increased to a level indicating pneumonia (4.7 to 6.6), whereas the cpis for the treatment group increased only slightly (5.17 to 5.57).   conclusions trends in the data suggest that use of chlorhexidine gluconate in the early post-intubation period may mitigate or delay the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
abstract objective: to compare clinical outcomes and hospital resource utilization of infants who had peripherally inserted central catheters removed early versus retained following diagnosis of central line-associated bloodstream infection. study design: in a single centre retrospective cohort study, we compared outcomes of infants who had peripherally inserted central catheters removed early versus retained after diagnosis of central line-associated bloodstream infection. mortality, cardio-respiratory deterioration, use of blood products and antibiotics were compared between groups. results: over a 10-year period, of the 119 eligible infants, 38 had peripherally inserted central catheters removed early and 81 had catheters retained after diagnosis of central line-associated bloodstream infection. baseline demographics, illness severity at onset of sepsis and distribution of organisms were similar between the groups. infants in “catheter–retained” group required longer antibiotic usage (17 ± 9 versus 13 ± 6 days; p = 0.025) and more frequent sequential positive blood cultures [31/81 (47%) versus 8/38 (22%), p = 0.014). infants with gram-negative bacteremia demonstrated higher mortality when catheters were retained [43% (9/21) versus 7% (1/14); p = 0.028]. conclusions: retaining peripherally inserted central catheters after diagnosis of central line-associated bloodstream infection was associated with longer duration of bacteremia and prolonged exposure to systemic antibiotics as well as increased mortality in gram-negative bacteremia. objectives patients admitted to neonatal intensive care units (nicus) are at high risk of nosocomial infection. we conducted a national multicenter assessment of nosocomial infections in nicus to determine the prevalence of infections, describe associated risk factors, and help focus prevention efforts.   study design we conducted a point prevalence survey of nosocomial infections in 29 pediatric prevention network nicus. patients present on the survey date were included. data were collected on underlying diagnoses, therapeutic interventions/treatments, infections, and outcomes.   results of the 827 patients surveyed, 94 (11.4%) had 116 nicu-acquired infections: bloodstream (52.6%), lower respiratory tract (12.9%), ear-nose-throat (8.6%), or urinary tract infections (8.6%). infants with infections were of significantly lower birth weight (median 1006 g [range 441 to 4460 g] vs 1589 g [range 326 to 5480 g]; p <.001) and had longer median durations of stay than those without infections (88 days [range 8 to 279 days] vs 32 days [range 1 to 483 days]; p <.001). most common pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. patients with central intravascular catheters (relative risk = 3.81, ci 2.32-6.25; p <.001) or receiving total parenteral nutrition (relative risk = 5.72, ci 3.45-9.49; p <.001) were at greater risk of bloodstream infection.   conclusions this study documents the high prevalence of nosocomial infections in patients in nicus and the urgent need for more effective prevention interventions.
a previous report by this laboratory demonstrated that bacterial iron chelator (siderophore) triggers inflammatory signals, including the production of cxc chemokine il-8, in human intestinal epithelial cells (iecs). microarray-based gene expression profiling revealed that iron chelator also induces macrophage inflammatory protein 3 α (mip-3α)/ cc chemokine-ligand 20 (ccl20). as ccl20 is chemotactic for the cells involved in host adaptive immunity, this suggests that iron chelator may stimulate iecs to have the capacity to link mucosal innate and adaptive immunity. the basal medium from iron chelator deferoxamine (dfo)-treated ht-29 monolayers was as chemotactic as recombinant human ccl20 at equivalent concentrations to attract ccr6+ cells. the increase of ccl20 protein secretion appeared to correspond to that of ccl20 mrna levels, as determined by real-time quantitative rt-pcr. the efficacy of dfo at inducing ccl20 mrna was also observed in human pbmcs and in thp-1 cells, but not in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. interestingly, unlike other proinflammatory cytokines, such as tnf-α and il-1β, a time-dependent experiment revealed that dfo slowly induces ccl20, suggesting a novel mechanism of action. a pharmacologic study also revealed that multiple signaling pathways are differentially involved in ccl20 production by dfo, while some of those pathways are not involved in tnf-α-induced ccl20 production. collectively, these results demonstrate that, in addition to some bacterial products known to induce host adaptive immune responses, direct chelation of host iron by infected bacteria may also contribute to the initiation of host adaptive immunity in the intestinal mucosa. dendritic cells (dcs) form a network comprising different populations that initiate and differentially regulate immune responses. langerhans cells (lcs) represent a unique population of dcs colonizing epithelium, and we present here observations suggesting that macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-3α plays a central role in lc precursor recruitment into the epithelium during inflammation. (a) among dc populations, mip-3α was the most potent chemokine inducing the selective migration of in vitro–generated cd34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell–derived lc precursors and skin lcs in accordance with the restricted mip-3α receptor (cc chemokine receptor 6) expression to these cells. (b) mip-3α was mainly produced by epithelial cells, and the migration of lc precursors induced by the supernatant of activated skin keratinocytes was completely blocked with an antibody against mip-3α. (c) in vivo, mip-3α was selectively produced at sites of inflammation as illustrated in tonsils and lesional psoriatic skin where mip-3α upregulation appeared associated with an increase in lc turnover. (d) finally, the secretion of mip-3α was strongly upregulated by cells of epithelial origin after inflammatory stimuli (interleukin 1β plus tumor necrosis factor α) or t cell signals. results of this study suggest a major role of mip-3α in epithelial colonization by lcs under inflammatory conditions and immune disorders, and might open new ways to control epithelial immunity.
monoamines and neuropeptides interact to modulate behavioral plasticity in both vertebrates and invertebrates. in caenorhabditis elegans behavioral state or “mood” is dependent on food availability and is translated by both monoaminergic and peptidergic signaling in the fine-tuning of most behaviors. in the present study, we have examined the interaction of monoamines and peptides on c. elegans aversive behavior mediated by a pair of polymodal, nociceptive, ash sensory neurons. food or serotonin sensitize the ashs and stimulate aversive responses through a pathway requiring the release of nlp-3-encoded neuropeptides from the ashs. peptides encoded by nlp-3 appear to stimulate ash-mediated aversive behavior through the neuropeptide receptor-17 (npr-17) receptor. nlp-3- and npr-17-null animals exhibit identical phenotypes and animals overexpressing either nlp-3 or npr-17 exhibit elevated aversive responses off food that are absent when nlp-3 or npr-17 are overexpressed in npr-17- or nlp-3-null animals, respectively. ash-mediated aversive responses are increased by activating either gαq or gαs in the ashs, with gαs signaling specifically stimulating the release of nlp-3-encoded peptides. in contrast, octopamine appears to inhibit 5-ht stimulation by activating gαo signaling in the ashs that, in turn, inhibits both gαs and gαq signaling and the release of nlp-3-encoded peptides. these results demonstrate that serotonin and octopamine reversibly modulate the activity of the ashs, and highlight the utility of the c. elegans model for defining interactions between monoamines and peptides in individual neurons of complex sensory-mediated circuits. neuropeptides play critical roles in synaptic signaling in all nervous systems. unlike classical neurotransmitters, peptidergic neurotransmitters are encoded as preproproteins that are posttranslationally processed to yield bioactive neuropeptides. to identify novel peptidergic neurotransmitters, the caenorhabditis elegans genome was searched for predicted proteins with the structural hallmarks of neuropeptide preproproteins. thirty-two c. elegans neuropeptide-like protein (nlp) genes were identified. the nlp genes define at least 11 families of putative neuropeptides with unique motifs; similar expressed sequence tags were identified in other invertebrate species for all 11 families. six of these families are defined by putative bioactive motifs (fafa, ggxyamide, mrxamide, lqfamide, lxdxamide, and ggaraf); the remaining five families are related to allatostatin, myomodulin, buccalin/drosulfakinin, orcokinin, and apgwamide neuropeptides (mgl/famide, frpamide, msfamide, gfxgf, and yggwamide families, respectively). most c. elegans nlp gene expression is in neurons. the c. elegans nlp genes and similar genes encoding putative neuropeptides in other species are likely to play diverse roles in nervous system function.
an analysis of networks of graduate-to-faculty hires reveals systematic hiring biases and patterns. the faculty job market plays a fundamental role in shaping research priorities, educational outcomes, and career trajectories among scientists and institutions. however, a quantitative understanding of faculty hiring as a system is lacking. using a simple technique to extract the institutional prestige ranking that best explains an observed faculty hiring network—who hires whose graduates as faculty—we present and analyze comprehensive placement data on nearly 19,000 regular faculty in three disparate disciplines. across disciplines, we find that faculty hiring follows a common and steeply hierarchical structure that reflects profound social inequality. furthermore, doctoral prestige alone better predicts ultimate placement than a u.s. news & world report rank, women generally place worse than men, and increased institutional prestige leads to increased faculty production, better faculty placement, and a more influential position within the discipline. these results advance our ability to quantify the influence of prestige in academia and shed new light on the academic system. networks—an introduction.marke. j.newman. (2010,oxforduniversity press.) $65.38, £35.96 (hardcover), 772 pages. isbn-978-0-19-920665-0. network science or graph theory has its roots in the first half of the 18th century when leonhard euler, a prussian mathematician, analyzed the problem of finding a route through the city of königsberg that crossed every one of the cityʼs seven major bridges once and only once. ever since then, network theory has attracted the interest of mathematicians like the famous paul erdős, who (together with alfréd rényi [2] and independently gilbert [3]) was first to define random graphs in the late 1950s. later, social scientists joined in founding social network theory as a new branch of the field. in the last two decades, an explosion of research into network science has been stimulated by the recent introduction of the small-world [4] and scale-free [1] network paradigms. as a result, the field has become ever more multidisciplinary, and concepts from network theory have become standard knowledge in many areas of the natural and social sciences. examples of fields where network approaches have almost become standard tools are computer science, systems biology, engineering, and physics, just to name a few. at the same time, the knowledge about network theory has become somewhat fragmented: different terminology is used in different fields, and often solutions to problems that have been developed for one set of applications are not readily accessible to practitioners in other areas. with his new booknetworks—an introduction, mark newman aims at bridging this gap. using a consistent terminology, the book provides a summary of the knowledge about the empirical analysis and theory of networks that has been accumulated in this diverse set of disciplines over many years. the book is very successful in this pursuit and gives an excellent introduction to the topic of network theory. not only this, gradually working its way up from introductory content to more advanced topics, the book also provides a neat collection of relevant material for the more advanced reader. a set of problems at the end of most chapters allows the reader to check his or her understanding of the presented material. altogether, i highly recommend this book, not only for the non-specialist reader who wants to understand what network theory is all about, but also for the specialist who wants to use the book as a quick reference or as the basis for an undergraduate or more advanced course taught at a university. after so much praise, let us have a brief look at the content of the book. it basically consists of five parts. the first part highlights the interdisciplinary nature of network applications and discusses examples from four different areas of research: infrastructure networks, social networks, networks linked to the transmission of information, and biological networks. in each of these broad application areas the author explains the most prominent examples and illustrates the relevance of network approaches. the second part of the book is composed of an introduction to the fundamentals of network theory. chapter ii.6 sets out with a series of definitions of various types of networks, followed by the introduction of various metrics generally used to classify networks. chapter ii.8 discusses smallworldness, degree distributions, clustering, and assortative mixes of degrees, and finishes by giving a classification of networks in terms of their macroscopic appearance. having defined network metrics, the next logical step is to think about efficient computer algorithms to evaluate them for a given network. accordingly, the third part of the book gives a very useful summary of some frequently applied computer algorithms. again the chapter starts with a readily accessible introduction to some basics, such as various methods of storing a networks in computer memory. the author then quickly progresses to algorithms for the efficient computation of graph
two mechanisms dominate the clinical pipeline for oligonucleotide-based gene silencing, namely the antisense approach that recruits rnase h to cleave target rna and the rna interference (rnai) approach that recruits the risc complex to cleave target rna. multiple chemical designs can be used to elicit each pathway. we now compare the silencing of the asthma susceptibility gene adam33 in mrc-5 lung fibroblasts using four different classes of gene silencing agents, two that use each mechanism: traditional duplex small interfering rnas (sirnas), single-stranded sirnas (ss-sirnas), locked nucleic acid (lna) gapmer antisense oligonucleotides (asos), and novel hexadecyloxypropyl conjugates of the asos. of these designs, the gapmer asos emerged as lead compounds for silencing adam33 expression: several gapmer asos showed subnanomolar potency when transfected with cationic lipid, and low micromolar potency with no toxicity when delivered gymnotically. the preferential susceptibility of adam33 mrna to silencing by rnase h may be related to the high degree of nuclear retention observed for this mrna. dynamic light scattering data showed that the hexadecyloxypropyl aso conjugates self-assemble m an us cr ip t ac ce pt ed accepted manuscript 2 into clusters. these conjugates showed reduced potency relative to unconjugated asos unless the lipophilic tail was conjugated to the aso using a biocleavable linkage. finally, based on the lead asos from (human) mrc-5 cells, we developed a series of homologous asos targeting mouse adam33 with excellent activity. our work confirms that antisense oligonucleotide-based gene silencing of adam33 is a useful tool for asthma research and therapy. antisense oligonucleotides (asos) can suppress the expression of a target gene by cleaving pre-mrna and/or mature mrna via rnase h1. following the initial endonucleolytic cleavage by rnase h1, the target rnas are degraded by a mechanism that is poorly understood. to better understand this degradation pathway, we depleted the expression of two major 5' to 3' exoribonucleases (xrns), named xrn1 and xrn2, and analyzed the levels of 3' fragments of the target rnas in vitro. we found that the 3' fragments of target pre-mrna generated by aso were almost completely degraded from their 5' ends by nuclear xrn2 after rnase h1-mediated cleavage, whereas the 3' fragments of mature mrna were partially degraded by xrn2. in contrast to aso, small interference rna (sirna) could reduce the expression level of only mature mrna, and the 3' fragment was degraded by cytoplasmic xrn1. our findings indicate that the rnas targeted by rnase h1-dependent aso are rapidly degraded in the nucleus, contrary to the cytoplasmic degradation pathway mediated by sirna.
abstract bleaching (dinoflagellate symbiont loss) is one of the greatest threats facing coral reefs. the functional cnidarian–dinoflagellate symbiosis, which forms coral reefs, is based on the bi-directional exchange of nutrients. during thermal stress this exchange breaks down; however, major gaps remain in our understanding of the roles of free metabolite pools in symbiosis and homeostasis. in this study we applied gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (gc-ms) to explore thermally induced changes in intracellular pools of amino and non-amino organic acids in each partner of the model sea anemone aiptasia sp. and its dinoflagellate symbiont. elevated temperatures (32°c for 6 days) resulted in symbiont photoinhibition and bleaching. thermal stress induced distinct changes in the metabolite profiles of both partners, associated with alterations to central metabolism, oxidative state, cell structure, biosynthesis and signalling. principally, we detected elevated pools of polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) in the symbiont, indicative of modifications to lipogenesis/lysis, membrane structure and nitrogen assimilation. in contrast, reductions of multiple pufas were detected in host pools, indicative of increased metabolism, peroxidation and/or reduced translocation of these groups. accumulations of glycolysis intermediates were also observed in both partners, associated with photoinhibition and downstream reductions in carbohydrate metabolism. correspondingly, we detected accumulations of amino acids and intermediate groups in both partners, with roles in gluconeogenesis and acclimation responses to oxidative stress. these data further our understanding of cellular responses to thermal stress in the symbiosis and generate hypotheses relating to the secondary roles of a number of compounds in homeostasis and heat-stress resistance. summary: thermally induced modifications to free metabolite pools of amino and non-amino organic acids are characterised in a model system for reef-building corals, in both symbiont and host. stable cnidarian-dinoflagellate (genus symbiodinium) endosymbioses depend on the regulation of nutrient transport between symbiodinium populations and their hosts. it has been previously shown that the host cytosol is a nitrogen-deficient environment for the intracellular symbiodinium and may act to limit growth rates of symbionts during the symbiotic association. this study aimed to investigate the cell proliferation, as well as ultrastructural and lipid compositional changes, in free-living symbiodinium spp. (clade b) upon nitrogen (n)-deprivation. the cell proliferation of the n-deprived cells decreased significantly. furthermore, staining with a fluorescent probe, boron dipyrromethane 493/503 (bodipy 493/503), indicated that lipid contents progressively accumulated in the n-deprived cells. lipid analyses further showed that both triacylglycerol (tag) and cholesterol ester (ce) were drastically enriched, with polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa; i.e., docosahexaenoic acid, heneicosapentaenoic acid, and oleic acid) became more abundant. ultrastructural examinations showed that the increase in concentration of these lipid species was due to the accumulation of lipid droplets (lds), a cellular feature that have previously shown to be pivotal in the maintenance of intact endosymbioses. integrity of these stable lds was maintained via electronegative repulsion and steric hindrance possibly provided by their surface proteins. proteomic analyses of these lds identified proteins putatively involved in lipid metabolism, signaling, stress response and energy metabolism. these results suggest that lds production may be an adaptive response that enables symbiodinium to maintain sufficient cellular energy stores for survival under the n-deprived conditions in the host cytoplasm.
we introduce a multi-distance, frequency-domain, near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) method to measure the optical coefficients of two-layered media and the thickness of the top layer from diffuse reflectance measurements. this method features a direct solution based on diffusion theory and an inversion procedure based on the levenberg-marquardt algorithm. we have validated our method through monte carlo simulations, experiments on tissue-like phantoms, and measurements on the forehead of three human subjects. the monte carlo simulations and phantom measurements have shown that, in ideal two-layered samples, our method accurately recovers the top layer thickness (l), the absorption coefficient (µa) and the reduced scattering coefficient (µ′s) of both layers with deviations that are typically less than 10% for all parameters. our method is aimed at absolute measurements of hemoglobin concentration and saturation in cerebral and extracerebral tissue of adult human subjects, where the top layer (layer 1) represents extracerebral tissue (scalp, skull, dura mater, subarachnoid space, etc.) and the bottom layer (layer 2) represents cerebral tissue. human subject measurements have shown a significantly greater total hemoglobin concentration in cerebral tissue (82±14 µm) with respect to extracerebral tissue (30±7 µm). by contrast, there was no significant difference between the hemoglobin saturation measured in cerebral tissue (56%±10%) and extracerebral tissue (62%±6%). to our knowledge, this is the first time that an inversion procedure in the frequency domain with six unknown parameters with no other prior knowledge is used for the retrieval of the optical coefficients and top layer thickness with high accuracy on two-layered media. our absolute measurements of cerebral hemoglobin concentration and saturation are based on the discrimination of extracerebral and cerebral tissue layers, and they can enhance the impact of nirs for cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation assessment both in the research arena and clinical practice. we present near-infrared spectroscopy measurement of absolute cerebral hemoglobin concentration and saturation in a large sample of 36 healthy elderly (mean age, 85 ± 6 years) and 19 young adults (mean age, 28 ± 4 years). non-invasive measurements were obtained on the forehead using a commercially available multi-distance frequency-domain system and analyzed using a diffusion theory model for a semi-infinite, homogeneous medium with semi-infinite boundary conditions. our study included repeat measurements, taken five months apart, on 16 elderly volunteers that demonstrate intra-subject reproducibility of the absolute measurements with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.9 for absorption coefficient (μa), oxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hbo2]), and total hemoglobin concentration ([hbt]), 0.7 for deoxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hb]), 0.8 for hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sto2), and 0.7 for reduced scattering coefficient (μ's). we found significant differences between the two age groups. compared to young subjects, elderly subjects had lower cerebral [hbo2], [hb], [hbt], and sto2 by 10 ± 4 μm, 4 ± 3 μm, 14 ± 5 μm, and 6%±5%, respectively. our results demonstrate the reliability and robustness of multi-distance near-infrared spectroscopy measurements based on a homogeneous model in the human forehead on a large sample of human subjects. absolute, non-invasive optical measurements on the brain, such as those presented here, can significantly advance the development of nirs technology as a tool for monitoring resting/basal cerebral perfusion, hemodynamics, oxygenation, and metabolism.
liver resection is the only curative treatment for patients with colorectal liver metastases (clms). neoadjuvant chemotherapy can improve resectability but has a potential harmful effect on the nontumorous liver. patients with chemotherapy-induced hepatic injury undergoing liver surgery have higher risks of post-resectional morbidity. we present two cases of patients without pre-existent liver disease treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of their clms. their intra-operative liver specimen showed morphologic abnormalities characteristic of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (nrh). nrh led to portal hypertension in both patients that resulted in deleterious post-resectional complications and death of one patient. interestingly, the other patient underwent two repeat nonanatomic liver resections because of recurrent clms. the intra-operative liver specimen still showed signs of nrh and sinusoidal congestion, but the post-resectional courses were uneventful. nevertheless, caution is recommended in patients with suspected nrh. careful volumetric analysis should guide the operative strategy. when future remnant liver volume is regarded insufficient, portal vein embolization or restrictive surgery should be considered. background in advanced metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma, the addition of a neo-adjuvant systemic treatment to surgery might translate into a survival advantage, although this is yet to be confirmed by ongoing randomized trials. the objective of this study was to assess the effects of preoperative systemic chemotherapy on the morphology of non-tumoral liver.   patients and methods a large series of surgically resected liver metastases (n=153) was selected. light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry using antibodies against endothelial cells (cd31) and hepatic stellate cells (alpha-sm actin, crbp-1) were performed to identify sinusoidal wall integrity.   results we found that 44 (51%) of the 87 post-chemotherapic liver resection specimens had sinusoidal dilatation and hemorrhage, related to rupture of the sinusoidal barrier. in contrast, the 66 livers treated by surgery alone remained normal. in 21 out of the 44 post-chemotherapy patients (48%), perisinusoidal and veno-occlusive fibrosis also developed. sinusoidal injury persisted several months after end of chemotherapy, and fibrosis may progress. development of lesions was strongly correlated to the use of oxaliplatin; 34 out of 43 patients (78%) treated with this drug showed striking sinusoidal alterations.   conclusions systemic neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer frequently causes morphological lesions involving hepatic microvasculature. sinusoidal obstruction, complicated by perisinusoidal fibrosis and veno-occlusive lesion of the non-tumoral liver revealed by this study, should be included in the list of the adverse side-effects of colorectal systemic chemotherapy, in particular related to the use of oxaliplatin.
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (enos) mrna and protein levels increase during late gestation and then decrease postnatally in sheep lung parenchyma. the increase in fluid shear stress at birth, resulting from increased pulmonary blood flow, is an important mediator of postnatal enos gene expression. our objective was to identify factors stimulating enos expression in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (paec) in response to shear stress and to determine if these factors are developmentally regulated. paec were isolated from fetal lambs and adult sheep. transcriptional activity from a 1,600-bp enos promoter fragment increased in both fetal and adult paec exposed to 8 h of shear stress. conversely, activity driven from an 840-bp promoter fragment containing a putative activator protein (ap)-1 binding site was increased only in fetal paec. this increase was completely abolished in an identical construct containing a mutant ap-1 sequence. the ap-1 protein c-jun was localized to the cytosol in static adult paec and to the nucleus in static fetal paec. after shear, c-jun was nuclear localized in both cell types. however, transcriptionally active phosphorylated c-jun was elevated only in the nuclei of sheared fetal paec. resting levels of enos and no were 2- and 20-fold higher, respectively, in fetal cells. shear increased enos and no in both cell types: levels were approximately 2.5-fold higher in fetal paec. phosphorylation of akt and enos was evident in sheared fetal but not adult paec. we have therefore identified mechanisms of enos regulation at the transcriptional level and to be enzyme activation specific to the fetal pulmonary arterial circulation. the ultraviolet (uv) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by ap-1 and nf-kappa b. the effect on ap-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-jun nh2-terminal activation domain. here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of jnk1, a distant relative of the map kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at thr and tyr during the uv response. significantly, ha-ras partially activates jnk1 and potentiates the activation caused by uv. jnk1 binds to the c-jun transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on ser-63 and ser-73. thus, jnk1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and uv irradiation. these properties indicate that jnk1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion.
abstract r.swai, a type iip restriction endonuclease, recognizes a palindromic eight base pair (bp) symmetric sequence, 5΄-atttaaat-3΄, and cleaves that target at its center to generate blunt-ended dna fragments. here, we report three crystal structures of swai: unbound enzyme, a dna-bound complex with calcium ions; and a dna-bound, fully cleaved complex with magnesium ions. we compare these structures to two structurally similar ‘pd-d/exk’ restriction endonucleases (ecorv and hincii) that also generate blunt-ended products, and to a structurally distinct enzyme (the hnh endonuclease paci) that also recognizes an 8-bp target site consisting solely of a:t base pairs. binding by swai induces an extreme bend in the target sequence accompanied by un-pairing and re-ordering of its central a:t base pairs. this result is reminiscent of a more dramatic target deformation previously described for paci, implying that long a:t-rich target sites might display structural or dynamic behaviors that play a significant role in endonuclease recognition and cleavage. transcription factors can be divided into classes on the basis of their mode of interaction with the target promoter sequence. different protein domains responsible for dna recognition have been identified. in this review we discuss the leucine zipper structure, which has been found in several nuclear factors, including the oncoproteins fos and jun. structural considerations are summarized to help understand how dimerization is mediated by the leucine zipper and how this is the prerequisite for optimal target dna recognition by the adjacent basic domains.
what is the significance of sperm in reproduction? recent studies have demonstrated surprising clues that have changed the answers to this question. in addition to providing half of the genome of a mammalian organism, sperm also contributes other molecules such as mrna, micrornas (mirna), proteins, and metabolites that are vitally important for fertility (feugang et al., 2009, 2010; peddinti et al., 2008). furthermore, molecular health of the sperm chromatin and dna quality also play major roles in sperm viability. put together, these recent advances have produced a wealth of new knowledge that can provide a systems biology point of view for fertility. these findings highlight the fact that changes in sperm dna and expressed gene products provide information on the effects of environment on development and disease. spermatozoa deliver more than the paternal genome into the oocyte; they also carry remnant messenger rna from spermatogenesis. the rna profiles of spermatozoa from high-fertility and a low-fertility holstein bulls were analysed using affymetrix bovine genechips. a total of 415 transcripts out of approximately 24,000 were differentially detected in spermatozoa collected from both bulls (fold change > or =2.0; p<0.01). these transcripts were associated with different cellular functions and biological processes. spermatozoa from high-fertility bulls contained higher concentrations of transcripts for membrane and extracellular space protein locations, while spermatozoa from the low-fertility bulls were deficient of transcripts for transcriptional and translational factors. quantitative real-time pcr was used on three low-fertility and four high-fertility bulls to validate the microarray data. two highly represented transcripts in the microarray analysis (protamine 1 and casein beta 2) were validated, as well as a third transcript (thrombospondin receptor cd36 molecule) that showed a lower concentration in low-fertility bulls. this study presents the global analysis of spermatozoa originating from bulls with opposite fertility. these results provide some specific transcripts in spermatozoa that could be associated with bull fertility.
we studied seven itokawa particles provided by the japan aerospace exploration agency (jaxa) as first international announcement of opportunity (ao) study mainly using electron and synchrotron radiation x-ray beam techniques. all the analyzed particles were collected from the first-touchdown site and composed of olivine and plagioclase with traces of ca phosphate and chromite, and do not contain pyroxenes. optical microscopy of these particles shows minor undulatory extinction of olivine and plagioclase, suggesting minor shock metamorphism (shock stage: s2). the electron microprobe analysis shows that olivine is fo70-73 and plagioclase is an13-10or5-7. the synchrotron radiation x-ray diffraction (sr-xrd) analysis of olivine crystals gives cell dimensions of a = 4.708 to 4.779 å, b = 10.271 to 10.289 å, c = 6.017 to 6.024 å, corresponding to the fo content of fo~70 by vegard's law. this composition matches the result obtained by the electron microprobe analysis. the olivine compositions of the analyzed particles are consistent with those of ll chondrites. the cell dimensions of two plagioclase crystals (a = 8.180 to 8.194 å, b = 12.53 to 12.893 å, c = 7.125 to 7.23 å, α = 92.6° to 93.00°, β = 116.36° to 116.75°, γ = 90.03° to 90.17°) indicate that their equilibration temperatures are 800°c ± 10°c. this temperature is near the peak metamorphic temperature recorded by equilibrated ordinary chondrites. the size of plagioclase crystals and the homogeneity of olivine compositions indicate that their petrologic type is ≥5. we also analyzed plagioclase by sr iron x-ray absorption near-edge structure (sr-xanes) and found that its fe3+/(fe2+ + fe3+) ratio is approximately 0.5. such high fe3+ abundance indicates the formation under a relatively oxidizing environment. thus, all these analyses have reconfirmed that the itokawa particles returned by the hayabusa spacecraft are very weakly shocked equilibrated ll chondrites, which matches the results of the preliminary examination team. laboratory analysis of samples returned from an asteroid establishes a direct link between asteroids and meteorites and provides clues to the complex history of the asteroid and its surface. meteorite studies suggest that each solar system object has a unique oxygen isotopic composition. chondrites, the most primitive of meteorites, have been believed to be derived from asteroids, but oxygen isotopic compositions of asteroids themselves have not been established. we measured, using secondary ion mass spectrometry, oxygen isotopic compositions of rock particles from asteroid 25143 itokawa returned by the hayabusa spacecraft. compositions of the particles are depleted in 16o relative to terrestrial materials and indicate that itokawa, an s-type asteroid, is one of the sources of the ll or l group of equilibrated ordinary chondrites. this is a direct oxygen-isotope link between chondrites and their parent asteroid.
introductionin animal models, lipid emulsion therapy has been shown to ameliorate toxicity from a number of lipid soluble agents. this preliminary study addresses the hypothesis that pretreatment with lipid emulsion protects against propranolol toxicity in rodents.methodsten spontaneously ventilating rattus norvegicus rats were pretreated with either lipid emulsion or 0.9% normal saline before undergoing a constant infusion of propranolol until death. an electrocardiogram (ecg) sampling of heart rate and a qrs duration was performed at two-minute intervals until demise.resultsthere was no significant difference in lethal doses of propranolol between groups. comparison of percent change in qrs prolongation and heart rate reduction was performed at 60% of the mean lethal dose in control animals. the percent change in qrs duration was reduced (from −0.9 to 17.3, p = 0.016) in the intralipid pretreatment group. attenuation of propranolol-induced bradycardia observed in the lipid emulsion group approached statistical significance (0% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.06).interpretationthe results suggest that lipid emulsion may be effective in ameliorating propranolol toxicity in rats. previous work gives reason to postulate a pharmacokinetic mechanism for this effect. the results represent encouraging exploratory work, and further work is planned to evaluate the role of lipid emulsion therapy in propranolol toxicity. amphotericin b (amb) remains the gold standard for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. however, the efficacy is limited, with response rates from 10% to 80%. moreover, amb is toxic, especially for the kidneys. new formulations have been developed in an attempt to improve both efficacy and tolerability. in an attempt to reduce toxicity, a number of investigators have reconstituted amb in a lipid emulsion, but few data are available on efficacy in documented infections. an improvement in immediate and renal tolerance was obtained with equivalent daily dose regimens, but the therapeutic index does not appear to be improved. this approach cannot be recommended at present. three lipid formulations have been developed and are now available in most countries: amb colloidal dispersion (abcd), amb lipid complex (ablc), and liposomal amb (ambisome). the efficacy of abcd on various fungal infections has been assessed in open trials, with a response rate of 49% in aspergillosis, 70% in candidiasis, and 67% in mucormycosis. in two randomized trials comparing abcd with amb in invasive aspergillosis and in persistent febrile neutropenia, the response rates were equivalent. abcd was less nephrotoxic. in contrast, immediate reactions to abcd were as frequent and severe as with amb. these immediate effects are more frequent during the first infusions and lessen as treatment continues. the recommended dose is 3–4 mg/kg/day. ablc appeared to be effective as rescue therapy in various types of invasive mycoses, with a response rate of 42% in aspergillosis, 67% in candidiasis, and 82% in fusariosis. efficacy identical to that of amb was demonstrated in a comparative randomized trial involving patients with invasive candidiasis. general and renal tolerability is improved compared with amb. the recommended dose regimen is 5 mg/kg/day. liposomal amb (ambisome) is the only truly liposomal formulation. the response rates in preliminary trials were 66% in aspergillosis and 81% in candidiasis. several comparative studies have confirmed that this formulation has similar or superior efficacy relative to amb in various fungal infections and also in the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. renal and general tolerability is excellent. the optimal dosing remains unclear but is generally between 3 and 5 mg/kg/day. a double‐blind trial comparing the tolerance of liposomal amb and ablc demonstrated that both infusion‐related events and nephrotoxicity were significantly lower for liposomal amb. in sum, the new lipid formulations of amb are effective in various invasive fungal infections. the three formulations exhibit reduced nephrotoxicity compared with conventional amb. large‐scale comparative clinical trials may clarify issues of relative efficacy in various forms of mycotic infections. note
adolescence is defined as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood characterized by changes in social interaction and acquisition of mature cognitive abilities. these changes have been associated with the maturation of brain regions involved in the control of motivation, emotion, and cognition. among these regions, the protracted development of the human prefrontal cortex during adolescence has been proposed to underlie the maturation of cognitive functions and the regulation of affective responses. studies in animal models allow us to test the causal contribution of specific neural processes in the development of the prefrontal cortex and the acquisition of adult behavior. this review summarizes the cellular and synaptic mechanisms occurring in the rodent prefrontal cortex during adolescence as a model for understanding the changes underlying human prefrontal development. the adolescent susceptibility to the onset of psychiatric disorders is only beginning to be understood when factoring in the development of the prefrontal cortex (pfc). the functional maturation of the pfc is dependent upon proper integration of glutamatergic inputs from the ventral hippocampus (vhipp) and the basolateral amygdala (bla). here we assessed how transient nmdar blockade during adolescence alters the functional interaction of vhipp–bla inputs in regulating pfc plasticity. local field potential recordings were used to determine changes in long-term depression (ltd) and long-term potentiation (ltp) of pfc responses resulting from vhipp and bla high-frequency stimulation in adult rats that received repeated injections of saline or the nmdar antagonist mk-801 from postnatal day 35 (p35) to p40. we found that early adolescent mk-801 exposure elicited an age- and input-specific dysregulation of vhipp–pfc plasticity, characterized by a shift from ltd to ltp without altering the bla-induced ltp. data also showed that the vhipp normally resets the ltp state of bla transmission; however, this inhibitory regulation is absent following early adolescent mk-801 treatment. this deficit was reminiscent of pfc responses seen in drug-naive juveniles. notably, local prefrontal upregulation of gabaaα1 function completely restored vhipp functionality and its regulation of bla plasticity in mk-801-treated rats. thus, nmdar signaling is critical for the periadolescent acquisition of a gaba-dependent hippocampal control of pfc plasticity, which enables the inhibitory control of the prefrontal output by the vhipp. a dysregulation of this pathway can alter pfc processing of other converging afferents such as those from the bla.
study findings have been inconsistent in confirming advantages for mobile-bearing compared with fixed-bearing prostheses for total knee arthroplasty. therefore, we did meta-analysis of trials comparing outcomes from using the 2 different designs. of 5670 citations identified for screening, 10 trials reporting 620 participants (906 knees) at final follow-up were eligible for data extraction and meta-analysis. the meta-analysis did not find a significant difference in the american knee society knee scores, knee society functional and pain scores, range of motion, occurrence of radiolucent lines, prosthesis-related complications, and participant preference. the results suggest that the mobile-bearing prosthesis does not offer clinical or radiologic advantage over the fixed-bearing prosthesis. this paper examines eight published reviews each reporting results from several related trials. each review pools the results from the relevant trials in order to evaluate the efficacy of a certain treatment for a specified medical condition. these reviews lack consistent assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect before pooling. we discuss a random effects approach to combining evidence from a series of experiments comparing two treatments. this approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. the model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations. we suggest a simple noniterative procedure for characterizing the distribution of treatment effects in a series of studies.
an approach for the integration of supervising information into unsupervised clustering is presented (semi supervised learning). the underlying unsupervised clustering algorithm is based on swarm technologies from the field of artificial life systems. its basic elements are autonomous agents called databots. their unsupervised movement patterns correspond to structural features of a high dimensional data set. supervising information can be easily incorporated in such a system through the implementation of special movement strategies. these strategies realize given constraints or cluster information. the system has been tested on fundamental clustering problems. it outperforms constrained k-means. semi-supervised clustering employs a small amount of labeled data to aid unsupervised learning. previous work in the area has utilized supervised data in one of two approaches: 1) constraint-based methods that guide the clustering algorithm towards a better grouping of the data, and 2) distance-function learning methods that adapt the underlying similarity metric used by the clustering algorithm. this paper provides new methods for the two approaches as well as presents a new semi-supervised clustering algorithm that integrates both of these techniques in a uniform, principled framework. experimental results demonstrate that the unified approach produces better clusters than both individual approaches as well as previously proposed semi-supervised clustering algorithms.
bacteria, including pathogenic strains, need to make use of the metal composition and speciation of their environment to fulfill the requirement of the cytoplasmic metal content and composition. this task is performed by the bacterial metal transportome, composed of uptake and efflux systems. seven interacting secondary metal uptake systems are at the core of the metal transportome in c. metallidurans. this publication verifies that posttranscriptional events are responsible for activation of even more, yet-unknown, metal import systems in the 7-fold deletion mutant δ7. two p-type atpases were identified as new members of the metal uptake transportome. this publication demonstrates the complexity of the metal transportome and the regulatory processes involved. abstract central to the ability of cupriavidus metallidurans to maintain its metal homoeostasis is the metal transportome, composed of uptake and efflux systems. seven secondary metal import systems, zupt, pita, cora1, cora2, cora3, zntb, and hoxn, interact and are at the core of the metal uptake transportome. the 7-fold deletion mutant δ7 (δzupt δpita δcora1δcora2δcora3δzntb δhoxn) of parent strain ae104 is still able to maintain its cellular metal content, although at the cost of reduced fitness (m. herzberg, l. bauer, a. kirsten, and d. h. nies, metallomics, in press, http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5mt00295h ). strain δ7 does not express genes for backup importers, and so δ7 should use metal uptake systems also produced in the ae104 parent cells. these systems should be activated in δ7 by posttranscriptional regulatory processes. the decreased fitness of δ7 correlated with a zinc-dependent downregulation of the overall metabolic backbone of the cells even at nontoxic external zinc concentrations. responsible for this decreased fitness of δ7 was a negative interference of the activity of two p-type atpases, mgta and mgtb, which, on the other hand, kept δ7 at a fitness level higher than that of the δ9 (δ7 δmgta::kan δmgtb) mutant strain. this revealed a complicated interplay of the metal uptake transportome of c. metallidurans, which is composed of the seven secondary uptake systems, mgta, mgtb, and yet-unknown components, with cytoplasmic transition metal pools and posttranscriptional regulatory processes. importance bacteria, including pathogenic strains, need to make use of the metal composition and speciation of their environment to fulfill the requirement of the cytoplasmic metal content and composition. this task is performed by the bacterial metal transportome, composed of uptake and efflux systems. seven interacting secondary metal uptake systems are at the core of the metal transportome in c. metallidurans. this publication verifies that posttranscriptional events are responsible for activation of even more, yet-unknown, metal import systems in the 7-fold deletion mutant δ7. two p-type atpases were identified as new members of the metal uptake transportome. this publication demonstrates the complexity of the metal transportome and the regulatory processes involved. cupriavidus metallidurans ch34 possesses a multitude of metal efflux systems. here, the function of the novel pib4‐type atpase czcp is characterized, which belongs to the plasmid pmol30‐mediated cobalt‐zinc‐cadmium (czc) resistance system. contribution of czcp to transition metal resistance in c. metallidurans was compared with that of three pib2‐type atpases (cada, znta, prba) and to other efflux proteins by construction and characterization of multiple deletion mutants. these data also yielded additional evidence for an export of metal cations from the periplasm to the outside of the cell rather than from the cytoplasm to the outside. moreover, metal‐sensitive escherichia coli strains were functionally substituted in trans with czcp and the three pib2‐type atpases. metal transport kinetics performed with inside‐out vesicles identified the main substrates for these four exporters, the km values and apparent turn‐over numbers. in combination with the mutant data, transport kinetics indicated that czcp functions as ‘resistance enhancer’: this pib4‐type atpase exports transition metals zn2+, cd2+ and co2+ much more rapidly than the three pib2‐type proteins. however, a basic resistance level has to be provided by the pib2‐type efflux pumps because czcp may not be able to reach all different speciations of these metals in the cytoplasm.
amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) is a principal metabolic regulator affecting growth and response to cellular stress. comprised of catalytic and regulatory subunits, each present in multiple forms, ampk is best described as a family of related enzymes. in recent years, ampk has emerged as a desirable target for modulation of numerous diseases, yet clinical therapies remain elusive. challenges result, in part, from an incomplete understanding of the structure and function of full-length heterotrimeric complexes. in this work, we provide the full-length structure of the widely expressed α1β1γ1 isoform of mammalian ampk, along with detailed kinetic and biophysical characterization. we characterize binding of the broadly studied synthetic activator a769662 and its analogs. our studies follow on the heels of the recent disclosure of the α2β1γ1 structure and provide insight into the distinct molecular mechanisms of ampk regulation by amp and a769662. amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) plays a major role in regulating cellular energy balance by sensing and responding to increases in amp/adp concentration relative to atp. binding of amp causes allosteric activation of the enzyme and binding of either amp or adp promotes and maintains the phosphorylation of threonine 172 within the activation loop of the kinase. ampk has attracted widespread interest as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes and, more recently, cancer. a number of direct ampk activators have been reported as having beneficial effects in treating metabolic diseases, but there has been no structural basis for activator binding to ampk. here we present the crystal structure of human ampk in complex with a small molecule activator that binds at a site between the kinase domain and the carbohydrate-binding module, stabilising the interaction between these two components. the nature of the activator-binding pocket suggests the involvement of an additional, as yet unidentified, metabolite in the physiological regulation of ampk. importantly, the structure offers new opportunities for the design of small molecule activators of ampk for treatment of metabolic disorders.
backgrounddespite low rates of obesity, many university students perceive themselves as overweight, especially women. this is of concern, because inappropriate weight perceptions can lead to unhealthy behaviours including eating disorders.methodswe used the database from the cross national student health survey (cnshs), consisting of 5,900 records of university students from bulgaria, denmark, germany, lithuania, poland, spain and turkey to analyse differences in perceived weight status based on the question: "do you consider yourself much too thin, a little too thin, just right, a little too fat or much too fat?". the association between perceived weight and body mass index (bmi) calculated from self-reported weight and height was assessed with generalized non-parametric regression in r library gam.resultsalthough the majority of students reported a normal bmi (72-84% of males, 65-83% of females), only 32% to 68% of students considered their weight "just right". around 20% of females with bmi of 20 kg/m2 considered themselves "a little too fat" or "too fat", and the percentages increased to 60% for a bmi of 22.5 kg/m2. male students rarely felt "a little too fat" or "too fat" below bmi of 22.5 kg/m2, but most felt too thin with a bmi of 20 kg/m2.conclusionsweight ideals are rather uniform across the european countries, with female students being more likely to perceive themselves as "too fat" at a normal bmi, while male students being more likely to perceive themselves as "too thin". programs to prevent unhealthy behaviours to achieve ill-advised weight ideals may benefit students. objectives: to assess eating habits and some food related behaviours, beliefs and knowledge in educated young french adults.design: a standardized questionnaire administered in university classes.setting: university or ‘grandes ecoles’ of paris and dijon.subjects: 660 male and female french students.interventions: international survey; questionnaire composed of three major sections: (1) health-related attitudes such as substances used, dieting, health practices; (2) beliefs concerning behaviour and health, including eating habits; (3) knowledge, namely relevance of factors to diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular diseases.results: gender, self-perception of body size, bmi and attempts to lose weight affected a number of behaviours. average bmi corresponded to standard values. ’healthy’ behaviours were often reported such as: avoiding fat and cholesterol, efforts to eat fruit and fiber. the french students showed a low frequency of snacking and a high regularity in having breakfast, especially respondents with lower bmi (females ≤23 and males ≤24.5 kg/m2). beliefs about the importance of behaviours were closely associated with the performance of the behaviours. awareness of the role of eating factors in cardiovascular diseases was observed.conclusion: the meal and snack pattern in french students is very close to the traditional model. more food- and health-related behaviours and attitudes are reported by women than men. some of them could be due to a genuine motivation for prevention and health in females or else to a greater wish to be thin. ‘desire to lose weight’ is often reported although bmi values are normally low in this young population. beliefs in the importance of a behaviour for health are correlated with the reported performance of the behaviours.sponsorship: data entry was supported in part through the commission of the european communities, medical and health research programme, concerted action on breakdown in human adaptation: quantification of parameters.
central vestibular neurons form identifiable subgroups within the boundaries of classically outlined octavolateral nuclei in primitive vertebrates that are distinct from those processing lateral line, electrosensory, and auditory signals. each vestibular subgroup exhibits a particular morpho-physiological property that receives origin-specific sensory inputs from semicircular canal and otolith organs. behaviorally characterized phenotypes send discrete axonal projections to extraocular, spinal, and cerebellar targets including other ipsi- and contralateral vestibular nuclei. the anatomical locations of vestibuloocular and vestibulospinal neurons correlate with genetically defined hindbrain compartments that are well conserved throughout vertebrate evolution though some variability exists in fossil and extant vertebrate species. the different vestibular subgroups exhibit a robust sensorimotor signal processing complemented with a high degree of vestibular and visual adaptive plasticity. the development and evolution of the inner ear sensory patches and their innervation is reviewed. recent molecular developmental data suggest that development of these sensory patches is a developmental recapitulation of the evolutionary history. these data suggest that the ear generates multiple, functionally diverse sensory epithelia by dividing a single sensory primordium. those epithelia will establish distinct identities through the overlapping expression of genes of which only a few are currently known. one of these distinctions is the unique pattern of hair cell polarity. a hypothesis is presented on how the hair cell polarity may relate to the progressive segregation of the six sensory epithelia. besides being markers for sensory epithelia development, neurotrophins are also expressed in delaminating cells that migrate toward the developing vestibular and cochlear ganglia. these delaminating cells originate from multiple sites at or near the developing sensory epithelia and some also express neuronal markers such as neurod. the differential origin of precursors raises the possibility that some sensory neurons acquire positional information before they delaminate the ear. such an identity of these delaminating sensory neurons may be used both to navigate their dendrites to the area they delaminated from, as well as to help them navigate to their central target. the navigational properties of sensory neurons as well as the acquisition of discrete sensory patch phenotypes implies a much more sophisticated subdivision of the developing otocyst than the few available gene expression studies suggest.
chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massive parallel sequencing (chip-seq) is a powerful technology to identify the genome-wide locations of dna binding proteins such as transcription factors or modified histones. as more and more experimental laboratories are adopting chip-seq to unravel the transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, computational analyses of chip-seq also become increasingly comprehensive and sophisticated. in this article, we review current computational methodology for chip-seq analysis, recommend useful algorithms and workflows, and introduce quality control measures at different analytical steps. we also discuss how chip-seq could be integrated with other types of genomic assays, such as gene expression profiling and genome-wide association studies, to provide a more comprehensive view of gene regulatory mechanisms in important physiological and pathological processes. recent progress in massively parallel sequencing platforms has enabled genome-wide characterization of dna-associated proteins using the combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (chip-seq). although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative chip microarray (chip-chip), few approaches have been described for processing chip-seq data. to fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. we compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. we also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.
somatic hypermutation (shm) of ig genes depends upon the deamination of c nucleotides in wrcy (w = a/t, r = a/g, y = c/t) motifs by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (aicda). despite this, a large number of mutations occur in wa motifs that can be accounted for by the activity of polymerase η (pol η). to determine whether there are aicda-independent mutations and to characterize the relationship between aicda- and pol η-mediated mutations, 1470 h chain and 1313 κ- and λ-chain rearrangements from three aicda−/− patients were analyzed. the ig mutation frequency of all vh genes from aicda−/− patients was 40-fold less than that of normal donors, whereas the mutation frequency of mutated vh sequences from aicda−/− patients was 6.8-fold less than that of normal donors. aicda−/− b cells lack mutations in wrcy/rgyw motifs as well as replacement mutations and mutational targeting in complementarity-determining regions. a significantly reduced mutation frequency in wa motifs compared with normal donors and an increased percentage of transitions, which may relate to reduced uracil dna-glycosylase activity, suggest a role for aicda in regulating pol η and uracil dna-glycosylase activity. similar results were observed in vl rearrangements. the residual mutations were predominantly g:c substitutions, indicating that aicda-independent cytidine deamination was a likely, yet inefficient, mechanism for mutating ig genes. the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (aid) gene, specifically expressed in germinal center b cells in mice, is a member of the cytidine deaminase family. we herein report mutations in the human counterpart of aid in patients with the autosomal recessive form of hyper-igm syndrome (higm2). three major abnormalities characterize aid deficiency: (1) the absence of immunoglobulin class switch recombination, (2) the lack of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutations, and (3) lymph node hyperplasia caused by the presence of giant germinal centers. the phenotype observed in higm2 patients (and in aid-/- mice) demonstrates the absolute requirement for aid in several crucial steps of b cell terminal differentiation necessary for efficient antibody responses.
the early signaling mechanism of sphingosine 1-phosphate (s1p) on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) activation was investigated in c6 glioma cells. s1p activated the enzyme in association with a shift in the mobility on electrophoresis reflecting phosphorylation of both erk1/erk2 at as low as 10 nm. the lipid-induced erk1/2 activation was partially inhibited by treatment of the cells with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (a long-term treatment to desensitize protein kinase c) or pertussis toxin (ptx) and was completely inhibited by a simultaneous treatment with both agents. similarly, either calphostin c, an inhibitor of protein kinase c, or u73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase c, partially inhibited the s1pinduced erk1/2 activation in the nontreated cells with ptx and completely in the toxin-treated cells. on the other hand, the s1p-induced erk activation was hardly affected by ethanol, which switched the product of phospholipase d from phosphatidic acid to metabolism-resistant phosphatidylethanol. s1p was able to activate erk1/2 without a detectable increase in the intracellular content of the lipid, but sphingosine, a substrate of sphingosine kinase, which is an enzyme for s1p generation in the cells, hardly affected the erk1/2 activation in spite of a marked elevation of intracellular s1p accumulation. this indicates that intracellular increase in s1p is not necessary for the s1p-induced erk activation, and hence suggests the extracellular action mechanism of s1p. supporting this idea, mrnas of recently identified s1p specific receptors, edg-1 and agr16/h218, were expressed in c6 cells. taken together, these results suggested that s1p acts on c6 cells extracellularly possibly through s1p receptors which are linked to at least two signaling pathways, i.e., the ptx-sensitive gi/go protein pathway and the toxin-insensitive gq/g11-phospholipase c-pkc pathway, resulting in the activation of erk. we previously showed that sphingosine 1‐phosphate (spp) acts as a second messenger for tumor necrosis factor α‐induced interleukin‐6 (il‐6) synthesis in osteoblast‐like mc3t3‐e1 cells. in the present study, we further investigated the mechanism of il‐6 synthesis induced by spp in mc3t3‐e1 cells. spp significantly induced p42/p44 mitogen‐activated protein (map) kinase activity. pd98059, an inhibitor of map kinase kinase, suppressed spp‐induced il‐6 synthesis as well as spp‐induced map kinase activation. the patterns of both inhibitions were similar. tmb‐8, an inhibitor of ca2+ mobilization from intracellular ca2+ stores, significantly suppressed the spp‐induced il‐6 synthesis. these results strongly suggest that spp‐induced il‐6 synthesis is mediated via p42/p44 map kinase activation in osteoblast‐like cells and that the spp‐induced il‐6 synthesis is dependent on intracellular ca2+ mobilization.
both the ercc1-xpf complex and the proteins involved in homoiogous recombination (hr) have critical roles in inter-strand cross-link (icl) repair. here, we report that mitomycin c-induced lesions inhibit replication fork elongation. furthermore, mitomycin c-induced dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) are the result of the collapse of icl-stalled replication forks. these are not formed through replication run off, as we show that mitomycin c or cisplatin-induced dna lesions are not incised by global genome nucleotide excision repair (ggr). we also suggest that icl-lesion repair is initiated either by replication or transcription, as the ggr does not incise icl-lesions. furthermore, we report that rad51 foci are induced by cisplatin or mitomycin c independently of ercc1, but that mitomycin c-induced hr measured in a reporter construct is impaired in ercc1-defective cells. these data suggest that ercc1–xpf plays a role in completion of hr in icl repair. we also find no additional sensitivity to cisplatin by sirna co-depletion of xrcc3 and ercc1, showing that the two proteins act on the same pathway to promote survival. abstract interstrand cross-links (icls) make up a unique class of dna lesions in which both strands of the double helix are covalently joined, precluding strand opening during replication and transcription. the repair of dna icls has become a focus of study since icls are recognized as the main cytotoxic lesion inflicted by an array of alkylating compounds used in cancer treatment. as is the case for double-strand breaks, a damage-free homologous copy is essential for the removal of icls in an error-free manner. however, recombination-independent mechanisms may exist to remove icls in an error-prone fashion. we have developed an in vivo reactivation assay that can be used to examine the removal of site-specific mitomycin c-mediated icls in mammalian cells. we found that the removal of the icl from the reporter substrate could take place in the absence of undamaged homologous sequences in repair-proficient cells, suggesting a cross-link repair mechanism that is independent of homologous recombination. systematic analysis of nucleotide excision repair mutants demonstrated the involvement of transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair and a partial requirement for the lesion bypass dna polymerase η encoded by the human polh gene. from these observations, we propose the existence of a recombination-independent and mutagenic repair pathway for the removal of icls in mammalian cells.
in between-hand choice reaction time tasks, the motor cortex involved in the required response (contralateral) has been shown to be activated while the motor cortex involved in the non-required response (ipsilateral) has been shown to be inhibited. the aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that ipsilateral inhibition reflects an active mechanism aimed at preventing errors. to this end, the risk of committing errors in between-hand choice reaction time tasks was manipulated by introducing a response probability bias. the surface laplacian transforms of electroencephalographic waves recorded over the motor cortices, contralateral and ipsilateral to the responding hand were compared. results showed that contralateral activation was not modulated by the risk of committing errors while ipsilateral inhibition was sensitive to this risk in a gradual manner: the higher the risk, the stronger the inhibition. the nogo potentials (n2/p3) were studied in a precuing auditory reaction time task in human subjects who had to either perform a button-press response (press condition) or imagine they were performing it (imagine condition). in the full precue condition (the subjects knew in advance which response they had to perform/imagine), in 25% of the trials, a nogo signal instructed the subject not to perform or not to imagine the prepared action. clear n2/p3 components were obtained on nogo trials on the press trials, but also on the imagine ones: the n2 was of similar amplitude in both conditions, whereas the p3 was of smaller amplitude in the imagine condition. the presence of nogo potential in motor imagery is discussed in terms of the functional significance of the n2/p3 complex.
to evaluate the prognostic value of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (flair) signal intensity of postoperative cavity on progression free survival (pfs) and overall survival (os) in patients with high-grade gliomas (hgg). this study retrospectively enrolled 45 consecutive hgg patients. these patients had chemoradiotherapy after gross-total resection of tumors. quantitative analysis of the flair signal intensity in postoperative cavity and background was made. we evaluated the threshold value, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and survival state with this technique. the patients who progressed and patients who did not progress were 33 and 12 cases separately. the ratio of postoperative cavity and background (c–b) on flair sequence in patients who progressed was higher than that of patients who did not progress (p = 0.014). the pfs of the patients who progressed was shorter than that of patients who did not progress (p = 0.008). the area under roc curve, threshold, sensitivity, specificity of c–b ratio for predicting tumor progression were 0.875, 62.3, 69.7, 0.84, and 0.50% respectively. the pfs of lower signal group was much longer than that of higher signal group (p = 0.004). the os of the patients with higher signal was shorter than that of patients with lower signal (p = 0.034). the increase of gray value of flair in postoperative cavity may be used as an imaging marker for predicting tumor progression. objective to determine if hyperintense fluid in the postsurgical cavity on follow-up fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (flair) sequences can predict progression in gliomas.   material and methods observational study of magnetic resonance imaging signal of fluid within the post-surgical cavity in patients with glioma (grade ii-iv), with surgery and follow-up between 2007 and 2012. qualitative comparison between the signal of fluid in the cavity and of the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was performed on flair sequences. fluid in the cavity was classified as isointense or hyperintense compared to csf. double-blind reading was performed. the signal intensity was correlated with tumour progression, assessed using response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria.   results a total of 107 patients were included, of whom 90 had high-grade gliomas. inter-rater agreement was excellent, and intra-rater complete (k=0.94 and 1, p<.001). hyperintense fluid in the resection cavity occurred more commonly (58.9% versus 29.4%, p=.025) and earlier (mean 4.5 versus 9.9 months, p<.001) in high-grade than in low-grade gliomas. hyperintense fluid was associated with progression in high-grade gliomas, with a sensitivity of 65.7% (95%ci, 54.3-75.6%) and a specificity of 70.6% (95%ci, 46.6-87%), and in low-grade gliomas with a sensitivity of 50% (95%ci, 18.7-81.2%), and a specificity of 81.8% (95%ci, 51.1-96%). the positive predictive value of this sign was 90.6% (95%ci, 79.3-96.3%) for high-grade gliomas, and was higher for grade iv (93.2%, 95%ci, 87.3-99.1%) and lower for grade iii (77.8%, 95%ci, 59.6-96%), and low-grade gliomas (60%, 95%ci, 22.9-88.4%). false-positives were identified in 7 patients, due to bleeding or infection. hyperintense fluid in high-grade gliomas preceded progression in 22 patients (30.1%), with a mean of 4.1 months (sd 2.1, 95% ci, 3.2-5), and associated with poorer progression-free survival (mean 6.8 versus 11.7 months, p=.004).   conclusions hyperintense fluid in the resection cavity on follow-up flair sequences occurs more frequently and earlier in high-grade gliomas, and is associated with poorer progression-free survival. hyperintense fluid is associated with disease progression, and can predict the progression of resected gliomas. false-positives due to bleeding and infection can be observed, and are easily recognizable.
heavy metal pollution of agricultural soils is one of the most severe ecological problems in the world. prosopis juliflora, a phreatophytic tree species, grows well in heavy metal laden industrial sites and is known to accumulate heavy metals. heavy metal atpases (hmas) are atp driven heavy metal pumps that translocate heavy metals across biological membranes thus helping the plant in heavy metal tolerance and phytoremediation. in the present study we have isolated and characterized a novel 28.9 kda heavy metal atpase peptide (pjhmt) from p. juliflora which shows high similarity to the c-terminal region of p1b atpase hma1. it also shows the absence of the invariant signature sequence dktgt, and the metal binding cpx motif but the presence of conserved regions like mvgegindapal (atp binding consensus sequence), heggtllvclns (metal binding domain) and mltgd, gegind and hegg motifs which play important roles in metal transport or atp binding. pjhmt, was found to be upregulated under cadmium and zinc stress. heterologous expression of pjhmt in yeast showed a higher accumulation and tolerance of heavy metals in yeast. further, transgenic tobacco plants constitutively expressing pjhmt also showed increased accumulation and tolerance to cadmium. thus, this study suggests that the transport peptide from p. juliflora may have an important role in cd uptake and thus in phytoremediation. athma1 is a member of the heavy metal-transporting atpase family. it exhibits amino acid sequence similarity to two other zn(ii) transporters, athma2 and athma4, and contains poly-his motifs that are commonly found in zn(ii)-binding proteins, but lacks some amino acids that are typical for this class of transporters. athma1 localizes to the chloroplast envelope. in comparison with wild-type plants, we observed a more pronounced sensitivity in the presence of high zn(ii) concentrations, and increased accumulation of zn in the chloroplast of t-dna insertional mutants in athma1. the zn(ii)-sensitive phenotype of athma1 knock-out plants was complemented by the expression of athma1 under the control of its own promoter. the zn(ii)-transporting activity of athma1 was confirmed in a heterologous expression system, saccharomyces cerevisiae. the sensitivity of yeast to high concentrations of zn(ii) was altered by the expression of athma1 lacking its n-terminal chloroplast-targeting signal. taken together, these results suggest that under conditions of excess zn(ii), athma1 contributes to zn(ii) detoxification by reducing the zn content of arabidopsis thaliana plastids.
auxin-binding protein 1 (abp1) is not easily accessible for molecular studies because the homozygous t-dna insertion mutant is embryo-lethal. we found that the heterozygous abp1/abp1 insertion mutant has defects in auxin physiology-related responses: higher root slanting angles, longer hypocotyls, agravitropic roots and hypocotyls, aphototropic hypocotyls, and decreased apical dominance. heterozygous plants flowered earlier than wild-type plants under short-day conditions. the length of the main root, the lateral root density and the hypocotyl length were little altered in the mutant in response to auxin. compared to wild-type plants, transcription of early auxin-regulated genes (iaa2, iaa11, iaa13, iaa14, iaa19, iaa20, saur9, saur15, saur23, gh3.5 and abp1) was less strongly up-regulated in the mutant by 0.1, 1 and 10 μm iaa. surprisingly, abp1 was itself an early auxin-up-regulated gene. iaa uptake into the mutant seedlings during auxin treatments was indistinguishable from wild-type. basipetal auxin transport in young roots was slower in the mutant, indicating a pin2/eir1 defect, while acropetal transport was indistinguishable from wild-type. in the eir1 background, three of the early auxin-regulated genes tested (iaa2, iaa13 and abp1) were more strongly induced by 1 μm iaa in comparison to wild-type, but eight of them were less up-regulated in comparison to wild-type. similar but not identical disturbances in regulation of early auxin-regulated genes indicate tight functional linkage of abp1 and auxin transport regulation. we hypothesize that abp1 is involved in the regulation of polar auxin transport, and thus affects local auxin concentration and early auxin gene regulation. in turn, abp1 itself is under the transcriptional control of auxin. summarywhen low concentrations (e.g. 10-6 m) of labelled 3-indoleacetic acid (14c-iaa) or α-naphthaleneacetic acid (14c-naa) are added in vitro to homogenates of corn coleoptiles, radioactivity is reversibly bound to pelletable particles. from the saturation kinetics of the binding it is possible to estimate an apparent km between 10-6 m and 10-5 m and a concentration of specific sites of 10-7–10-6 m per tissue volume.the binding is auxin-specific. among many compounds tested, only auxins and such auxin analogues that are known to interact directly with auxin in transport and/or growth were found to interfere with this binding. for instance, the growth-active d-dichlorophenoxyisopropionic acid at 10-4 m inhibits 14c-naa binding more than the less active l-isomer.the auxin-binding fractions are practically free of dna and cytochrome-c oxidase and contain binding sites for 1-naphthylphthalamic acid. the results are discussed in context with the hyothesis—derived mainly from physiological data—that auxin receptors are localized at the plasma membrane.
depending on its cellular localization, p120 catenin (p120ctn) can participate in various processes, such as cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion, actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and intracellular trafficking. recent studies also indicate that p120ctn could regulate cell proliferation and contact inhibition. this report describes a new function of p120ctn in the regulation of cell cycle progression. overexpression of the p120ctn isoform 3a in human colon adenocarcinoma cells (ht-29) results in cytoplasmic accumulation of the protein, as observed in many tumors. this cytoplasmic increase is correlated with a reduction in proliferation and inhibition of dna synthesis. under these conditions, experiments on synchronized cells revealed a prolonged s phase associated with cyclin e stabilization. both confocal microscopy and biochemical analysis showed that cyclin e and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 colocalized with p120ctn in centrosomes during mitosis. these proteins are associated in a functional complex evidenced by coimmunoprecipitation experiments and the emergence of thr199-phosphorylated nucleophosmin/b23. such post-translational modification of this centrosomal target has been shown to trigger the initiation of centrosome duplication. therefore, p120ctn-mediated accumulation of cyclin e in centrosomes may participate in abnormal amplification of centrosomes and the inhibition of dna replication, thus leading to aberrant mitosis and polyploidy. because these modifications are often observed in cancer, p120ctn may represent a new therapeutic target for future therapy. the abnormally high number of centrosomes found in many human tumor cells can lead directly to aneuploidy and genomic instability through the formation of multipolar mitotic spindles. to facilitate investigation of the mechanisms that control centrosome reproduction, a frog egg extract arrested in s phase of the cell cycle that supported repeated assembly of daughter centrosomes was developed. multiple rounds of centrosome reproduction were blocked by selective inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2-cyclin e (cdk2-e) and were restored by addition of purified cdk2-e. confocal immunomicroscopy revealed that cyclin e was localized at the centrosome. these results demonstrate that cdk2-e activity is required for centrosome duplication during s phase and suggest a mechanism that could coordinate centrosome reproduction with cycles of dna synthesis and mitosis.
a long-standing goal of ai and natural language processing (nlp) is to harness human knowledge by automatically understanding text. known as machine reading, it has become increasingly urgent with the rise of billions of web documents. however, progress in machine reading has been difficult, due to the combination of several key challenges: the complexity and uncertainty in representing and reasoning with knowledge, and the prohibitive cost in providing direct supervision (e.g., designing the meaning representation and labeling examples) for training a machine reading system.  in this dissertation, i propose a unifying approach for machine reading based on markov logic. markov logic defines a probabilistic model by weighted first-order logical formulas. it provides an ideal language for representing and reasoning with complex, probabilistic knowledge, and opens up new avenues for leveraging indirect supervision via joint inference, where the labels of some objects can be used to predict the labels of others.  i will demonstrate the promise of this approach by presenting a series of works that applied markov logic to increasingly challenging problems in machine reading. first, i will describe a joint approach for citation information extraction that combines information among different citations and processing stages. using markov logic as a representation language and the generic learning and inference algorithms available for it, our solution largely reduced to writing appropriate logical formulas and was able to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially less engineering effort compared to previous approaches.  next, i will describe an unsupervised coreference resolution system that builds on markov logic to incorporate prior knowledge and conduct large-scale joint inference. this helps compensate for the lack of labeled examples, and our unsupervised system often ties or even outperforms previous state-of-the-art supervised systems.  finally, i will describe the usp system, the first unsupervised approach for jointly inducing a meaning representation and extracting detailed meanings from text. to resolve linguistic variations for the same meaning, usp recursively clusters expressions that are composed with or by similar expressions. usp can also induce ontological relations by creating abstractions to assimilate commonalities among non-synonymous meaning clusters. this results in a state-of-the-art end-to-end machine reading system that can read text, extract knowledge and answer questions, all without any labeled examples. markov logic provides an extremely compact representation of the usp model, and enables future work to "close the loop" by incorporating the extracted knowledge into the model to aid further extraction. this note describes a scoring scheme for the coreference task in muc6. it improves on the original approach by: (1) grounding the scoring scheme in terms of a model; (2) producing more intuitive recall and precision scores; and (3) not requiring explicit computation of the transitive closure of coreference. the principal conceptual difference is that we have moved from a syntactic scoring model based on following coreference links to an approach defined by the model theory of those links.
background the visceral (vat) and subcutaneous (scat) adipose tissues play different roles in physiology and obesity. the molecular mechanisms underlying their expansion in obesity and following body weight reduction are poorly defined. methodology c57bl/6 mice fed a high fat diet (hfd) for 6 months developed low, medium, or high body weight as compared to normal chow fed mice. mice from each groups were then treated with the cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist rimonabant or vehicle for 24 days to normalize their body weight. transcriptomic data for visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues from each group of mice were obtained and analyzed to identify: i) genes regulated by hfd irrespective of body weight, ii) genes whose expression correlated with body weight, iii) the biological processes activated in each tissue using gene set enrichment analysis (gsea), iv) the transcriptional programs affected by rimonabant. principal findings in vat, “metabolic” genes encoding enzymes for lipid and steroid biosynthesis and glucose catabolism were down-regulated irrespective of body weight whereas “structure” genes controlling cell architecture and tissue remodeling had expression levels correlated with body weight. in scat, the identified “metabolic” and “structure” genes were mostly different from those identified in vat and were regulated irrespective of body weight. gsea indicated active adipogenesis in both tissues but a more prominent involvement of tissue stroma in vat than in scat. rimonabant treatment normalized most gene expression but further reduced oxidative phosphorylation gene expression in scat but not in vat. conclusion vat and scat show strikingly different gene expression programs in response to high fat diet and rimonabant treatment. our results may lead to identification of therapeutic targets acting on specific fat depots to control obesity. aim/hypothesisthe distinct metabolic properties of visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes may be due to inherent characteristics of the cells that are resident in each fat depot. to test this hypothesis, human adipocytes were differentiated in vitro from precursor stromal cells obtained from visceral and subcutaneous fat depots and analysed for genetic, biochemical and metabolic endpoints.methodsstromal cells were isolated from adipose tissue depots of nondiabetic individuals. mrna levels of adipocyte-specific proteins were determined by real-time rt-pcr. insulin signalling was evaluated by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. glucose transport was measured by a 2-deoxy-glucose uptake assay. adiponectin secretion in the adipocyte-conditioned medium was determined by a specific ria.resultswith cell differentiation, mrna levels of pparg, c/ebpα (also known as cebpa), ap2 (also known as gtf3a), glut4 (also known as slc2a4) were markedly upregulated, whereas glut1 (also known as slc2a1) mrna did not change. however, expression of c/ebpα, ap2 and adiponectin was higher in subcutaneous than in visceral adipocytes. by contrast, adiponectin was secreted at threefold higher rates by visceral than by subcutaneous adipocytes while visceral adipocytes also showed two- to threefold higher insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. insulin-induced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, irs proteins, akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 was more rapid and tended to decrease at earlier time-points in visceral than in subcutaneous adipocytes.conclusions/interpretationsubcutaneous and visceral adipocytes, also when differentiated in vitro from precursor stromal cells, retain differences in gene expression, adiponectin secretion, and insulin action and signalling. thus, the precursor cells that reside in the visceral and subcutaneous fat depots may already possess inherent and specific metabolic characteristics that will be expressed upon completion of the differentiation programme.
we address a fundamental question concerning spatio-temporal database systems: “what are exactly spatio-temporal queries?” we define spatio-temporal queries to be computable mappings that are also generic, meaning that the result of a query may only depend to a limited extent on the actual internal representation of the spatio-temporal data. genericity is defined as invariance under groups of geometric transformations that preserve certain characteristics of spatio-temporal data (e.g., collinearity, distance, velocity, acceleration, …). these groups depend on the notions that are relevant in particular spatio-temporal database applications. these transformations also have the distinctive property that they respect the monotone and unidirectional nature of time.  we investigate different genericity classes with respect to the constraint database model for spatio-temporal databases and we identify sound and complete languages for the first-order and the computable queries in these genericity classes. we distinguish between genericity determined by time-invariant transformations, genericity notions concerning physical quantities and genericity determined by time-dependent transformations. in this paper, we study the expressive power and the complexity of first-order logic with arithmetic, as a query language over relational and constraint databases. we consider constraints over various domains (n, z, q, and r), and with various arithmetical operations (⩽, +, ×, etc.).    we first consider the data complexity of first-order queries. we prove in particular that linear queries can be evaluated in ac0 over finite integer databases, and in nc1 over linear constraint databases. this improves previously known bounds. we also show that over all domains, enough arithmetic lead to arithmetical queries, therefore, showing the frontiers of constraints for database purposes.    we then tackle the problem of the expressive power, with the definability of the parity and the connectivity, which are the most classical examples of queries not expressible in first-order logic over finite structures. we prove that these two queries are first-order definable in the presence of (enough) arithmetic. nevertheless, we show that they are not definable with constraints of interest for constraint databases such as linear constraints for instance. finally, we developed reduction techniques for queries over constraint databases, that allow us to draw conclusions with respect to their undefinability in various constraint query languages.
aromatic amines (aas) are an important class of chemicals which account for 12 % of known carcinogens. the biological effects of aas depend mainly on their biotransformation into reactive metabolites or into n-acetylated metabolites which are generally considered as less toxic. although the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) pathway by certain carcinogenic aas has been reported, the effects of their n-acetylated metabolites on the ahr have not been addressed. here, we investigated whether carcinogenic aas and their n-acetylated metabolites may activate/modulate the ahr pathway in the absence and/or the presence of a bona fide ahr ligand (benzo[a]pyrene/b(a)p]. in agreement with previous studies, we found that certain aas activated the ahr in human liver and lung cells as assessed by an increase in cytochrome p450 1a1 (cyp1a1) expression and activity. altogether, we report for the first time that these properties can be modulated by the n-acetylation status of the aa. whereas 2-naphthylamine significantly activated the ahr and induced cyp1a1 expression, its n-acetylated metabolite was less efficient. in contrast, the n-acetylated metabolite of 2-aminofluorene was able to significantly activate ahr, whereas the parent aa, 2-aminofluorene, did not. in the presence of b(a)p, activation of ahr or antagonist effects were observed depending on the aa or its n-acetylated metabolite. activation and/or modulation of the ahr pathway by aas and their n-acetylated metabolites may represent a novel mechanism contributing to the toxicological effects of aas. more broadly, our data suggest biological interactions between aas and other classes of xenobiotics through the ahr pathway. arylamines and heterocyclic arylamines (haas) are of particular interest because of demonstrated carcinogenicity in animals and humans and the broad exposure to many of these compounds. the activation of these, and also some arylamine drugs, involves n-hydroxylation, usually by cytochrome p450 (p450). p450 1a2 plays a prominent role in these reactions. however, p450 1a1 and 1b1 and other p450s are also important in humans as well as experimental animals. some arylamines (including drugs) are n-hydroxylated predominantly by p450s other than those in family 1. other oxygenases can also have roles. an important issue is extrapolation between species in predicting cancer risks, as shown by the low rates of haa activation by rat p450 1a2 and low levels of p450 1a2 expression in some nonhuman primates.
female-factor infertility can be caused by poor oocyte quality and depleted ovarian reserves. egg precursor cells (epcs), isolated from the ovarian cortex, have the potential to be used to overcome female infertility. we aimed to define the origins of epcs by analyzing their gene expression profiles and mtdna content using a mini-pig model. we characterized fac-sorted ddx4+-derived porcine epcs by performing rna-sequencing and determined that they utilize pathways important for cell cycle and proliferation, which supports the existence of adult mitotically active oogonial cells. expression of the pluripotent markers sox2 and oct4, and the primitive germ cell markers blimp1 and stella were not detected. however, nanog and ddx4 were expressed, as were the primitive germ cell markers fragilis, c-kit and tert. moreover, porcine epcs expressed self-renewal and proliferation markers including myc, esrrb, id2, klf4, klf5, stat3, fgfr1, fgfr2 and il6st. the presence of zp1, zp2, zp3 and nobox were not detected, indicating that porcine epcs are not indicative of mature primordial oocytes. we performed mitochondrial dna next generation sequencing and determined that one mtdna variant harbored by epcs was present in oocytes, preimplantation embryos and somatic tissues over three generations in our mini-pig model indicating the potential germline origin of epcs. abstract tor is a serine-threonine kinase that was originally identified as a target of rapamycin in saccharomyces cerevisiae and then found to be highly conserved among eukaryotes. in drosophila melanogaster, inactivation of tor or its substrate, s6 kinase, results in reduced cell size and embryonic lethality, indicating a critical role for the tor pathway in cell growth control. however, the in vivo functions of mammalian tor (mtor) remain unclear. in this study, we disrupted the kinase domain of mouse mtor by homologous recombination. while heterozygous mutant mice were normal and fertile, homozygous mutant embryos died shortly after implantation due to impaired cell proliferation in both embryonic and extraembryonic compartments. homozygous blastocysts looked normal, but their inner cell mass and trophoblast failed to proliferate in vitro. deletion of the c-terminal six amino acids of mtor, which are essential for kinase activity, resulted in reduced cell size and proliferation arrest in embryonic stem cells. these data show that mtor controls both cell size and proliferation in early mouse embryos and embryonic stem cells.
backgroundthe purpose of this study was to evaluate surgical outcomes of arthroscopic débridement for lateral epicondylitis using a validated, patient-assessed scoring system as well as conventional outcome measures. we also wanted to identify potential predictive factors that may be associated with the outcomes.methodsa total of 20 elbows in 18 patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis who underwent arthroscopic surgery were included. there were nine men and nine women with a mean age of 54 years (range 42–71 years). operative treatment consisted of débridement of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ecrb) origin and resection of the radiocapitellar synovial plica interposed in the joint. outcomes were assessed using a patient rating, visual analogue scale (vas) pain score, the japanese orthopaedic association (joa) elbow score, and the disability of the arm, shoulder, and hand (dash) questionnaire. the average length of follow-up was 28 months (range 24–40 months).resultsafter surgery, according to the patients’ reports, 14 of 20 elbows were much better, and 6 elbows were better. a mean preoperative vas pain score at rest of 3.9 points improved to 0.3 points (p < 0.0001), and that during activity improved from 7.8 points to 0.9 points (p < 0.0001). the mean preoperative joa elbow score of 29 points was improved to 90 points (p < 0.0001). the mean postoperative dash score was 10.6 (range 0–50). absent of t2-weighted high signal focus of the ecrb origin on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (mri) (p = 0.02) and receiving public assistance (p = 0.01) were significantly associated with worse dash scores.conclusionsarthroscopic release was a satisfactory procedure for chronic lateral epicondylitis. preoperative mri of the ecrb origin and socioeconomic factors were significantly associated with postoperative residual symptoms evaluated with the dash score. background there are several alternative indicators of income information, which is a fundamental measure of individual socioeconomic position. in this study, we compared the degrees of associations of four types of income information with health variables among japanese adults. methods using a nationally representative sample of 29,446 men and 32,917 women aged 20 years and over, the associations between four income indicators and health variables were examined using the odds ratio in logistic regression analysis and the concentration index by sex and age group (20-59 years and 60+ years). income indicators consisted of total household income, equivalent household income, total household expenditure, and equivalent household expenditure. current smoking and self-rated health statuses were used as health variables. results a low income was associated with a high prevalence of smoking and fair/poor self-rated health, with some differences among sex and age groups and income indicators, but less difference among methods of statistical analyses. total and equivalent incomes were similarly and more markedly associated with smoking and self-rated health statuses, whereas equivalent expenditure showed the smallest degree of health difference. for the population aged 60+ years, the degree of health differences in smoking was similar between income and expenditure. conclusions although the degree of income-related health differences is dependent on health outcome and both sex and age group, this study suggests that either crude or equivalent household income is a useful indicator for health inequality among japanese adults.
a prerequisite for any function in social cognition is the perception and processing of social cues. age estimation is a skill that is used in everyday life and is fundamental in social interactions. this study evaluated whether facial age estimation is impaired in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer's disease (ad). the current age of faces is known to have an impact on age estimation, and therefore stimuli belonging to different age groups (young, middle-aged, and older adults' faces) were used. as expected, an impairment of age estimation from faces was observed in mild to moderate ad patients. however, the profile of impairment depended on the age of faces and stage of the disease. mild ad patients presented difficulties mainly in assessing the age of middle-aged adults. in moderate disease stage, these difficulties also affected the age estimation of young adult faces. interestingly, ad patients remained relatively good at estimating the age of older adults' faces, compared to healthy controls. an own-age bias in age estimation of faces. evelyne moyse university of li`ege serge br´ edart university of li`ege abstract: the occurrence of an own-age bias on age estimation of faces was assessed by comparing children (10-14), young (20-30) and older (65-75) adults’ performances. participants from each age group estimated both in-group and out-group faces. overall, the age of children’s faces was more accurately estimated than the age of both young and older adult faces. moreover, the age of young adult faces was more accurately estimated than that of older adults. a significant ”age of participants” x ”age of face stimuli” interaction was revealed. although we did not observe a crossed interaction where each age group would have been more accurate for in-group estimation than for out-group estimation, present results reveal the occurrence of an own-age bias in age estimation. there was no significant difference between the three groups when estimating child faces, but young and older adults were more accurate for in-group estimation than the other groups of participants.
pi4kiiiα is targeted to the plasma membrane via an evolutionarily conserved complex comprised of efr3 and ttc7 to control ptdins4p synthesis and the selective enrichment of ptdins(4,5)p2 in this membrane. abstract the stt4 phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase has been shown to generate a pool of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (pi4p) at the plasma membrane, critical for actin cytoskeleton organization and cell viability. to further understand the essential role of stt4-mediated pi4p production, we performed a genetic screen using the stt4ts mutation to identify candidate regulators and effectors of pi4p. from this analysis, we identified several genes that have been previously implicated in lipid metabolism. in particular, we observed synthetic lethality when both sphingolipid and pi4p synthesis were modestly diminished. consistent with these data, we show that the previously characterized phosphoinositide effectors, slm1 and slm2, which regulate actin organization, are also necessary for normal sphingolipid metabolism, at least in part through regulation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, which binds directly to both proteins. additionally, we identify isc1, an inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase c, as an additional target of slm1 and slm2 negative regulation. together, our data suggest that slm1 and slm2 define a molecular link between phosphoinositide and sphingolipid signaling and thereby regulate actin cytoskeleton organization.
purpose to document the sequence of bone formation in a minipig model of le fort i distraction osteogenesis (do) using immunohistochemistry and histomorphometry.   materials and methods female yucatan minipigs (n = 9) in the mixed-dentition stage underwent bilateral maxillary do. the distraction protocol was 0 days of latency, with a distraction rate of 1 mm/d for 12 days and 24 days of fixation. specimens were harvested and divided between the central incisors (18 hemi-maxillae) at the end of do (n = 6), at mid-fixation (n = 6), and at the end of fixation (n = 6). sections, including the advancement zone, were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, collagen ii, cd34, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. light and fluorescence microscope images (original magnification ×200) were obtained, and percentage of surface area (psa) of the advancement zone occupied by fibrous tissue, vessels, proliferating cells, osteoid, and bone was determined. an intact maxilla served as the control.   results at the end of do, in the advancement zone, the psa (mean values) of proliferating cells was 33.16%; fibrous tissue, 52%; vessels, 4.35%; and new bone, 5.45%. at the end of fixation, the psa of proliferating cells decreased to 10.53%, fibrous tissue to 2.3%, and vessels to 1.5% whereas the psa of new bone increased to 44.9%.   conclusions the results of this study indicate that the progression of osteogenesis in the maxillary do wound begins with intense cellular proliferation and vascular fibrous tissue formation and progresses to mature, cancellous bone by the end of fixation. the psa occupied by mature bone is significantly less than in the control maxilla at the end of fixation. this is consistent with the sequence in the mandibular do wound. the theoretic advantage of distraction osteogenesis of the craniofacial skeleton, especially in cases of severe midface retrusion and in the presence of maxillary scarring, is prevention of relapse following significant advancements. the purpose of this study is to demonstrate the utility of a new low-profile, intraoral, internal device for midface distraction at the conventional or high le fort i level. in addition, the present study compares the efficacy of immediate versus delayed distraction on subsequent maxillary relapse. four adult rhesus macaca mulatta monkeys were divided into two groups. group 1 underwent immediate midface distraction; group 2 underwent delayed distraction. all four monkeys underwent a modified le fort i osteotomy through an upper buccal sulcus incision and bilateral application of the intraoral midface distraction devices. no other osteotomies or incisions were necessary. immediate distraction, performed in group 1, entailed intraoperative activation of the devices and distraction of 10 mm followed by a 5-day lag period before postoperative activation and distraction of an additional 10 mm at the rate of 1 mm/day. delayed distraction, performed in group 2, entailed a 5-day postoperative lag period before device activation and distraction of 20 mm at the rate of 1 mm/day. both groups thus underwent 20 mm of midface distraction. all devices were removed 6 weeks after completion of distraction. all monkeys tolerated the devices and daily distraction uneventfully. on the basis of serial cephalograms and dental models obtained throughout the experimental period, there was no evidence of relapse in either the immediate or delayed groups 6 months after distraction. in addition, on the basis of histologic, ultrastructural, and dry skull analysis, no significant differences were observed in the quality of regenerate bone obtained when comparing the immediate and delayed distraction groups. significant midface advancement is thus feasible using this new internal, intraoral distraction device, which presents several advantages over other internal devices that require coronal incisions and additional osteotomies to achieve midface advancement. in addition, immediate distraction may abbreviate the distraction period without adverse sequelae.
this article discusses monozygotic twin patients with van der woude syndrome, the most common form of syndromic cleft lip and palate, who have concordant manifestations. the syndrome has an autosomal dominant hereditary pattern with variable expressivity and a high degree of penetrance with clinical features, including lower lip sinuses with a cleft lip, cleft palate, or both. some mutations have been found to cause this disorder. genetic counseling and informing patients about inheritance is crucial. the appearance, etiology, genetic aspects, differential diagnosis, and treatment modalities are discussed. to the authors' knowledge, this is the third report of monozygotic concordant twins with this syndrome in the literature. by three pedigree and statistical criteria van der woude syndrome (vws) appears to have been underreported and frequently not diagnosed. eight percent of gene carriers are not diagnosed because they are nonpenetrant. but among penetrant gene carriers as many as 80% may not have been recognized in the past. a direct estimate of incidence of vws is 3.6/100,000 births; indirect estimates are more than double that. the relative risk of inheriting a cleft from an affected parent is 22.43%; the risk of inheriting lip pits only, or being nonpenetrant is 27.57%. (this corrects a similar statement in the abstract of burdick et al [j craniofacial genet dev biol 5:181-208, 1985], which was incorrectly calculated). the idea of unitary control of the action of the vws gene in the three target tissues appears not to be supported. rather, we tend to support the idea that the gene is controlled independently in the three tissues. indications of a family at risk are listed and discussed.
peripheral arterial disease, being a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis, carries a high risk of adverse cardiovascular events. secondary medical prevention therapies of same magnitude as that for coronary artery disease are recommended for peripheral arterial disease patients also. available evidence indicates that this condition commonly remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. there is lack of any report about management of these patients in india. the objectives of the present study were to characterize the atherosclerotic risk factor profile and pattern of drug prescription for patients of peripheral arterial disease at a tertiary care teaching hospital and to compare this management with standard guidelines. data were collected from prescriptions of patients attending cardiothoracic and vascular surgery outpatient department with diagnosis of atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease from july 2012 to jun 2013. one hundred twenty prescriptions were analysed. the mean age (±sd) of patients was 53±7.18 years and 23.3% were females. history of smoking, either past or present, was present in 91.6% patients. history of ischemic heart disease was present in 25%, while 26.7% patients were diabetic. mean number of cardiovascular risk factors was 2.6. the percentage of eligible patients who were receiving a particular drug was 100% for aspirin and statins, 48.3% for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, 46.7% for beta blockers and 66.7% for cilostazol. the vascular surgeons of this centre are using antiplatelet agents and statins adequately for peripheral arterial disease. the prescription of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers and cilostazol is low. exercise therapy and smoking cessation need more attention. background previous investigators have observed a doubling of the mortality rate among patients with intermittent claudication, and we have reported a fourfold increase in the overall mortality rate among subjects with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease, as diagnosed by noninvasive testing. in this study, we investigated the association of large-vessel peripheral arterial disease with rates of mortality from all cardiovascular diseases and from coronary heart disease.   methods we examined 565 men and women (average age, 66 years) for the presence of large-vessel peripheral arterial disease by means of two noninvasive techniques--measurement of segmental blood pressure and determination of flow velocity by doppler ultrasound. we identified 67 subjects with the disease (11.9 percent), whom we followed prospectively for 10 years.   results twenty-one of the 34 men (61.8 percent) and 11 of the 33 women (33.3 percent) with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease died during follow-up, as compared with 31 of the 183 men (16.9 percent) and 26 of the 225 women (11.6 percent) without evidence of peripheral arterial disease. after multivariate adjustment for age, sex, and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the relative risk of dying among subjects with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease as compared with those with no evidence of such disease was 3.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 4.9) for deaths from all causes, 5.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.0 to 11.4) for all deaths from cardiovascular disease, and 6.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 14.9) for deaths from coronary heart disease. the relative risk of death from causes other than cardiovascular disease was not significantly increased among the subjects with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease. after the exclusion of subjects who had a history of cardiovascular disease at base line, the relative risks among those with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease remained significantly elevated. additional analyses revealed a 15-fold increase in rates of mortality due to cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease among subjects with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease that was both severe and symptomatic.   conclusions patients with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease have a high risk of death from cardiovascular causes.
objective to evaluate cortical activation patterns during mechanical-tactile stimulation in fibromyalgia syndrome (fms) patients and to correlate cortical activation changes with clinical symptoms.   methods nineteen female fms patients and 18 matched, healthy control subjects underwent eeg examination during brushing stimulation of the right forearm. participants rated any pain experienced and underwent a manual tender point scale (mtps) examination. amplitude changes of cortical rhythms during brushing were analysed in alpha (8-13 hz) and beta (16-24 hz) frequency bands.   results thirteen patients reported pain during brushing. independent t-test comparison of event related desynchronisation (erd) during brushing revealed a cluster of electrodes over ipsilateral (right) central-parietal region which demonstrated erd in patients only. clinical mtps scores correlated with beta-band erd in this cluster of electrodes. beamformer analysis revealed a widespread array of source activations in patients, including bilateral insula and primary and secondary somatosensory cortices. control subject source activations were limited to contralateral (left) hemisphere.   conclusions results indicate ipsilateral cortical activations in fms patients, but not in healthy controls, during brushing. ipsilateral erd during brushing is associated with mtps score suggesting abnormal processing of somatosensory input which may contribute to clinical pain.   significance altered functioning in fms may reflect physiological changes in response to afferent somatosensory information manifesting in chronic pain. objective: to investigate cerebral activations underlying touch-evoked pain (dynamic–mechanical allodynia) in patients with neuropathic pain. methods: fmri was used in 12 patients with complex regional pain syndromes (crpss). allodynia was elicited by gently brushing the affected crps hand. elicited pain ratings were recorded online to obtain pain-weighted predictors. both activations and deactivations of blood oxygenation level–dependent signals were investigated. results: nonpainful stimulation on the nonaffected hand activated contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (s1), bilateral insula, and secondary somatosensory cortices (s2). in contrast, allodynia led to widespread cerebral activations, including contralateral s1 and motor cortex (m1), parietal association cortices (pa), bilateral s2, insula, frontal cortices, and both anterior and posterior parts of the cingulate cortex (aacc and pacc). deactivations were detected in the visual, vestibular, and temporal cortices. when rating-weighted predictors were implemented, only few activations remained (s1/pa cortex, bilateral s2/insular cortices, pacc). conclusions: allodynic stimulation recruits a complex cortical network. activations include not only nociceptive but also motor and cognitive processing. using a covariance approach (i.e., implementation of rating-weighted predictors) facilitates the detection of a neuronal matrix involved in the encoding of allodynia. the pattern of cortical deactivation during allodynia may hint at a shift of activation from tonically active sensory systems, like visual and vestibular cortices, into somatosensory-related brain areas.
type iii secretion is a tightly controlled virulence mechanism utilized by many gram negative bacteria to colonize their eukaryotic hosts. to infect their host, human pathogenic yersinia spp. translocate protein toxins into the host cell cytosol through a preassembled ysc-yop type iii secretion device. several of the ysc-yop components are known for their roles in controlling substrate secretion and translocation. particularly important in this role is the yopn and tyea heterodimer. in this study, we confirm that y. pseudotuberculosis naturally produce a 42 kda yopn-tyea hybrid protein as a result of a +1 frame shift near the 3 prime of yopn mrna, as has been previously reported for the closely related y. pestis. to assess the biological role of this yopn-tyea hybrid in t3ss by y. pseudotuberculosis, we used in cis site-directed mutagenesis to engineer bacteria to either produce predominately the yopn-tyea hybrid by introducing +1 frame shifts to yopn after codon 278 or 287, or to produce only singular yopn and tyea polypeptides by introducing yopn sequence from y. enterocolitica, which is known not to produce the hybrid. significantly, the engineered 42 kda yopn-tyea fusions were abundantly produced, stable, and were efficiently secreted by bacteria in vitro. moreover, these bacteria could all maintain functionally competent needle structures and controlled yops secretion in vitro. in the presence of host cells however, bacteria producing the most genetically altered hybrids (+1 frameshift after 278 codon) had diminished control of polarized yop translocation. this corresponded to significant attenuation in competitive survival assays in orally infected mice, although not at all to the same extent as yersinia lacking both yopn and tyea proteins. based on these studies with engineered polypeptides, most likely a naturally occurring yopn-tyea hybrid protein has the potential to influence t3s control and activity when produced during yersinia-host cell contact. pathogenic yersinia species employ type iii machines to target effector yops into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. yersinia tyea mutants are thought to be defective in the targeting of yope and yoph without affecting the injection of yopm, yopn, yopo, yopp, and yopt into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. one model suggests that tyea may form a tether between yopn (lcre) and yopd on the bacterial surface, a structure that may translocate yope and yoph across the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells (m. iriarte, m. p. sory, a. boland, a. p. boyd, s. d. mills, i. lambermont, and g. r. cornelis, embo j. 17:1907-1918, 1998). we have examined the injection of yop proteins by tyea mutant yersiniae with the digitonin fractionation technique. we find that tyea mutant yersiniae not only secreted yope, yoph, yopm, and yopn into the extracellular medium but also targeted these polypeptides into the cytosol of hela cells. protease protection, cell fractionation, and affinity purification experiments suggest that tyea is located intracellularly and binds to yopn or yopd. we propose a model whereby tyea functions as a negative regulator of the type iii targeting pathway in the cytoplasm of yersiniae, presumably by preventing the export of yopn.
this paper describes the procedure of assembling a miniature microdrive and silicon probe system for surgical implantation into the adult rat brain. successful recordings of single and multiunit activity with parallel depth profiles of spontaneous and evoked field potentials are shown. the procedure for histological verification of the position of the silicon probe is described. the contribution of the various hippocampal regions to the maintenance of epileptic activity, induced by stimulation of the perforant path or commissural system, was examined in the awake rat. combination of multiple-site recordings with silicon probes, current source density analysis and unit recordings allowed for a high spatial resolution of the field events. following perforant path stimulation, seizures began in the dentate gyrus, followed by events in the ca3-ca1 regions. after commissural stimulation, rhythmic bursts in the ca3-ca1 circuitry preceded the activation of the dentate gyrus. correlation of events in the different subregions indicated that the sustained rhythmic afterdischarge (2-6 hz) could not be explained by a cycle-by-cycle excitation of principal cell populations in the hippocampal-entorhinal loop. the primary afterdischarge always terminated in the ca1 region, followed by the dentate gyrus, ca3 region and the entorhinal cortex. the duration and pattern of the hippocampal afterdischarge was essentially unaffected by removal of the entorhinal cortex. the emergence of large population spike bursts coincided with a decreased discharge of interneurons in both ca1 and hilar regions. the majority of hilar interneurons displayed a strong amplitude decrement prior to the onset of population spike phase of the afterdischarge. these findings suggest that (i) afterdischarges can independently arise in the ca3-ca1 and entorhinal dentate gyrus circuitries, (ii) reverberation of excitation in the hippocampal-entorhinal loop is not critical for the maintenance of afterdischarges and (iii) decreased activity of the interneuronal network may release population bursting of principal cells.
dna damage repair elements accumulate at dna damage sites to form ionizing radiation-induced foci (irif) for damage repair. irif, which represent direct evidence of dna damage response activity, which are conveniently to be observed via immunofluorescence staining. protein ubiquitination plays an important role in initiating the dna damage response. following dna damage, the substrate binding protein e3 ubiquitin–ligases enzymes are recruited to dna damage sites, then the e2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes are recruited to these sites by the e3 where they catalyze protein ubiquitination. however, irif of e2 enzymes are relatively transient and unstable in vivo and difficult to detect. here, we present a new method for the observation of e2 irif. this method is based on the co-transfection of interacting e2 and e3 enzymes into cells and identifies irif via immunofluorescence following dna damage. dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) not only interrupt the genetic information, but also disrupt the chromatin structure, and both impairments require repair mechanisms to ensure genome integrity. we showed previously that rnf8-mediated chromatin ubiquitylation protects genome integrity by promoting the accumulation of repair factors at dsbs. here, we provide evidence that, while rnf8 is necessary to trigger the dsb-associated ubiquitylations, it is not sufficient to sustain conjugated ubiquitin in this compartment. we identified rnf168 as a novel chromatin-associated ubiquitin ligase with an ability to bind ubiquitin. we show that rnf168 interacts with ubiquitylated h2a, assembles at dsbs in an rnf8-dependent manner, and, by targeting h2a and h2ax, amplifies local concentration of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin conjugates to the threshold required for retention of 53bp1 and brca1. thus, rnf168 defines a new pathway involving sequential ubiquitylations on damaged chromosomes and uncovers a functional cooperation between e3 ligases in genome maintenance.
understanding how life arose is a fundamental problem of biology. much progress has been made by adopting a synthetic and mechanistic perspective on originating life. we present a current view of the biochemistry of the origin of life, focusing on issues surrounding the emergence of an rna world in which rna dominated informational and functional roles. there is cause for optimism on this difficult problem: the prebiotic chemical inventory may not have been as nightmarishly complex as previously thought; the catalytic repertoire of ribozymes continues to expand, approaching the goal of self-replicating rna; encapsulation in protocells provides evolutionary and biophysical advantages. nevertheless, major issues remain unsolved, such as the origin of a genetic code. attention to this field is particularly timely given the accelerating discovery and characterization of exoplanets. there is very significant evidence that cognate codons and/or anticodons are unexpectedly frequent in rna-binding sites for seven of eight biological amino acids that have been tested. this suggests that a substantial fraction of the genetic code has a stereochemical basis, the triplets having escaped from their original function in amino acid-binding sites to become modern codons and anticodons. we explicitly show that this stereochemical basis is consistent with subsequent optimization of the code to minimize the effect of coding mistakes on protein structure. these data also strengthen the argument for invention of the genetic code in an rna world and for the rna world itself.
the progression of hypertension to cardiac failure involves systemic changes that may ultimately affect contractility throughout the heart. spontaneous hypertensive heart failure (shhf) rats have depressed left ventricular (lv) function, but right ventricular (rv) dysfunction is less well characterized. ultrathin (87 +/- 5 mircom) trabeculae were isolated from end-stage failing shhf rats and from age-matched controls. under near-physiological conditions (1 mm ca(2+), 37 degrees c, 4 hz), developed force (in mn/mm(2)) was not significantly different in shhf lv and rv trabeculae and those of controls. shhf lv preparations displayed a negative force-frequency behavior (40 +/- 7 vs. 23 +/- 4 mn/mm(2), 2 vs. 7 hz); this relationship was positive in shhf rv preparations (27 +/- 5 vs. 40 +/- 6 mn/mm(2)) and controls (32 +/- 6 vs. 44 +/- 9 mn/mm(2)). the response to isoproterenol (10(-6) m, 4 hz) was depressed in shhf lv preparations. the inotropic response to hypothermia was lost in shhf lv trabeculae but preserved in shhf rv trabeculae. intracellular calcium measurements revealed impaired calcium handling at higher frequencies in lv preparations. we conclude that in end-stage failing shhf rats, rv function is only marginally affected, whereas a severe contractile dysfunction of lv myocardium is present. myocardial failure in dilated cardiomyopathy may result from subcellular alterations in contractile protein function, excitation-contraction coupling processes, or recovery metabolism. we used isometric force and heat measurements to quantitatively investigate these subcellular systems in intact left ventricular muscle strips from nonfailing human hearts (n = 14) and from hearts with end-stage failing dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 13). in the failing myocardium, peak isometric twitch tension, maximum rate of tension rise, and maximum rate of relaxation were reduced by 46% (p = 0.013), 51% (p = 0.003), and 46% (p = 0.018), respectively (37 degrees c, 60 beats per minute). tension-dependent heat, reflecting the number of crossbridge interactions during the isometric twitch, was reduced by 61% in the failing myocardium (p = 0.006). in terms of the individual crossbridge cycle, the average crossbridge force-time integral was increased by 33% (p = 0.04) in the failing myocardium. in the nonfailing myocardium, the crossbridge force-time integral was positively correlated with the patient's age (r = 0.86, p less than 0.02), whereas there was no significant correlation with age in the failing group. the amount and rate of excitation-contraction coupling-related heat evolution (tension-independent heat) were reduced by 69% (p = 0.24) and 71% (p = 0.028), respectively, in the failing myocardium, reflecting a considerable decrease in the amount of calcium released and in the rate of calcium removal. the efficiency of the metabolic recovery process, as assessed by the ratio of initial heat to total activity-related heat, was similar in failing and nonfailing myocardium (0.54 +/- 0.03 versus 0.50 +/- 0.02, p = 0.23).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

the etiology of behavioral precursors to substance misuse and aggression is viewed from the perspective of a developmental, multifactorial model of complex disorders. beginning at conception, genetic and environmental interactions have potential to produce a sequence of behavioral phenotypes during development that bias the trajectory toward high-risk outcomes. one pathway is theorized to emanate from a deviation in neurological development that predisposes children to affective and cognitive delays or impairments that, in turn, generate dysregulatory behaviors. the plasticity of these neurobiological systems is highly relevant to the prevention sciences; their functions are reliant upon environmental inputs and can be altered, for better or for worse, contingent upon the nature of the inputs. thus, social contextual factors confer significant influence on the development of this neural network and behavioral outcomes by increasing risk for, or protecting against, dysregulatory outcomes. a well-designed intervention can exploit the brain's plasticity by targeting biological and social factors at sensitive time points to positively influence emergent neurobiological functions and related behaviors. accordingly, prevention research is beginning to focus on perturbations in developmental neural plasticity during childhood that increase the likelihood of risky behaviors and may also moderate intervention effects on behavior. given that the more complex features of neurobiological functions underlying drug misuse and aggression (e.g., executive cognitive function, coping skills, affect regulation) do not coalesce until early adulthood when prefrontal-limbic brain networks consolidate, it is critical that mechanisms underlying developmental risk factors are identified. an empirically driven prevention approach, thus, may benefit from consideration of (i) the type, effect, and developmental timing of the environmental impact on the brain, and (ii) the type and effect on brain function, and developmental timing of the intervention. this translational approach promises to eventually offer some direction for the design of effective interventions to prevent drug misuse and concomitant aggression. stress causes rapid and transient expression of immediate early genes (iegs) in the brain, and the monitoring of iegs has enabled the visualization of the neurocircuitry of stress. previous studies have postulated that stressors can be divided into two categories; processive and systemic. the neural circuits of brain activation differ between the two kinds of stressors. for example, processive stressors, such as immobilization (imo), induce c-fos mrna first in the cortical and limbic areas and then in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (pvh), while c-fos expression in the pvh precedes that in other areas in animals subjected to systemic stressors. we further show that prior exposure to imo stress for 6 days, or implantation of corticosterone pellets suppresses the induction of c-fos, fos b, jun b and ngfi-b, but not that of ngfi-a in the rat pvh. plasma glucocorticoid may be an important factor regulating stress-induced ieg expression. it is well known that ap-1 and glucocorticoid receptors (gr) interact and suppress each other. thus, decreased ap-1 levels in chronically stressed animals may help enhance the negative feedback effects of gr and prevent hypersecretion of glucocorticoid, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of stress-related diseases. imo stress induces rapid expression of c-fos, c-jun and ngfi-a mrnas in the heart and stomach. these were observed in the ventricular myocardium and coronary arteries, and in the epithelium, smooth muscles and arteries of the stomach after 30 min of imo. ieg expression in the peripheral organs may provide a molecular basis for stress-induced psychosomatic disorders.
background: nephrotoxicity is one of the most important limitations of cisplatin-based chemotherapies which associated with many complications and high mortality rate. objectives: to investigate the effect of lycopene on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in patients with cancer. patients and methods: in this double-blind, randomized clinical trial, 120 patients were randomly assigned to two groups, case (treated with lycopene + standard regimen of kidney injury prevention) and control (treated with only the standard regimen of kidney injury prevention). lycopene was orally taken from 24 hours before to 72 hours after cisplatin administration. blood urea nitrogen (bun), serum creatinine (cr), and glomerular filtration rate (gfr) were measured and recorded. the data were analyzed using spss. results: changes in cr were not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.131). however, a significant decreasing trend was seen in gfr during the study, which was more marked in the control group (p = 0.004). bun significantly decreased during the study (p = 0.002), and a significant decrease of bun on the day three in both groups was seen (p = 0.001). however, bun increased in the case group on the day 21 of treatment. the corresponding increase was less marked in the control group. conclusions: lycopene can be considered a useful adjuvant therapy to decrease the complications due to cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in patients with cancer. background: nephrotoxicity is the major side-effect of cisplatin (cddp), and it is reported to be gender-related. we evaluated the effects of pomegranate flower extract (pfe) as an antioxidant on cddp-induced nephrotoxicity in female rats. methods: twenty-three adult female rats in four groups treated as following. groups 1 and 2 received pfe at doses of 25 and 50 (mg/kg/day), respectively, for 9 days, and from day 3 on, they also received cisplatin (cddp) (2.5 mg/kg) daily. group 3 was treated as group 1 expects saline instead of pfe, and group 4 received pfe (25 mg/kg/day) alone. results: cisplatin alone increased the serum levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and nitrite; and kidney tissue damage score and kidney weight. however, pfe not only did not ameliorate the induced nephrotoxicity, but also aggravated renal tissue damage. conclusions: pomegranate extract as an antioxidant did not ameliorate cddp-induced nephrotoxicity in female rats.
summarybackground. heterogeneity in clinical presentation and daytime somnolence in restless legs syndrome (rls) have been poorly explored in the uk.  material and methods. analysis of database of 152 cases of primary rls compiled from clinical consultation using a structured questionnaire administration and clinical examination, spanning six years of referral. standard evaluations included use of the epworth sleepiness scale (ess). secondary rls was excluded and polysomnography performed in some when clinically indicated.  results. the mean duration of rls before appropriate treatment initiation was 12.7 years (age range of patients 26–90 years). 79% of patients had insomnia while 30% had excessive daytime sleepiness (eds). severe pain, restless arms and paroxysmal rls causing lifestyle alterations also occurred.  conclusions. this study suggests that there is considerable delay before appropriate therapy in rls. a large number have eds and insomnia among others, is the commonest presenting feature. phenotypic heterogeneity may cause diagnostic difficulty. objectives to assess the frequency, impact, and medical response to the restless legs syndrome (rls) in a large multi-national primary care population.   method questionnaire surveys of matched patients and primary care physicians (pcps) in five modern industrialized western countries.   results an rls screening questionnaire was completed by 23,052 patients: 2223 (9.6%) reported weekly rls symptoms; 1557 of these patients had medical follow-up questionnaires completed both by themselves and by their physician. an rls sufferer subgroup (n=551) likely warranting treatment was defined as reporting at least twice weekly symptoms with appreciable negative impact on quality of life. a total of 88.4% of rls sufferers reported at least one sleep-related symptom. most reported impaired sleep consistent with a diagnosis of insomnia. out of 551 sufferers, 357 (64.8%) reported consulting a physician about their rls symptoms, but only 46 of these 357 (12.9%) reported having been given a diagnosis. pcps reported that 209 (37.9%) rls sufferers consulted them about rls symptoms, but only 52 (24.9%) were given an rls diagnosis. in most countries, sufferers, regardless of diagnosis, were prescribed therapies not known to be effective in rls.   conclusions rls significantly impairs patients' lives, often by severely disrupting sleep. the marked under-diagnosis and inappropriate treatment of rls indicates that pcps need better education about this condition. recognizing how often disrupted sleep results from rls should improve diagnosis.
sister chromatid cohesion is essential for chromosome segregation and is mediated by cohesin bound to dna. cohesin-dna interactions can be reversed by the cohesion-associated protein wapl, whereas a stably dna-bound form of cohesin is thought to mediate cohesion. in vertebrates, sororin is essential for cohesion and stable cohesin-dna interactions, but how sororin performs these functions is unknown. we show that dna replication and cohesin acetylation promote binding of sororin to cohesin, and that sororin displaces wapl from its binding partner pds5. in the absence of wapl, sororin becomes dispensable for cohesion. we propose that sororin maintains cohesion by inhibiting wapl's ability to dissociate cohesin from dna. sororin has only been identified in vertebrates, but we show that many invertebrate species contain sororin-related proteins, and that one of these, dalmatian, is essential for cohesion in drosophila. the mechanism we describe here may therefore be widely conserved among different species. cohesin's smc1, smc3, and scc1 subunits form a tripartite ring that entraps sister dnas. scc3, pds5, and rad61 (wapl) are regulatory subunits that control this process. we describe here smc3, scc3, pds5, and rad61 mutations that permit yeast cell proliferation and entrapment of sister dnas by cohesin rings in the absence of eco1, an acetyl transferase normally essential for establishing sister chromatid cohesion. the smc3 mutations cluster around and include a highly conserved lysine (k113) close to smc3's atp-binding pocket, which, together with k112, is acetylated by eco1. lethality caused by mutating both residues to arginine is suppressed by the scc3, pds5, and rad61 mutants. scc3, pds5, and rad61 form a complex and inhibit entrapment of sister dnas by a process involving the "k112/k113" surface on smc3's atpase. according to this model, eco1 promotes sister dna entrapment partly by relieving an antiestablishment activity associated with scc3, pds5, and rad61.
ninety 1-day old broiler chicks of mixed gender (as hatched) procured from a local hatchery were randomly divided into five equal groups. all the treatments were given through crop tubing. groups 1-4 received cypermethrin (cy) (600mgkg(-1)b. wt.) daily for 30 days. in addition to cy (group 1), groups 2-4 received vit e (150mgkg(-1)b. wt.), se (0.25mgkg(-1)b. wt.), and vit e (150mgkg(-1)b. wt.)+se (0.25mgkg(-1)b. wt.), respectively. group 5 served as control andreceived normal saline (2mlkg(-1)b. wt.) for 30 days. randomly selected six broiler chicks from each group were slaughtered at experimental days 10, 20 and 30 for the collection of serum/plasma and morbid tissues. absolute organ weights were recorded. total plasma proteins, fibrinogen and creatinine were significantly (p<0.05) increased while alkaline phosphatase (alp), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and urea decreased significantly (p<0.05) in cy-treated group when compared with the control group. kidneys were swollen grossly in treated broiler chicks. in liver, necrosis of hepatocytes, cytoplasmic vacuolation, bile duct hyperplasia and mononuclear cellular infiltration were observed. in kidneys, necrosis of tubular epithelial cells, cytoplasmic vacuolation, cellular infiltration and atrophy of glomeruli were observed. sub-arachnoid space was much dilated in cy-treated broiler chicks. it can be concluded that cy induces biochemical and histopathological alterations in broilers chicks; however, these toxic effects can be ameliorated by vit e or se. combination of vit e and se was more effective in ameliorating toxic effects of cypermethrin in broilers chicks. this study was carried out on 90 one-day-old broiler chicks to know clinico-hematological alterations, dna damage caused by cypermethrin (cy), and attenuation of toxic effects by vitamin e (vit e) and selenium (se). birds were randomly divided into five equal groups. groups 1-4 received cy (600mlkg(-1)b.wt) daily for 30 days by crop tubing. in addition to cy, groups 2, 3 and 4 received vit e (150mgkg(-1)b.wt), se (0.25mgkg(-1)b.wt), and vit e (150mgkg(-1)b.wt)+se (0.25mgkg(-1)b.wt), respectively. group 5 served as control. birds were monitored twice daily for clinical signs. they were weighed and blood samples were collected at experimental days 10, 20 and 30 for hematological studies. cy-treated birds showed more prominent signs of toxicity compared to cy+vit e, cy+se and cy+vit e+se birds. body weight in groups 1-3 was significantly (p<0.05) smaller at days 20 and 30 when compared with the control group. significantly (p<0.001) higher numbers of micronuclei appeared in chicks treated with cy compared to cy+vit e- and cy+se-treated birds. significantly decreased total erythrocyte counts (tec), hemoglobin (hb) concentration and packed cell volume (pcv) in all treated groups were recorded. treated birds suffered from macrocytic hypochromic anemia. leukocytosis in early stage and later leucopenia was seen in treated birds. it can be concluded that cy induces toxic effects in broilers chicks; however, these toxic effects can be ameliorated by vit e or se. combination of vit e and se was more effective to ameliorate toxic effects of cypermethrin.
objectivesthis study was designed to determine the effectiveness of a percutaneously inserted coil as a landmark before radiofrequency ablation (rfa) of poorly visible liver tumors on unenhanced computed tomography and ultrasound.methodsthis was a single-center, retrospective study of 46 consecutive patients treated from january 2008 to june 2012 with rfa under ct guidance for 57 poorly visible liver tumors after percutaneous coil insertion. effectiveness was evaluated by the rate of local tumor progression (ltp), and the risk factors of ltp were evaluated by multiple univariate analysis.resultsafter a mean follow-up of 15.9 months, the overall rate of ltp was 22.8 % (13/57). an increase in the distance between the coil and the center of the tumor was a predictive factor of ltp (p = 0.005) and resulted in an increase in time to place the rfa probe. ltp was significantly reduced in case of coil placed within the tumor (10 vs. 43.5 %, p = 0.009).conclusionsthe effectiveness of the “coil-assisted” rfa for poorly visible liver tumors is improved by centering the coil in the tumor in order to facilitate the placement of the rfa probe and equal to the results of rfa under direct image guidance. new techniques of ct-guided management were introduced to ablate ultrasonically invisible hepatocellular carcinomas. in six patients with hcc, a total of six nodules (8–30 mm in diameter) were treated under the guidance of ct. these lesions were not visualized by sonography but were visualized as lipiodol spots on ct after chemoembolization. tumor localization was successful in all patients without difficulty, using a thin needle or hookwire under the guidance of ct. two patients underwent subsequent hepatic resection and/or microwave coagulation therapy (mct) through a small incision after hookwire placement. four patients received percutaneous mct (n = 2) or ethanol injection (pei) (n = 2) at the time of localization. the postoperative ct with contrast enhancement indicated that tumor ablation was complete in four of the five nodules treated with mct or pei. however, in one nodule (30 mm in diameter) treated with pei, tumor ablation was not complete. there were no complications. there has been no local tumor recurrence 6–46 months after treatment in any of the patients. in conclusion, these ct-guided procedures were effective in treating ultrasonically invisible hepatocellular carcinomas that otherwise would have remained untreated.
a clinicopathologic correlation between two patients with acute-onset aspergillus endophthalmitis undergoing enucleation is reported. these two patients presented with pain, redness, and decreased vision following uncomplicated cataract surgery. in both patients, vitreous aspiration and intravitreal injections were the initial treatment followed later by pars plana vitrectomy for clinical worsening. despite repeated surgical and medical interventions, the clinical course of both patients was prolonged, unsuccessful, and resulted in enucleation for a blind painful eye. histologic examination of the enucleated specimens showed that, in spite of prolonged local and systemic therapy, there was persistent diffuse infiltration of the anterior chamber and ciliary body by a filamentous mold. purpose to report a series of patients with early onset aspergillus endophthalmitis following cataract surgery.   design retrospective consecutive case series.   methods medical records were reviewed of all cases of endophthalmitis caused by aspergillus after cataract surgery treated at the authors' practices between 1992 and 2005.   results five patients were identified. two patients were immunocompromised (one on oral corticosteroids and one on chemotherapy for lung cancer). the mean number of days between cataract surgery and diagnosis with endophthalmitis was 29 (range, 10 to 62 days). three eyes (60%) were enucleated despite a variety of treatments. in addition to vitrectomy and injection of antifungal agents, the other two eyes underwent surgical debridement of a localized necrotic nidus. final visual acuity was 20/30 in one eye and 20/200 in the remaining eye.   conclusions aspergillus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of early onset endophthalmitis following cataract surgery. visual outcomes are generally poor and enucleation is common in these patients.
background frameshift mutations in microsatellite instability high (msi-high) colorectal cancers are a potential source of targetable neo-antigens. many nonsense transcripts are subject to rapid degradation due to nonsense-mediated decay (nmd), but nonsense transcripts with a cms in the last exon or near the last exon-exon junction have intrinsic resistance to nonsense-mediated decay (nmd). nmd-resistant transcripts are therefore a likely source of expressed mutant proteins in msi-high tumours. methods using antibodies to the conserved n-termini of predicted mutant proteins, we analysed msi-high colorectal cancer cell lines for examples of naturally expressed mutant proteins arising from frameshift mutations in coding microsatellites (cms) by immunoprecipitation and western blot experiments. detected mutant protein bands from nmd-resistant transcripts were further validated by gene-specific short-interfering rna (sirna) knockdown. a genome-wide search was performed to identify cms-containing genes likely to generate nmd-resistant transcripts that could encode for antigenic expressed mutant proteins in msi-high colon cancers. these genes were screened for cms mutations in the msi-high colon cancer cell lines. results mutant protein bands of expected molecular weight were detected in mutated msi-high cell lines for nmd-resistant transcripts (crebbp, ep300, ttk), but not nmd-sensitive transcripts (bax, casp5, msh3). expression of the mutant crebbp and ep300 proteins was confirmed by sirna knockdown. five cms-bearing genes identified from the genome-wide search and without existing mutation data (sfrs12ip1, med8, asxl1, fbxl3 and rgs12) were found to be mutated in at least 5 of 11 (45%) of the msi-high cell lines tested. conclusion nmd-resistant transcripts can give rise to expressed mutant proteins in msi-high colon cancer cells. if commonly expressed in primary msi-high colon cancers, msi-derived mutant proteins could be useful as cancer specific immunological targets in a vaccine targeting msi-high colonic tumours. high level microsatellite instability (msi-h) occurs in about 15% of colorectal cancer (crcs), either as sporadic cancers or in the context of hereditary non-polyposis cancer or lynch syndrome. in msi-h crc, mismatch repair deficiency leads to insertion/deletion mutations at coding microsatellites and thus to the translation of frameshift peptides (fsps). fsps are potent inductors of t cell responses in vitro and in vivo. the present study aims at the identification of fsp-specific humoral immune responses in msi-h crc and lynch syndrome. sera from patients with history of msi-h crc (n = 69), healthy lynch syndrome mutation carriers (n = 31) and healthy controls (n = 52) were analyzed for antibodies against fsps using peptide elisa. reactivities were measured against fsps derived from genes frequently mutated in msi-h crcs, aim2, tgfbr2, casp5, taf1b, znf294, and marcks. antibody reactivity against fsps was significantly higher in msi-h crc patients than in healthy controls (p = 0.036, mann–whitney) and highest in patients with shortest interval between tumor resection and serum sampling. humoral immune responses in patients were most frequently directed against fsps derived from mutated taf1b (11.6%, 8/69) and tgfbr2 (10.1%, 7/69). low level fsp-specific antibodies were also detected in healthy mutation carriers. our results show that antibody responses against fsps are detectable in msi-h crc patients and healthy lynch syndrome mutation carriers. based on the high number of defined fsp antigens, measuring fsp-specific humoral immune responses is a highly promising tool for future diagnostic application in msi-h cancer patients.
introduction elevated levels of chemokines have been reported in plasma and brain tissue of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (asd). the aim of this study was to examine chemokine levels in amniotic fluid (af) samples of individuals diagnosed with asd and their controls.   material and methods a danish historic birth cohort (hbc) kept at statens serum institute, copenhagen was utilized. using data from danish nation-wide health registers, a case-control study design of 414 cases and 820 controls was adopted. levels of mcp-1, mip-1α and rantes were analyzed using luminex xmap technology. case-control differences were assessed as dichotomized at below the 10th percentile or above the 90th percentile cut-off points derived from the control biomarker distributions (logistic regression) or continuous measures (tobit regression).   results and conclusion af volume for 331 cases and 698 controls was sufficient for luminex analysis. including all individuals in the cohort yielded no significant differences in chemokine levels in cases versus controls. logistic regression analyses, performed on individuals diagnosed using icd-10 only, showed increased risk for asd with elevated mcp-1 (elevated 90th percentile adjusted or: 2.32 [95% ci: 1.17-4.61]) compared to controls. an increased risk for infantile autism with elevated mcp-1 was also found (adjusted or: 2.28 [95% ci: 1.16-4.48]). elevated levels of mcp-1 may decipher an etiologic immunologic dysfunction or play rather an indirect role in the pathophysiology of asd. further studies to confirm its role and to identify the potential pathways through which mcp-1 may contribute to the development of asd are necessary. background the danish medical birth registry (mbr) was established in 1968 and has been computerized since 1973. the primary purpose of the registration is to monitor the health of the newborns and of the quality of the antenatal and delivery care services, but the registry is increasingly being used in research. major changes in registration have taken place in 1978 and 1991. the paper describes the content and usage of the mbr over time and suggests research topics for the future.   results a broad scope of studies illustrates how the mbr has been used, either as single data source, linked with data from other registries or with data from interviews or self-completed questionnaires. validations have shown variations in the quality of data, depending on source, and have underlined the need for constant quality control. any access to data at the individual level is subjected to special provisions laid down by the data surveillance authority and also requires a permission from the national board of health.   conclusions the time from conception to early childhood is an important period concerning future health for the individual. the danish medical birth registry is a valuable tool in this respect, which has not yet been used to its full potential in research or monitoring. experience indicates that the quality of the registry depends upon having a close link to the staff responsible for delivery services and thus having the necessary specialised skills and interest.
rna interference (rnai) has been developed as a powerful technique in the research of functional genomics as well as plant pest control. in this report, double-stranded rnas (dsrna) targeting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase (hmgr) gene, which catalyze a rate-limiting enzymatic reaction in the mevalonate pathway of juvenile hormone (jh) synthesis in cotton bollworm, was expressed in cotton plants via agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. pcr and sothern analysis revealed the integration of hmgr gene into cotton genome. rt-pcr and qrt-pcr confirmed the high transcription level of dshmgr in transgenic cotton lines. the hmgr expression both in transcription and translation level was significantly downregulated in cotton bollworms (helicoverpa armigera) larvae after feeding on the leaves of hmgr transgenic plants. the transcription level of hmgr gene in larvae reared on transgenic cotton leaves was as much as 80.68% lower than that of wild type. in addition, the relative expression level of vitellogenin (vg, crucial source of nourishment for offspring embryo development) gene was also reduced by 76.86% when the insect larvae were fed with transgenic leaves. the result of insect bioassays showed that the transgenic plant harboring dshmgr not only inhibited net weight gain but also delayed the growth of cotton bollworm larvae. taken together, transgenic cotton plant expressing dsrnas successfully downregulated hmgr gene and impaired the development and survival of target insect, which provided more option for plant pest control. abstract transgenic maize, zea mays l., event tc1507 produces the cry1f protein to provide protection from feeding by several important lepidopteran pests, including spodoptera frugiperda (j.e. smith) (lepidoptera: noctuidae). reports of reduced field performance against this species in puerto rico were investigated, and laboratory bioassays showed that s. frugiperda collected from the affected area exhibited lower sensitivity to the cry1f protein compared with typical colonies from other regions. the resistance was shown to be autosomally inherited and highly recessive. the puerto rico colony was shown to be moderately less sensitive than susceptible laboratory strains to cry1ab and cry1ac, but the differences in sensitivity were dramatically smaller than for cry1f. potential contributory factors to the emergence of resistance to cry1f in puerto rico populations of s. frugiperda include the tropical island geography, unusually large population sizes in 2006, and drought conditions reducing the availability of alternative hosts. in response to this resistance incident, the technology providers have stopped commercial sales of tc1507 maize in puerto rico pending potential reversion to susceptibility.
bovine somatotropin (bst) increases milk production in dairy animals. the maximum increase in milk production has been observed up to 41%. somatotropin did not change milk composition significantly . during short-term application of bst, cows mobilized their body-reserves to support the increased milk production. although dm intake of cows was increased in the long-term applications, however, gross efficiency of production was improved due to larger increase in milk production than dm intake. somatotropin did not adversely affect the health and reproductive performance of the cows. repartitioning of nutrients in body-tissue was primarily responsible for the increase in milk-production but defining the exact mechanism by which bst exerted its effect still requires additional research. the galactopoietic effect of daily injections, for five day periods, of growth hormone was examined by measuring milk yield, mammary blood flow and arteriovenous differences of glucose and amino acids on 12 occasions in four goats. in 10 periods there were marked increases (mean 18.1%) in mammary blood flow (8 statistically significant) and less-marked increases (mean 8.0%) in milk yield (6 statistically significant). on 8 of the occasions on which it was measured the maximum blood plasma growth hormone concentration was increased to more than 8 ng/ml. there were no statistically significant changes in mammary arteriovenous concentration differences of glucose or amino acids in response to growth hormone injections. it is suggested that, contrary to the usual situation in which the rate of mammary blood flow appears to be regulated by the metabolic activity of the gland, the galactopoietic response to growth hormone may be a consequence of elevated blood flow, which increases the supply to the gland of rate-limiting metabolic substrates.
gabab receptors are the g-protein-coupled receptors for gaba, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. two receptor subtypes, gabab(1a,2) and gabab(1b,2), are formed by the assembly of gabab1a and gabab1b subunits with gabab2 subunits. the gabab1b subunit is a shorter isoform of the gabab1a subunit lacking two n-terminal protein interaction motifs, the sushi domains. selectively gabab1a protein traffics into the axons of glutamatergic neurons, whereas both the gabab1a and gabab1b proteins traffic into the dendrites. the mechanism(s) and targeting signal(s) responsible for the selective trafficking of gabab1a protein into axons are unknown. here, we provide evidence that the sushi domains are axonal targeting signals that redirect gabab1a protein from its default dendritic localization to axons. specifically, we show that mutations in the sushi domains preventing protein interactions preclude axonal localization of gabab1a. when fused to cd8α, the sushi domains polarize this uniformly distributed protein to axons. likewise, when fused to mglur1a the sushi domains redirect this somatodendritic protein to axons, showing that the sushi domains can override dendritic targeting information in a heterologous protein. cell surface expression of the sushi domains is not required for axonal localization of gabab1a. altogether, our findings are consistent with the sushi domains functioning as axonal targeting signals by interacting with axonally bound proteins along intracellular sorting pathways. our data provide a mechanistic explanation for the selective trafficking of gabab(1a,2) receptors into axons while at the same time identifying a well defined axonal delivery module that can be used as an experimental tool. little is known about presynaptic assembly during central nervous system synaptogenesis. here we used time-lapse fluorescence imaging, immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy to study hippocampal neuronal cultures transfected with a fusion construct of the presynaptic vesicle protein vamp and green fluorescent protein. our results suggest that major cytoplasmic and membrane-associated protein precursors of the presynaptic active zone are transported along developing axons together as discrete packets. retrospective electron microscopy demonstrated varied vesicular and tubulovesicular membrane structures. packets containing these heterogeneous structures were stabilized specifically at new sites of dendrite- and axon-initiated cell–cell contact; within less than one hour, evoked vesicle recycling was observed at these putative nascent synapses. these observations suggest that substantial membrane remodeling may be necessary to produce the uniform vesicles typical of the mature active zone, and that many presynaptic proteins may be united early in their biogenesis and sorting pathways.
craving is a hallmark of drug dependence, including dependence on nicotine. many studies have examined the neural substrates of cravings elicited by smoking-related cues. less is known about the neural basis of unprovoked, abstinence-induced cravings, despite the contributions of such cravings to smoking relapse. to fill this gap, we used arterial spin labeled (asl) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging to characterize the neural substrates of abstinence-induced cravings to smoke. fifteen chronic smokers were scanned during a resting state on two separate occasions: (1) smoking satiety and (2) abstinence (after ≥12 h of smoking deprivation), in counterbalanced order. smoking abstinence state (vs satiety) was associated with increased cerebral blood flow (cbf) in anterior cingulate cortex (acc)/medial orbitofrontal cortex (ofc) and left ofc. abstinence-induced cravings to smoke were predicted by cbf increases (abstinence minus satiety) in the right ofc, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, occipital cortex, acc, ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens, thalamus, amygdala, bilateral hippocampus, left caudate, and right insula. these data suggest that increased activation in the brain's visuospatial and reward circuitry underlies abstinence-induced cravings to smoke, and thereby, may be important in relapse. most advances in addiction treatment to date have addressed the physical dependence and withdrawal that accompany addiction to some drugs of abuse. in contrast, it has proven more difficult to develop medications that effectively treat drug craving and relapse, the core features of addictive disorders. current efforts focus on developing medications that prevent a drug from getting to its protein target, that mimic drug action and thereby partially alleviate drug craving, or that affect the addiction process per se. the latter approach is the most speculative, but also the most promising in terms of translating basic knowledge of addiction into clinical progress.
porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv-2) has been associated with syndromes grouped by the term porcine circovirus associated diseases (pcvad). the pcv-2 isolates have been grouped into two major groups or genotypes according to their nucleotide sequence of whole genomes and/or orf-2: pcv-2b, which have, in turn, been subdivided into three clusters (1a–1c), and pcv-2a, which has been subdivided into five clusters (2a–2e). in the present study, we obtained 16 sequences of pcv-2 from different farms from 2003 to 2008, from animals with confirmatory diagnosis of pcvad. since results showed an identity of 99.8% among them, they were grouped within a common cluster 1a-b. this preliminary study suggests a stable circulation of pcv-2b among the argentinean pig population. neonatal gnotobiotic piglets were inoculated with tissue homogenates and low- and high-passage cell culture material to determine if the lesions of the newly described porcine postweaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome (pmws) could be reproduced. for this, 17 3-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were inoculated intranasally with pelleted chloroform-treated, filtered extracts from cell cultures, filter-sterilized homogenates of lymphoid tissue from pmws-affected piglets, or control materials. piglets were maintained in germ-free isolators for up to 5 weeks after infection prior to euthanasia and collection of samples for analysis. all piglets inoculated with the viral inocula developed lesions typical of pmws, including generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, nephritis, interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, and gastritis. porcine circovirus (pcv), as well as porcine parvovirus (ppv), was detected in tissues by virus reisolation, polymerase chain reaction analysis, or immunohistochemistry. all infected piglets developed moderate to high titers of antibody to pcv and moderate titers to ppv. no lesions, virus, or virus-specific antibodies were detected in sham-inoculated or uninoculated control piglets. these studies demonstrate that the lesions of pmws can be experimentally reproduced in gnotobiotic piglets using filterable viral agents derived from pigs with pmws and provide an experimental basis for further investigation into the pathogenesis and control of this emerging infectious disease in swine.
the ‘impassable’ eastern pacific barrier (epb), ca 5000 km of deep water separating the eastern from the central pacific, is the world's widest marine biogeographic barrier. sequencing of mitochondrial dna in 20 reef fish morphospecies encountered on both sides of the barrier revealed cryptic speciation in two. among the other 18 species only two showed significant differentiation (as revealed by haplotype networks and fst statistics) between the eastern and the central pacific. coalescence analyses indicated that genetic similarity in the 18 truly transpacific species resulted from different combinations of ages of most recent invasion and of levels of recurrent gene flow, with estimated times of initial separation ranging from approximately 30 000 to 1 myr (ago). there is no suggestion of simultaneous interruptions of gene flow among the species. migration across the epb was previously thought to be exclusively eastward, but our evidence showed two invasions from east to west and eight cases in which subsequent gene flow possibly proceeded in the same direction. thus, the epb is sporadically permeable to propagules originating on either side. intraspecific gene evolution cannot always be represented by a bifurcating tree. rather, population genealogies are often multifurcated, descendant genes coexist with persistent ancestors and recombination events produce reticulate relationships. whereas traditional phylogenetic methods assume bifurcating trees, several networking approaches have recently been developed to estimate intraspecific genealogies that take into account these population-level phenomena.
cell death induced by agents that disrupt microtubules can kill cells by inducing a prolonged mitotic block. this mitotic block is dependent on the spindle assembly checkpoint, a surveillance system that ensures the bipolar attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle before the onset of anaphase. under some conditions, the spindle assembly checkpoint can become weakened, allowing cells to exit mitosis despite the presence of chromosomes that are not properly attached to the mitotic spindle. here, we use an aurora kinase inhibitor to drive mitotic exit and test the effect of mitotic arrest length on death in the subsequent interphase. cells that are blocked in mitosis for >15 h die shortly after exiting from mitosis, whereas cells that exit after being blocked for <15 h show variable fates, with some living for days after exiting mitosis. cells blocked in mitosis by either taxol or epothilone b are acutely sensitive to the death ligand tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, suggesting that prolonged mitosis allows the gradual accumulation of internal death signals, rendering cells hypersensitive to additional prodeath cues. death under these conditions is initiated while cyclin b1 is still present, indicating that cells are in mitosis. our experiments suggest that there is a point of no return during prolonged mitotic block after which mitotic exit can no longer block death. [mol cancer ther 2009;8(6):1646–54] the spindle checkpoint that monitors kinetochore–microtubule attachment has been implicated in tumorigenesis; however, the relation between the spindle checkpoint and cell death remains obscure. in bub1-deficient (but not mad2-deficient) cells, conditions that activate the spindle checkpoint (i.e., cold shock or treatment with nocodazole, paclitaxel, or 17-aag) induced dna fragmentation during early mitosis. this mitotic cell death was independent of caspase activation; therefore, we named it caspase-independent mitotic death (cimd). cimd depends on p73, a homologue of p53, but not on p53. cimd also depends on apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease g, which are effectors of caspase-independent cell death. treatment with nocodazole, paclitaxel, or 17-aag induced cimd in cell lines derived from colon tumors with chromosome instability, but not in cells from colon tumors with microsatellite instability. this result was due to low bub1 expression in the former cell lines. when bub1 is completely depleted, aneuploidy rather than cimd occurs. these results suggest that cells prone to substantial chromosome missegregation might be eliminated via cimd.
abstract interaction of na/k-atpase with its ligand ouabain has been implicated in the regulation of various biological processes. the objective was to investigate roles of na/k-atpase isoforms in formation and function of junctional complexes in sertoli cells. primary cultures of sertoli cells were obtained by enzymatic digestion of 20-day-old rat testes and grown on matrigel-coated dishes for 7 days. sertoli cells predominantly expressed the ubiquitous isoform of na/k-atpase (atp1a1), confirmed by immunoblotting, pcr, immunofluorescence, and mass spectrometry. treatment of sertoli cells with 50 nm ouabain increased transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) and expression of claudin 11 (tight junctions) and connexin 43 (gap junctions), whereas 1 mm ouabain had opposite effects. involvement of src-egfr-erk1/2-creb pathway in ouabain-mediated expression of claudin 11 and connexin 43 was evaluated. incubation of sertoli cells with 50 nm ouabain increased content of p-src, p-egfr, p-erk1/2, and p-creb; in contrast, 1 mm ouabain decreased phosphorylation of these signalingmolecules. preincubation of sertoli cells with inhibitors of src andmapk pathways inhibited ouabain-induced effects on these signaling molecules, ter, and expression of claudin 11 and connexin 43. in conclusion, we inferred that atp1a1 regulated sertoli cell tight junctions and gap junctions through the src-egfr-erk1/2-creb pathway. ouabain is an endogenous steroid; therefore, its interaction with atp1a1 may be a critical signaling mechanism for the regulation of sertoli cell function and male fertility. summary sentence the atp1a1-src-egfr-erk1/2-creb pathway regulates expression of connexin 43 and claudin 11 in rat sertoli cells; consequently, it is involved in formation and function of junctional complexes. in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (adpkd), cyst formation and enlargement require proliferation of mural renal epithelial cells and the transepithelial secretion of fluid into the cyst cavity. na,k-atpase is essential for solute and water transport in adpkd cells, and ouabain blocks fluid secretion in these cells. by binding to the na,k-atpase, ouabain also induces proliferation in some cell types. surprisingly, it was found that nanomolar concentrations of ouabain, similar to those circulating in blood, induced adpkd cell proliferation but had no statistically significant effect on normal human kidney (nhk) cells. ouabain, acting from the basolateral side of the cells, also caused an increase in the level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erk). mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (mek) inhibitor u0126 blocked ouabain-induced erk activation and cell proliferation, suggesting that ouabain effect is mediated through the mek-erk pathway. in contrast to nhk cells, the dose-response curve for ouabain inhibition of na,k-atpase activity indicated that approximately 20% of the enzyme in adpkd cells exhibits a higher affinity for ouabain. the increased ouabain affinity of adpkd cells was not due to differences in na,k-atpase isoform expression because these cells, like nhk cells, possess only the alpha1 and beta1 subunits. the gamma variants of the na,k-atpase also are expressed in the cells but are elevated in adpkd cells. currently, the basis for the differences in ouabain sensitivity of nhk and adpkd cells is unknown. it is concluded that ouabain stimulates proliferation in adpkd cells by binding to the na,k-atpase with high affinity and via activation of the mek-erk pathway.
aims/hypothesiscardiovascular and renal diseases share common risk factors. we used structural equation modelling (sem) to evaluate the independent and combined effects of phenotypes and genotypes implicated in cardiovascular diseases on renal function in type 2 diabetes.methods1,188 type 2 diabetic patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups according to bimodal distributions of the logarithmically transformed (loge) urinary albumin:creatinine ratio and plasma creatinine levels. models for these groups, comprising continuous and non-ranking categorical data, were developed separately to evaluate the inter-relationships among measured variables and latent factors using non-linear sems, bayesian estimation and model selection as assessed by a goodness-of-fit statistic.resultsinter-correlated measured variables (obesity, glycaemia, lipid, blood pressure) and variants of the genes encoding endothelial nitric oxide synthase (nos), β-adrenergic receptor (adrb), components of the renin–angiotensin system (ras) and lipid metabolism were loaded onto their respective latent factors of phenotypes and genotypes. in addition to direct and indirect effects, latent factors of obesity, lipid and bp interacted with latent factors of adrb and ras genotypes to influence renal function. together with variants of the genes encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, atrial natriuretic peptide, adducin, g protein β3 subunit, epithelial sodium channel α subunit and matrix metallopeptidase 3, these parameters explained 39–80% of the variance in renal function in the high-risk and low-risk models.conclusions/interpretationsem is a useful tool for confirming and quantifying multiple interactions of biological pathways with genetic determinants. the combined and interactive effects of blood pressure, lipid and obesity on renal function may have therapeutic implications, especially in type 2 diabetic individuals with genetic risk factors. cytokine‐induced inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (dm). we investigated plasma concentrations and ex vivo production of cytokines and chemokines, and intracellular signalling molecules, mitogen‐activated protein kinases (mapk) in t helper (th) cells and monocytes in 94 type 2 diabetic patients with or without nephropathy and 20 healthy controls. plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (tnf)‐α, interleukin (il)‐6, il‐18 and chemokine ccl2 in patients with diabetic nephropathy (dn) were significantly higher than control subjects, while il‐10, cxcl8, cxcl9, cxcl10 and adiponectin concentrations of dn were significantly higher than patients without diabetic nephropathy (ndn) and control subjects (all p < 0·05). plasma concentrations of tnf‐α, il‐6, il‐10, il‐18, ccl2, cxcl8, cxcl9, cxcl10 and adiponectin exhibited significant positive correlation with urine albumin : creatinine ratio in dn patients. the percentage increases of ex vivo production of il‐6, cxcl8, cxcl10, ccl2 and ccl5 upon tnf‐α activation were significantly higher in both ndn and dn patients than controls (all p < 0·05). the percentage increases in il‐18‐induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (erk) in th cells of ndn and dn were significantly higher than controls (p < 0·05), while the percentage increase in tnf‐α‐induced phosphorylation of p38 mapk in monocytes and il‐18‐induced phosphorylation of p38 mapk in th cells and monocytes were significantly higher in ndn patients than controls. these results confirmed that the aberrant production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and differential activation of mapk in different leucocytes are the underlying immunopathological mechanisms of type 2 dm patients with dn.
background: modern implant systems used in the cervical region do not allow for the ingrowth of peri-implant mucosa. the aim of the present study was to use a laser to modify titanium implants used in that region in order to promote mucosa ingrowth, thereby creating a biological barrier against bacterial infection. methods: a krf-excimer laser (λ=248 nm) was used (τ=30 ns, fmax=50 hz, emax=1.2 j). craters were generated, under normal atmospheric conditions or in vacuum, in the polished regions of 18 frialit 2 implants. surface analysis was performed using a scanning electron microscope, an energy dispersive x-ray technique, and profile analysis. results: by adjusting the parameters used, it was possible to create canals with widths of up to 100 μm and depths of 450 μm. canal morphology was influenced by the laser energy and the surrounding atmospheric conditions. irradiation with 3,000 pulses (650 mj per pulse) resulted in rough surfaces under normal atmospheric conditions, whereas these parameters resulted in smooth surfaces in vacuum. the surface chemistry was also influenced by the laser parameters used. conclusion: laser-assisted modification of titanium surfaces permits fabrication of 3-d surface modifications. the surface chemistry can also be influenced, depending upon the parameters chosen. further studies are necessary to evaluate whether ingrowth of mucosa into the canals can be realized. purpose titanium endosseous implants are becoming increasingly important in dentistry because of their excellent long-term results. however, it has been reported that these implants may lead to higher concentrations of titanium, especially in the lungs and kidneys. the purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine whether co2 laser-assisted decontamination of exposed implant surfaces is associated with an increase in titanium release.   materials and methods in 6 beagle dogs, a total of 60 implants were placed. after osseointegration and second-stage surgery, peri-implantitis was induced by cotton floss ligatures for 12 weeks. surgical treatment consisted of granulation tissue removal, including decontamination of the implant surface with 3 different methods. twenty implants were decontaminated conventionally by an air-powder abrasive for 60 seconds. another 20 implants were decontaminated by laser treatment alone. the last 20 implants were treated conventionally by air-powder abrasive and then lased. four months later, fresh tissue samples of various tissues were evaluated by histologic and chemical analysis.   results quantitative analysis indicated that titanium accumulation could be detected, especially in the spleen, liver, oral mucosa, regional lymph nodes, lung, and kidney in the beagle dog model.   discussion the concentrations found did not exceed those previously reported in the literature.   conclusion these results support the hypothesis that co2 laser-assisted therapy of ailing implants will not result in excessive titanium concentrations in tissues. accordingly, co2 lasers appear suitable and safe for peri-implant gingival surgery.
advances in basic retinal anatomy, genetics, biochemical pathways and neurochemistry have not only provided a better understanding of retinal function but have also allowed us to link basic science to retinal disease. the link with disease allowed measures to be developed that now provide an opportunity to intervene and slow down or even restore sight in previously ‘untreatable’ retinal diseases. one of the critical advances has been the understanding of the retinal amino acid neurotransmitters, related amino acids, their metabolites and functional receptors. this review provides an overview of amino acid localisation in the retina and examples of how retinal anatomy and amino acid neurochemistry directly links to understanding retinal disease. also, the implications of retinal remodelling involving amino acid (glutamate) receptors are outlined in this review and insights are presented on how understanding of detrimental and beneficial retinal remodelling will provide better outcomes for patients using strategies for the preservation or restoration of vision. an internet‐based database of retinal images of amino acid labelling patterns and other amino acid‐related images in health and disease is located at http://www.aminoacidimmunoreactivity.com. excitation mapping is a method of visualizing the signaling history of neurons with permeant organic cations. it is compatible with high-resolution imaging, allowing concurrent visualization of all neuronal classes and their glutamate-gated excitation histories. excitation mapping documents the stability and precision of neuronal signaling within a given neuronal class, arguing that single unit electrophysiological sampling accurately reflects neuronal diversity. we here review the theory of excitation mapping, provide methods and protocol links; outline imaging concepts; provide parametric data on the temporal range and physiological sensitivity of excitation mapping; and show that immunocytochemical methods for macromolecules are compatible with excitation mapping.
objectives the aim of this study was to assess whether endogenous accumulation of adenosine, induced by low-dose dipyridamole infusion, protects from exercise-induced ischemia.   background adenosine is a recognized mediator of ischemic preconditioning in experimental settings.   methods ten patients (all men: mean age 63.4 +/- 7.3 years) with chronic stable angina, angiographically assessed coronary artery disease (n = 7) or previous myocardial infarction (n = 3) and exercise-induced ischemia underwent on different days two exercise-stress echo tests after premedication with placebo or dipyridamole (15 mg in 30 min, stopped 5 min before testing) in a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized crossover design.   results in comparison with placebo, dipyridamole less frequently induced chest pain (20% vs. 100%, p = 0.001) and >0.1 mv st segment depression (50% vs. 100%, p < 0.05). wall motion abnormalities during exercise-stress test were less frequent (placebo = 100% vs. dipyridamole = 70%, p = ns) and significantly less severe (wall motion score index at peak stress: placebo = 1.55 +/- 0.17 vs. dipyridamole = 1.27 +/- 0.2, p < 0.01) following dipyridamole, which also determined an increase in exercise time up to echocardiographic positivity (placebo = 385.9 +/- 51.4 vs. dipyridamole = 594.4 +/- 156.9 s, p < 0.01).   conclusions low-dose dipyridamole infusion increases exercise tolerance in chronic stable angina, possibly by endogenous adenosine accumulation acting on high affinity a1 myocardial receptors involved in preconditioning or positively modulating coronary flow through collaterals. background coronary steal is defined as a fall in blood flow toward a certain vascular region in favor of another area during arteriolar vasodilatation, ie, a coronary flow velocity reserve (cfvr) <1. the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of steal in patients with a wide range of collateral supply to a vascular area of interest and to assess whether steal is associated with the amount of collateral flow.   methods and results one hundred patients 57+/-9 years old with a coronary artery stenosis to be dilated were examined with intracoronary (ic) doppler guidewires. ic adenosine-induced cfvr<1 obtained distal to the stenosis was defined as steal. an index for collateral flow was determined by positioning the doppler guidewire in the collateral-dependent vessel distal to the stenosis and measuring the flow velocity time integral during (vi(occl), cm) and after (vi(ø-occl)) balloon occlusion. vi(occl)/vi(ø-occl) was determined without and with intravenous adenosine (140 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)). coronary steal occurred in 10 of 100 patients. patients with steal showed superior collaterals compared with those without steal: vi(occl)/vi(ø-occl)=0.65+/-0.24 in patients with steal versus 0.29+/-0.18 in those without steal (p=.0001). in all patients with steal, there was a reduction in collateral flow during intravenous adenosine-induced hyperemia, whereas in the majority (70%) of patients without steal, collateral flow increased or remained unchanged during hyperemia.   conclusions coronary steal assessed by intracoronary doppler flow velocity measurements occurs in 10% of patients with a wide range of coronary collaterals to the vascular area from which blood flow is redistributed. there is a direct association between the presence of steal away from and the amount of collateral flow toward the region under investigation. collateral flow to the vascular region studied decreases during adenosine-induced hyperemia, which indicates a mechanism of steal via the extensive collaterals.
background the public health cost impact of complex regional pain syndrome type i (crps i) is considerable in both emergency and scheduled orthopaedic surgery. we proposed to assess the effectiveness of vitamin c in prevention of crps i in foot and ankle surgery.   methods we carried out a "before-after" quasi-experimental study comparing two chronologically successive groups without (group i: july 2002-june 2003) and with (group ii: july 2003-june 2004) preventive 1g daily vitamin c treatment. all patients having surgery on the foot or ankle were enrolled, with the exception of diabetic foot cases. several factors were analysed: sex, age, type of pathology, history of crps i, psychological context, tourniquet time, and cast immobilisation time.   results 420 feet (392 patients) were included in the study: 185 in group i, 235 in group ii. crps i occurred in 18 cases in group i (9.6%) and 4 cases in group ii (1.7%) (p<10(-4)), with history of crps i as a significantly correlated factor (relative risk=10.4). the psychological context (anxio-depressive state) showed a (sub-significant) tendency to increase the risk of crps i (relative risk=2.6).   conclusion vitamin c has been shown to be effective in preventing crps i secondary to wrist fracture, but few data are available with respect to foot and ankle cases. the present study demonstrates the effectiveness of vitamin c in preventing crps i of the foot and ankle-a frequent complication in our control group (9.6%). the authors recommend preventive management by vitamin c. this is a multisite study examining the internal validity and comprehensiveness of the international association for the study of pain (iasp) diagnostic criteria for complex regional pain syndrome (crps). a standardized sign/symptom checklist was used in patient evaluations to obtain data on crps-related signs and symptoms in a series of 123 patients meeting iasp criteria for crps. principal components factor analysis (pca) was used to detect statistical groupings of signs/symptoms (factors). crps signs and symptoms grouped together statistically in a manner somewhat different than in current iasp/crps criteria. as in current criteria, a separate pain/sensation criterion was supported. however, unlike in current criteria, pca indicated that vasomotor symptoms form a factor distinct from a sudomotor/edema factor. changes in range of motion, motor dysfunction, and trophic changes, which are not included in the iasp criteria, formed a distinct fourth factor. scores on the pain/sensation factor correlated positively with pain duration (p , 0:001), but there was a negative correlation between the sudomotor/edema factor scores and pain duration (p , 0:05). the motor/trophic factor predicted positive responses to sympathetic block (p , 0:05). these results suggest that the internal validity of the iasp/crps criteria could be improved by separating vasomotor signs/symptoms (e.g. temperature and skin color asymmetry) from those re ̄ecting sudomotor dysfunction (e.g. sweating changes) and edema. results also indicate motor and trophic changes may be an important and distinct component of crps which is not currently incorporated in the iasp criteria. an experimental revision of crps diagnostic criteria for research purposes is proposed. implications for diagnostic sensitivity and speci®city are discussed. q 1999 international association for the study of pain. published by elsevier science b.v.
the mhc class i dk molecule supplies vital host resistance during murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) infection. natural killer (nk) cells expressing the ly49g2 inhibitory receptor, which specifically binds dk, are required to control viral spread. the extent of dk-dependent host resistance, however, differs significantly amongst related strains of mice, c57l and ma/my. as a result, we predicted that relatively small-effect modifier genetic loci might together shape immune cell features, nk cell reactivity, and the host immune response to mcmv. a robust dk-dependent genetic effect, however, has so far hindered attempts to identify additional host resistance factors. thus, we applied genomic mapping strategies and multicolor flow cytometric analysis of immune cells in naive and virus-infected hosts to identify genetic modifiers of the host immune response to mcmv. we discovered and validated many quantitative trait loci (qtl); these were mapped to at least 19 positions on 16 chromosomes. intriguingly, one newly discovered non-mhc locus (cmv5) controlled splenic nk cell accrual, secondary lymphoid organ structure, and lymphoid follicle development during mcmv infection. we infer that cmv5 aids host resistance to mcmv infection by expanding nk cells needed to preserve and protect essential tissue structural elements, to enhance lymphoid remodeling and to increase viral clearance in spleen. the goal of most vaccines is the induction of long-lived memory t and b cells capable of protecting the host from infection by cytotoxic mechanisms, cytokines and high-affinity antibodies. however, efforts to develop vaccines against major human pathogens like hiv and hcv have not been successful, thereby highlighting the need for novel approaches to circumvent immunoregulatory mechanisms that limit induction of protective immunity. here we show that mouse natural killer (nk) cells inhibit generation of long-lived virus-specific memory t- and b-cells as well as virus-specific antibody production after acute infection. mechanistically, nk cells suppressed cd4 t cells and follicular helper t cells (tfh) in a perforin-dependent manner during the first few days of infection, resulting in a weaker germinal center (gc) response and diminished immune memory. we anticipate that innovative strategies to relieve nk cell-mediated suppression of immunity should facilitate development of efficacious new vaccines targeting difficult-to-prevent infections.
the lesion showed great amount of hyperdense foci that caused enlargement and disruption of the buccal cortical bone and measured 2.0 cm (fig. 2). calcifying cystic odontogenic tumor, ossifying fibroma and adenomatoid odontogenic tumor were the hypotheses of diagnosis. thus, under local anesthesia, the lesion was excised and sent for histopathological analysis. the macroscopic examination showed a round and brownish soft tissue with a smooth surface. the lesion was sectioned and several yellowish granules with hard consistency were observed (fig. 3). microscopically, a cavity lined by the non-keratinized, hyperplastic and squamous epithelium was observed. the fibrous capsule had a moderate chronic inflammatory reaction and extensive calcifications, which were also noted in the cystic lumen and epithelial lining. these calcifications the radicular cyst is an inflammatory odontogenic cyst of endodontic origin. radiographically, the lesion appears as a periapical radiolucent image. this report describes a very rare case of a mixed periapical radiographic image diagnosed as a radicular cyst. a 37-year-old female patient presented a mixed, well-circumscribed image located in the periapical region of the left maxillary central incisor, which presented unsatisfactory endodontic treatment. microscopic examination revealed a cavity lined by non-keratinized squamous epithelium and extensive calcifications in the cystic lumen and lining epithelium. diagnosis of radicular cyst with extensive calcifications was established. endodontic retreatment was performed and no radiographic signs of recurrence were observed 18 months after treatment. although very rare, a radicular cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a mixed periapical image associated to teeth with pulp necrosis. m i x e d p e r i a p i c a l l e s i o n : an a typ i c a l r ad i c u l a r cy s t with extensive calc i f icat ions objective the aim of this study was to report the clinicopathologic and radiologic features of 143 benign fibro-osseous lesions (bfols).   study design clinical and radiologic information were retrieved from the patients files, and histologic features were reviewed from hematoxylin and eosin-stained histologic slides.   results there were 22 ossifying fibromas (ofs), 21 fibrous dysplasias (fds) and 100 osseous dysplasias (ods; 65 florid, 18 focal, and 17 periapical). the mean age of the fd/of patients was a decade lower than those with od. the mandible was more affected than the maxilla, except in fds. all fds and ofs presented local swelling, whereas this was observed in <40% of the ods. radiologic images of the florid/periapical ods and ofs were predominantly mixed, whereas fds and focal ods were predominantly radiopaque.   conclusions florid od, of, and fd were the most common diagnoses, and the clinicopathologic and radiologic features were somewhat distinct from the characteristics of other populations.
a 29-yr-old man, presented with abdominal pain and fever, had an initial computed tomography (ct) scan revealing low attenuation of both adrenal glands. the initial concern was for tuberculous adrenalitis or autoimmune adrenalitis combined with adrenal hemorrhage. the patient started empirical anti-tuberculous medication, but there was no improvement. enlargement of cervical lymph nodes were developed after that and excisional biopsy of cervical lymph nodes was performed. pathological finding of excised lymph nodes was compatible to nk/t-cell lymphoma. the patient died due to the progression of the disease even after undergoing therapeutic trials including chemotherapy. lymphoma mainly involving adrenal gland in the early stage of the disease is rare and the vast majority of cases that have been reported were of b-cell origin. from this case it is suggested that extra-nodal nk/t-cell lymphoma should be considered as a cause of bilateral adrenal masses although it is rare. primary adrenal lymphoma (pal) is an extremely rare entity and adrenal insufficiency is a common complication. bilateral enlargement of adrenal glands should raise the suspicion of lymphoma, especially in patients with clinical or laboratory features of adrenal insufficiency. most of these cases are highly aggressive tumors and should be treated with multiagent chemotherapy. the role of bilateral adrenalectomy and/or radiotherapy cannot be estimated. our patient with pal was an 80-year-old man who presented with clinical and laboratory features of adrenal insufficiency. combination chemotherapy plus rituximab was unsuccessful and our patient died from progressive disease.
in this study, measurements of the trace metals zn, cd, cr, ni, pb, cu, fe and al were performed on 53 wet atmospheric precipitation samples (snow and rainwater) collected at a central site of tehran. samples were collected using a bulk sampler equipped with a high-density polyethylene funnel from november to may in 2011 and 2012 on the roof of a building in the city centre. trace metals in the filtered samples were measured with icp-ms. statistical analysis of the results revealed that al, which is principally a crustal-derived element, was the highest mean measured concentration. the ph ranged from 4.2 to 7.1 with a mean value of 5.1. crustal enrichment factors (efc) related to the relative abundance of elements in crustal material was calculated using al as reference crustal. efc calculations indicated that samples were not enriched with fe and cr but were, fairly to extremely, enriched with zn, cd, ni, pb and cu. factor component analysis with varimax-normalized rotation was conducted to find the probable sources of the measured species. this resulted in two factors with eigenvalues greater than unity. factor 1 showed an anthropogenic source, mostly industrial combustion and local traffic emissions, for zn, cd, ni, pb, and cu while factor 2 showed a crustal contribution for al, fe and cr. the horizontal distribution and levels of heavy metals in the biggest snowstorm in shenyang since 1904 were investigated by analyzing 4 metals (as, cd, pb, and cu) in a series of ultraclean samples collected from 17 sites distributed in different regions of the shenyang area, china. the results showed that the concentrations of all the 4 heavy metals in snow from the industrial regions were high, up to 7.3 (as), 2.2 (cd), 850.0 (pb), and 0.197-20.2 (cu) microg/kg, respectively. in the suburb, in contrast, their concentrations were not detected, except for as. because of the long-term application of arsenical pesticides and herbicides, as was detected in the snow samples which collected on the farm. as, cd, and pb were also detected in the snow samples collected from the parks, the residential areas, and the commercial districts mainly by reason of human activities. in a sense, long-term industrial activities, traffic activities, coal combustion, and agricultural activities affected the horizontal distribution and levels of these heavy metals in snow differently. the data relating to the horizontal distribution and concentrations of heavy metals in the snow under extreme climatic conditions can provide with a unique snapshot of environmental pollution situation and behaviors in urban areas.
backgroundthe status of immunocompromised patients is well recognized in end stage renal disease (esrd). as described recently, this acquired immune dysfunction in the uremic milieu may be one of the main pathogenic factors for mortality in esrd. the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the immune response following a hepatitis b vaccination (hbv vaccination) and the survival of maintenance dialysis patients.methodsa total of 156 patients (103 on hemodialysis and 53 on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) were recruited. after receiving a full dose of the hbv vaccination, all patients were followed up for to 5 years to evaluate the association of patient survival, cause of mortality, and immune response.resultsthe response rate to the hepatitis b vaccination was 70.5%. there was no significant association between the immune response and the 5-year survival rate (p =0.600) or between the post-vaccination anti-hbs titers and the 5-year survival rate (p = 0.201). the logistic prediction model with the coefficient as non-response following hbv vaccination, diabetes mellitus, old age, and low albumin level could significantly predict infection-cause mortality (sensitivity = 0.842, specificity = 0.937).conclusionthere was no significant association between the immune response to hbv vaccination and the 5-year survival rate. however, non-response following hbv vaccination might be associated with infection-cause mortality in dialysis patients. cytokines affect nearly every biological process; these include embryonic development, disease pathogenesis, non‐specific response to infection, specific response to antigen, changes in cognitive functions and progression of the degenerative processes of aging. in addition, cytokines are part of stem cell differentiation, vaccine efficacy and allograft rejection. this short insight focuses on the milestones in cytokine biology and how the various and often contradictory activities of these small, non‐structural proteins affected the fields of inflammation and immunology. multiple biological properties or pleiotropism is the hallmark of a cytokine. today, the term “cytokine” encompasses interferons, the interleukins, the chemokine family, mesenchymal growth factors, the tumor necrosis factor family and adipokines. as of this writing, 33 cytokines are called interleukins, but many are part of families of related but distinct gene products. there are certainly over 100 separate genes coding for cytokine‐like activities, many with overlapping functions and many still unexplored. also discussed in this overview are the failures and successes of cytokines as therapeutic targets. a recent advance in the field has been that of differential cytokine production, which can be used to classify human disease as being “autoimmune” or “autoinflammatory” thus impacting on therapeutic interventions.
the sensitization of breast cancer stem cells (brcscs) to the inhibitive effects of radiotherapy through adjuvant therapy which targets oncogenic pathways represents a prospective strategy for improving the effect of radiation in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (tnbc). mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) activation is one of the most frequent events in human malignancies, and is critical for sustaining the self-renewing ability of cancer stem cells (cscs); inhibition by rapamycin is an effective and promising strategy in anticancer treatments. in the present study, we found that mtor activity was closely related to the self-renewal ability of brcscs, and in triple negative mda-mb-453 and mda-mb-468 cells, rapamycin repression of mtor phosphorylation decreased the number of mammospheres and helped to sensitize the resistant cscs to low-dose radiation therapy. by inhibiting mtor and mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (mnsod), we confirmed that rapamycin functioned through the mtor/mnsod/reactive oxygen species (ros) signaling pathway, and the existence of akt governed the rapamycin-induced asymmetric division (ad) of stem cells in cases of radiation-treated breast cancer. the synergic effects of rapamycin and low-dose radiation induced the ad of stem cells, which then resulted in a decrease in the number of mammospheres, and both were mediated by mnsod. governed by akt, the consequent inhibition of ros formation and oxidative stress preserved the ad mode of stem cells, which is critical for an improved radiotherapy response in clinical treatment, as the tumor group is thus easier to eliminate with radiation therapy. we posit that an in-depth understanding of the interaction of radiation with cscs has enormous potential and will make radiation even better and more effective. ionizing radiation triggers diverse responses in human cells encompassing apoptosis, necrosis, stress-induced premature senescence (sips), autophagy, and endopolyploidy (e.g., multinucleation). most of these responses result in loss of colony-forming ability in the clonogenic survival assay. however, not all modes of so-called clonogenic cell “death” are necessarily advantageous for therapeutic outcome in cancer radiotherapy. for example, the crosstalk between sips and autophagy is considered to influence the capacity of the tumor cells to maintain a prolonged state of growth inhibition that unfortunately can be succeeded by tumor regrowth and disease recurrence. likewise, endopolyploid giant cells are able to segregate into near diploid descendants that continue mitotic activities. herein we review the current knowledge on the roles that the p53 and p21waf1 tumor suppressors play in determining the fate of human fibroblasts (normal and li-fraumeni syndrome) and solid tumor-derived cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. in addition, we discuss the important role of wip1, a p53-regulated oncogene, in the temporal regulation of the dna damage response and its contribution to p53 dynamics post-irradiation. this article highlights the complexity of the dna damage response and provides an impetus for rethinking the nature of cancer cell resistance to therapeutic agents.
this study evaluates microcomputed tomography (micro-ct) as a method to obtain quantitative three-dimensional (3d) information on the arterial and venous vasculature of the mouse placenta. surface renderings at embryonic days (e) 13.5, 15.5, and 18.5 (full term) revealed that the arterial and venous vasculature branched within the chorionic plate whereas only the arterial vasculature deeply penetrated the placenta. umbilical vessel diameters measured by micro-ct did not significantly differ from those measured non-invasively in vivo by ultrasound biomicroscopy. variability in umbilical diameters, and surface area and volume measurements of arterial and venous vascular trees due to experimental error was low relative to biological variability, and significant inter-litter differences within gestational ages were detected. furthermore, umbilical vessel diameter increased significantly and incrementally to an arterial diameter of 0.631+/-0.009 mm and a venous diameter of 0.690+/-0.018 mm at e18.5. umbilical vein diameter was 3-9% greater than the artery, and both were significantly correlated with embryonic body weight (r> or =0.96). surface area and volume were determined for vessels greater than the minimum resolvable diameter of 0.03 mm which therefore excluded capillaries. arterial surface area and volume were unchanged from e13.5-15.5 but then more than doubled at e18.5 (to 170+/-13 mm(2) and 7.2+/-0.8mm(3), respectively). venous surface areas and volumes changed similarly with development although surface areas were lower than their arterial counterparts. we conclude that micro-ct has sufficient accuracy and precision to quantify late gestational changes in the 3d structure of the arterial and venous vasculature of the mouse placenta. the current understanding of the placental vascular tree largely derives from time-consuming morphometric analyses performed by conventional histology, electron microscopy of corrosion casts and three-dimensional reconstructions based on physical tissue sections. in the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that micro-computed tomography (micro-ct) emerges as a new, non-destructive and fast tool for imaging and quantifying fetoplacental vasculature. term placentae (n=5) were perfused with contrast agent consisting of barium-sulfate, gelatine and thymol shortly after caesarean-section-delivery. samples (1 cm(3)) from eight different regions of the placenta were subsequently scanned in a micro-ct. using tomographic reconstruction algorithms, three dimensional images were obtained by micro-ct allowing total stereoscopic visualization and continuous quantitative analysis of the vascular structure of the investigated samples. these samples were compared regarding vascular surface (vs) and vascular density (vascular volume fraction, tcvf). quantitative assessment showed an average vascular density of 16 per cent (sd+/-0.4) and a vascular surface of 475 mm(2)(sd+/-8) per total tissue volume (including intervillous space) of 125 mm(3). micro-ct image-analysis showed no significant differences in the fetal vascularization among term placentae. micro-ct imaging is feasible for imaging and analysis of the villous vascular tree, allows further morphologic studies and immunohistochemistry of the placental specimens and may emerge as an additional tool in the investigation of the physiology and pathophysiology of the placental vasculature.
self-renewal, differentiation, and tumorigenicity characterize cancer stem cells (cscs), which are rare and maintained by specific cell fate regulators. cscs are isolated from glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) and may be responsible for the lethality of incurable brain tumors. brain cscs may arise from the transformation of undifferentiated, nestin-positive neural stem or progenitor cells and gfap-expressing astrocytes. here, we report a role of nanog in the genesis of cancer stem-like cells. using primary murine p53-knockout astrocytes (p53(-/-) astrocytes), we provide evidence that enforced nanog expression can increase the cellular growth rate and transform phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. in addition, nanog drives p53(-/-) astrocytes toward a dedifferentiated, csc-like phenotype with characteristic neural stem cell/progenitor marker expression, neurosphere formation, self-renewal activity, and tumor development. these findings suggest that nanog promotes dedifferentiation of p53-deficient mouse astrocytes into cancer stem-like cells by changing the cell fate and transforming cell properties. somatic cell nuclear transfer allows trans-acting factors present in the mammalian oocyte to reprogram somatic cell nuclei to an undifferentiated state. we show that four factors (oct4, sox2, nanog, and lin28) are sufficient to reprogram human somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells that exhibit the essential characteristics of embryonic stem (es) cells. these induced pluripotent human stem cells have normal karyotypes, express telomerase activity, express cell surface markers and genes that characterize human es cells, and maintain the developmental potential to differentiate into advanced derivatives of all three primary germ layers. such induced pluripotent human cell lines should be useful in the production of new disease models and in drug development, as well as for applications in transplantation medicine, once technical limitations (for example, mutation through viral integration) are eliminated.
glucose is a main metabolic substrate in the central nervous system (cns). recently, lactate has attracted renewed attention because it plays an important role in the cns as a metabolic substrate between neurons and astrocytes. lactate and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), a key enzyme for lactate and pyruvate interconversion, have been investigated. the glycogen body (gb) is a gelatinous tissue in the dorsal area of the lumbosacral spinal cord in birds. it is composed of uniform cells with high glycogen storage and is thought to be in the astroglia lineage. in this article, we investigated the ldh enzyme activity in embryo gb (embryonic d 12, 14, 16, 17, and 18) and chickens. to detect the subtype of the ldh, mrna expressions in gb were investigated and compared with those of cerebral cortex and spinal cord. by histochemical observations, ldh enzyme activity was detected in the cytoplasm of gb cells of all embryonic periods after embryonic d 12. in biochemical analysis, the enzymatic activities of the gb were higher than in the cerebral cortex. in the gb the subtype of ldh mrna was ldm-b only, and in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord, the subtype of ldh mrna was predominantly ldh-b, and a small amount of ldh-a was found in the chicken and embryo. the ldh-b mrna expression in gb was detected during all periods of the study (after embryonic d 12). these observations suggest that gb expressed only ldh-b and that gb cells are not lactate-producing cells, like astrocyte, but rather are lactate-consuming cells, similar to neurons in cns. representatives of 30 species of fish were examined for their content of ldh isozymes. one major isozyme system was found in all fish. in addition, two minor systems restricted to eyes and to gonads were found in many fish. fish may be classified into four groups on the basis of their possession of one, two, three, or five major isozymes of ldh. the major isozyme patterns can be attributed to the polymers of two protein subunits under the control of two genes, as in mammals and birds, but the variety of heteropolymers produced varies in different species. the fluke and other flatfish are exceptional in that they synthesize only one kind of subunit which polymerizes to form a single variety of ldh. all other fish produced at least two major isozymes presumably the homopolymers of a and b subunits. the three-isozyme fish produce, in addition, a single heteropolymer. a few fish produce three heteropolymers and two homopolymers to produce the characteristic pattern of five isozymes seen in mammals.    in populations of the whiting, which has five major isozymes, two mutant alleles at the b locus were discovered. each of these alleles produced polypeptides with characteristic electrophoretic mobilities. consequently, heterozygous individuals contained more than 15 isozymes.    a variety of minor isozymes that appear on zymograms may represent modifications of the major isozymes. however, the minor isozyme systems of the gonad and the eye seem to be genetically distinct molecular systems, separate from and in addition to the major isozyme system.
purpose medical professionals’ practices and knowledge regarding cancer pain management have often been cited as inadequate. this study aimed to evaluate knowledge, practices and perceived barriers regarding cancer pain management among physicians and nurses in korea. methods a nationwide questionnaire survey was administered to physicians and nurses involved in the care of cancer patients. questionnaire items covered pain assessment and documentation practices, knowledge regarding cancer pain management, the perceived barriers to cancer pain control, and processes perceived as the major causes of delay in opioid administration. results a total of 333 questionnaires (149 physicians and 284 nurses) were analyzed. nurses performed pain assessment and documentation more regularly than physicians did. although physicians had better knowledge of pain management than did nurses, both groups lacked knowledge regarding the side effects and pharmacology of opioids. physicians working in the palliative care ward and nurses who had received pain management education obtained higher scores on knowledge. physicians perceived patients’ reluctance to take opioids as a barrier to pain control, more so than did nurses, while nurses perceived patients’ tendency to under-report of pain as a barrier, more so than did physicians. physicians and nurses held different perceptions regarding major cause of delay during opioid administration. conclusions there were differences between physicians and nurses in knowledge and practices for cancer pain management. an effective educational strategy for cancer pain management is needed in order to improve medical professionals’ knowledge and clinical practices. traditional education methods for physicians have failed to impact positively upon cancer pain clinical practice. this article presents a new paradigm for physician cancer pain education based on principles of adult learning and physician behavior theory. three key issues that weave together education and institutionalization issues are reviewed: (a) how to make physicians aware that their current practice behavior is less than optimal; (b) how to match education objectives with appropriate education formats; and (c) how to change pain management practices without imposing new burdens on physician practice.
backgroundaortic stenosis (as) is a common valvular disorder, and disease severity is currently assessed by transthoracic echocardiography (tte). however, tte results can be inconsistent in some patients, thus other diagnostic modalities such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr) are demanded. while traditional unidirectional phase-contrast cmr (1dir pc-cmr) underestimates velocity if the imaging plane is misaligned to the flow direction, multi-directional acquisitions are expected to improve velocity measurement accuracy. nonetheless, clinical use of multidirectional techniques has been hindered by long acquisition times. our goal was to quantify flow parameters in patients using 1dir pc-cmr and a faster multi-directional technique (3dir pc-cmr), and compare to tte.methodstwenty-three patients were prospectively assessed with tte and cmr. slices above the aortic valve were acquired for both pc-cmr techniques and cine ssfp images were acquired to quantify left ventricular stroke volume. 3dir pc-cmr implementation included a variable density sampling pattern with acceleration rate of 8 and a reconstruction method called reveal, to significantly accelerate acquisition. 3dir pc-cmr reconstruction was performed offline and reveal-based image recovery was performed on the three (x, y, z) encoding pairs. 1dir pc-cmr was acquired with grappa acceleration rate of 2 and reconstructed online. cmr derived flow parameters and aortic valve area estimates were compared to tte.resultsreveal based 3dir pc-cmr derived parameters correlated better with tte than 1dir pc-cmr. correlations ranged from 0.61 to 0.81 between tte and 1dir pc-cmr and from 0.61 to 0.87 between tte and 3dir-pc-cmr. the correlation coefficients between tte, 1dir and 3dir pc-cmr vpeakwere 0.81 and 0.87, respectively. in comparison to reveal, tte slightly underestimates peak velocities, which is not surprising as tte is only sensitive to flow that is parallel to the acoustic beam.conclusionsby exploiting structure unique to pc-cmr, reveal enables multi-directional flow imaging in clinically feasible acquisition times. results support the hypothesis that reveal-based 3dir pc-cmr provides better estimation of hemodynamic parameters in as patients in comparison to 1dir pc-cmr. while tte can accurately measure velocity parallel to the acoustic beam, it is not sensitive to the other directions of flow. therefore, multi-directional flow imaging, which encodes all three components of the velocity vector, can potentially outperform tte in patients with eccentric or multiple jets. abbreviations: ar aortic regurgitation, as aortic stenosis, ava aortic valve area, csa cross sectional area, cwd continuous wave doppler, d diameter, hocm hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, lv left ventricle, lvot left ventricular outflow tract, mr mitral regurgitation, ms mitral stenosis, mva mitral valve area, dp pressure gradient, rv right ventricle, rvot right ventricular outflow tract, sv stroke volume, tee transesophageal echocardiography, t1/2 pressure half-time, tr tricuspid regurgitation, ts tricuspid stenosis, v velocity, vsd ventricular septal defect, vti velocity time integral
the philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms - essential thrombocythemia (et), polycythemia vera (pv), and myelofibrosis (mf) (mpns) - have recently been shown to be associated with chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ros). using whole blood transcriptional profiling, we report that several oxidative stress and anti-oxidative stress genes are significantly deregulated in mpns. among the twenty most up- and downregulated genes, atox1, defb122, gpx8, prdx2, prdx6, ptgs1, and sepp1 were progressively upregulated from et over pv to pmf, whereas akr1b1, cyba, sirt2, ttn, and ucp2 were progressively downregulated in et, pv and pmf (all fdr <0.05). the gene nrf2, encoding the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (nfe2l2 or nrf2) was significantly downregulated in all mpns. nrf2 has a key role in the regulation of the oxidative stress response and modulates both migration and retention of hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) in their niche. the patogenetic importance of nrf2 depletion in the context of expansion of the hematopoietic progenitor pool in mpns is discussed with particular focus upon the implications of concomitant downregulation of nrf2 and cxcr4 for stem cell mobilization. it is widely accepted that the p53 tumor suppressor restricts abnormal cells by induction of growth arrest or by triggering apoptosis. here we show that, in addition, p53 protects the genome from oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ros), a major cause of dna damage and genetic instability. in the absence of severe stresses, relatively low levels of p53 are sufficient for upregulation of several genes with antioxidant products, which is associated with a decrease in intracellular ros. downregulation of p53 results in excessive oxidation of dna, increased mutation rate and karyotype instability, which are prevented by incubation with the antioxidant n-acetylcysteine (nac). dietary supplementation with nac prevented frequent lymphomas characteristic of trp53-knockout mice, and slowed the growth of lung cancer xenografts deficient in p53. our results provide a new paradigm for a nonrestrictive tumor suppressor function of p53 and highlight the potential importance of antioxidants in the prophylaxis and treatment of cancer.
thyroid hemiagenesis (tha) is a rare abnormality characterized by the absence of one thyroid lobe. elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) level and higher incidence of thyroid diseases were reported in tha. the aim of the study is to evaluate the thyroid autoimmunity incidence in patients with tha and influence of higher than average tsh level on thyroid volume (tv) and its change with age. the study included a group of naive patients with tha and a control group of subjects with bilobate thyroid. all patients underwent clinical examination, thyroid ultrasound, scintiscan and laboratory tests. in the studied and control group the presence of thyroid autoantibodies (tab) was evaluated. the tha group consisted of 65 patients. in tha group 53.85 % of patients were positive for tab. patients with positive tab were older (46.0 ± 18.3 years) than those with negative (35.0 ± 19.8 years); p = 0.02. the incidence of tab was lower in controls (13.85 %, p < 0.0001). in the study group, positive correlation between the age and tv (r = 0.46, p = 0.0001), and negative correlations between the age and tsh level (r = −0.31, p = 0.01), and tsh concentration and tv (r = −0.35, p = 0.004) were found. in a subgroup of 30 patients with tha negative for tab, even stronger correlations were observed. the median single lobe volume and median tsh level were higher in patients with tha when compared to controls (13.60 vs 8.20 ml, p < 0.0001; 3.23 vs 1.48 µu/ml, p < 0.0001, respectively). patients with tha constitute an in vivo model of long-term thyroid tsh overstimulation. further studies are needed to reveal, whether tsh overstimulation may be the trigger for thyroid autoimmunity. fewer than 10 families have been reported with dilated cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism (dcm-hh), which has been described as the ‘‘congestive cardiomyopathy-hypertrophic hypogonadism syndrome,’’ and may include mental retardation, broad nasal base, collagenoma, blepharoptosis, arachnodactyly, kyphoscoliosis,deafness, blindness, and minor bone abnormalities [najjar et al., 1973, 1984; sacks et al., 1980; malouf et al., 1985; warren et al., 1987; narahara et al., 1992]. because the phenotype is variable, genetic heterogeneity is likely. we report a new family with three siblings, in whom the proband also had thyroid hemiagenesis. the propositus is a 19-year-old male of turkish ancestry with dcm-hh born to unrelated parents. two older sisters had dcm confirmed by echocardiography, one of whom died as a result of dcm at 13 years of age. an autopsy was not permitted by family. an affected living sister is currently under consideration for cardiac transplantation. she also has hypertrophic hypogonadism with a normal thyroid by ultrasonography and no additional features of dcm-hh. the patient’s parents and youngest (third) sister were clinically and echocardiographically normal. at age 14 years, the propositus had been admitted to hospital for evaluation of heart failure due to dcm diagnosed in early childhood, complicated by ventricular tachycardia and recurrent cardiac decompensation. orthotopic heart transplantation was performed 12 months after initial admission, and he did well after the operation. at age 18 years, he had an endocrine consultation to evaluate delayed secondary sexual characteristics which included a eunuchoid appearance, absent facial hair and scant axillary and pubic hair, microphallus (stretched penile length 4 cm), and prepubertal testicular size (1 ml using prader orchidometer). there were no palpable masses in either testicle. the right lobe of the thyroid gland was easily palpable, but the left lobe was nonpalpable. hormonal assessment supported the diagnosis of hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism with serum total testosterone 220 ng/dl (normal range, 280– 880 ng/dl), serum-free testosterone 7.35 ng/ml (normal range, 10–42 ng/ml), luteinizing hormone 22.8 miu/ml (normal range, 1.7–8.6 miu/ml), and follicle-stimulating hormone 49.7 miu/ml (normal range, 0.7–11.4 miu/ml). he was treated with intramuscular testosterone at a dose of 250 mg every 3 weeks. after 3 months, the serum level of folliclestimulating hormone normalized (7.6 miu/ml) and the serum-free testosterone level was 22.6 ng/ml. in the following months, the patient showed progressive muscular development, voice deepening, facial and body hair, penis growth to 8 cm, and increased testicular volume. thyroid function tests at initial endocrine consultation were consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism. thyroid ultrasonography and scintigraphy (sodium 99m tc pertechnetate) showed absence of the left lobe of the thyroid gland and isthmus. twenty-five to thirty percent of the cases of dcm are familial which can be transmitted as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, x-linked, or as a matrilineal (mitochondrial) trait [seidman and seidman, 2001]. table i summarizes the clinical data on the ‘‘syndrome’’ of dcm combined with hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism (dcm-hh) and other
many neurons that initially respond to a stimulus stop responding if the stimulus is presented repeatedly but recover their response if a different stimulus is presented. this phenomenon is referred to as stimulus-specific adaptation (ssa). ssa has been investigated extensively using oddball experiments, which measure the responses of a neuron to sequences of stimuli. neurons that exhibit ssa respond less vigorously to common stimuli, and the metric typically used to quantify this difference is the ssa index (si). this article presents the first detailed analysis of the si metric by examining the question: how should a system (e.g., a neuron) respond to stochastic input if it is to maximize the si of its output? questions like this one are particularly relevant to those wishing to construct computational models of ssa. if an artificial neural network receives stimulus information at a particular rate and must respond within a fixed time, what is the highest si one can reasonably expect? we demonstrate that the optimum, average si is constrained by the information in the input source, the length and encoding of the memory, and the assumptions concerning how the task is decomposed. neurons in the primary auditory cortex respond less strongly to a commonly occurring “standard” tone than to the same tone when it is rare or “deviant.” this phenomenon, called “stimulus-specific adaptation” (ssa), has been proposed as a possible single-neuron correlate of the mismatch negativity, a cortical evoked potential associated with stimulus novelty. previous studies in cat did not observe ssa in single neurons in the auditory thalamus. however, these reports did not differentiate between the auditory thalamic subdivisions and did not examine the effects of changing the stimulus presentation rate. to explore the possibility of thalamic ssa more completely, we recorded extracellularly from 30 single units and 22 multiunit clusters in the ventral, medial, and dorsal subdivisions of the mouse medial geniculate body (mgb), while presenting the anesthetized animals with sequences of standard and deviant tones at interstimulus intervals of 400, 500 and 800 ms. we found ssa in the auditory thalamus at all three stimulus presentation rates, primarily in the medial subdivision but to a lesser degree also in the ventral mgb. thalamic ssa was evident from the earliest onset of tone-evoked activity, although the latencies of responses to standard and deviant tones were not significantly different. together with related findings of ssa in neurons of the “belt” regions of the inferior colliculus, these results demonstrate that ssa is present at subcortical levels, primarily in but not restricted to the nonlemniscal auditory pathway.
abstract the adeno-associated viruses (aavs) display differential cell binding, transduction, and antigenic characteristics specified by their capsid viral protein (vp) composition. toward structure-function annotation, the crystal structure of aav5, one of the most sequence diverse aav serotypes, was determined to 3.45-å resolution. the aav5 vp and capsid conserve topological features previously described for other aavs but uniquely differ in the surface-exposed hi loop between βh and βi of the core β-barrel motif and have pronounced conformational differences in two of the aav surface variable regions (vrs), vr-iv and vr-vii. the hi loop is structurally conserved in other aavs despite amino acid differences but is smaller in aav5 due to an amino acid deletion. this hi loop is adjacent to vr-vii, which is largest in aav5. the vr-iv, which forms the larger outermost finger-like loop contributing to the protrusions surrounding the icosahedral 3-fold axes of the aavs, is shorter in aav5, creating a smoother capsid surface topology. the hi loop plays a role in aav capsid assembly and genome packaging, and vr-iv and vr-vii are associated with transduction and antigenic differences, respectively, between the aavs. a comparison of interior capsid surface charge and volume of aav5 to aav2 and aav4 showed a higher propensity of acidic residues but similar volumes, consistent with comparable dna packaging capacities. this structure provided a three-dimensional (3d) template for functional annotation of the aav5 capsid with respect to regions that confer assembly efficiency, dictate cellular transduction phenotypes, and control antigenicity. abstract adeno-associated viruses (aavs) are being developed as gene therapy vectors, and their efficacy could be improved by a detailed understanding of their viral capsid structures. aav serotype 8 (aav8) shows a significantly greater liver transduction efficiency than those of other serotypes, which has resulted in efforts to develop this virus as a gene therapy vector for hemophilia a and familial hypercholesterolemia. pseudotyping studies show that the differential tissue tropism and transduction efficiencies exhibited by the aavs result from differences in their capsid viral protein (vp) amino acids. towards identifying the structural features underpinning these disparities, we report the crystal structure of the aav8 viral capsid determined to 2.6-å resolution. the overall topology of its common overlapping vp is similar to that previously reported for the crystal structures of aav2 and aav4, with an eight-stranded β-barrel and long loops between the β-strands. the most significant structural differences between aav8 and aav2 (the best-characterized serotype) are located on the capsid surface at protrusions surrounding the two-, three-, and fivefold axes at residues reported to control transduction efficiency and antibody recognition for aav2. in addition, a comparison of the aav8 and aav2 capsid surface amino acids showed a reduced distribution of basic charge for aav8 at the mapped aav2 heparin sulfate receptor binding region, consistent with an observed non-heparin-binding phenotype for aav8. thus, this aav8 structure provides an additional platform for mutagenesis efforts to characterize aav capsid regions responsible for differential cellular tropism, transduction, and antigenicity for these promising gene therapy vectors.
the routine assessment of xenobiotic in vivo kinetic behavior is currently dependent upon data obtained through animal experimentation, although in vitro surrogates for determining key absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination properties are available. here we present a unique, generic, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (pbpk) model and demonstrate its application to the estimation of rat plasma pharmacokinetics, following intravenous dosing, from in vitro data alone. the model was parameterized through an optimization process, using a training set of in vivo data taken from the literature and validated using a separate test set of in vivo discovery compound data. on average, the vertical divergence of the predicted plasma concentrations from the observed data, on a semilog concentration-time plot, was approximately 0.5 log unit. around 70% of all the predicted values of a standardized measure of area under the concentration-time curve (auc) were within 3-fold of the observed values, as were over 90% of the training set t1/2 predictions and 60% of those for the test set; however, there was a tendency to overpredict t1/2 for the test set compounds. the capability of the model to rank compounds according to a given criterion was also assessed: of the 25% of the test set compounds ranked by the model as having the largest values for auc, 61% were correctly identified. these validation results lead us to conclude that the generic pbpk model is potentially a powerful and cost-effective tool for predicting the mammalian pharmacokinetics of a wide range of organic compounds, from readily available in vitro inputs only. 1. what's it all about? 2. input: concepts, instances, attributes 3. output: knowledge representation 4. algorithms: the basic methods 5. credibility: evaluating what's been learned 6. implementations: real machine learning schemes 7. moving on: engineering the input and output 8. nuts and bolts: machine learning algorithms in java 9. looking forward
alzheimer's disease (ad) is closely associated with significant defects in glucose metabolism. to investigate whether ad pathology induced by overexpression of human mutant presenilin 2 (ps2) protein induces changes in glucose metabolism, glucose‑related factors were analyzed in the brain of 12‑month‑old neuron‑specific enolase (nse)/hps2m transgenic (tg) mice. nse/hps2m tg mice used in this study showed ad‑like phenotypes such as the accumulation of aβ‑42, the increase of γ‑secretase activity and tau hyperphosphorylation. a significant increase of glucose levels accompanied by a decrease of insulin levels was detected in nse/hps2m tg mice, while the expression levels of insulin receptors were significantly decreased in nse/hps2m tg mice compared to the non‑tg littermates without affecting the insulin‑like growth factor (igf) receptor. moreover, the levels of akt phosphorylation involved in the downregulation of the insulin receptor signaling pathway were reduced in the brain of nse/hps2m tg mice compared with non‑tg littermate, although the levels of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (gsk‑3) β phosphorylation were higher in the nse/hps2m tg mice compared to non-tg littermates. furthermore, the levels of the expression of glut‑1 and ‑3 were significantly reduced in the nse/hps2m tg mice compared to those of control mice without affecting the glut‑4 protein expression between the two groups of mice. in particular, the levels of the aβ‑42 peptide in the brain of insulin‑treated nse/hps2m tg mice were found to be slightly lower compared with those of the aβ‑42 peptide in the non‑treated ps2 transgenic mice. thus, the data presented in this study provide strong evidence that key factors of glucose metabolism are closely associated with the ad pathology induced by the hps2m protein, and that insulin can serve as a potential therapeutic for ad patients. cerebellar granule cells grown in the presence of a serum complex differentiate but are resistant to the lethal action of excitatory amino acids. when these cells are grown also in the presence of insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) they become fully susceptible to the toxic, lethal action of glutamate. the glutamate-sensitizing action of igf-i is dependent on concentration (half-maximal effect at 2-4 ng/ml) and time (half-maximal effect at 2-4 days in vitro) and is paralleled by the appearance of functionally active, glutamate-activated, ca2+ channels and of voltage-gated na+ and late k+ channels. igf-i-induced glutamate sensitivity is rapidly reversible (t1/2 = 30-60 min) after removal of this somatomedin. the action of igf-i is not mimicked by igf-ii, nerve growth factor, basic or acidic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, or tumor necrosis factor alpha. we postulate that the constitutive phenotype of cerebellar granule cells is glutamate-resistant and becomes responsive to excitatory amino acids under the action of epigenetic cues among which igf-i may be one of those operative in vivo.
epidemiologic evidence supports a link between serum uric acid (sua) and vascular complications in diabetes, but it remains unclear whether sua improves the ability of conventional risk factor to predict complications. we hypothesized that sua at baseline would independently predict the development of vascular complications over 6 years and that the addition of sua to american diabetes association’s abc risk factors (hba1c, bp, ldl-c) would improve vascular complication prediction over 6 years in adults with type 1 diabetes. study participants (n = 652) were 19–56 year old at baseline and re-examined 6 years later. diabetic nephropathy was defined as incident albuminuria or rapid gfr decline (>3.3 %/year) estimated by the ckd-epi cystatin c. diabetic retinopathy (dr) was based on self-reported history, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (pdr) was defined as laser eye therapy; coronary artery calcium (cac) was measured using electron-beam computed tomography. progression of cac (cacp) was defined as a change in the square-root-transformed cac volume ≥2.5. predictors of each complication were examined in stepwise logistic regression with subjects with complications at baseline excluded from analyses. c-statistics, integrated discrimination indices and net-reclassification improvement were utilized for prediction performance analyses. sua independently predicted development of incident albuminuria (or 1.8, 95 % ci 1.2–2.7), rapid gfr decline (1.9, 1.1–3.3), dr (1.4, 1.1–1.9), pdr (2.1, 1.4–3.0) and cacp (1.5, 1.1–1.9). sua improved the discrimination and net-classification risk of vascular complications over 6 years. sua independently predicted the development of vascular complications in type 1 diabetes and also improved the reclassification of vascular complications. background immunoglobulin-a nephropathy (igan) is the most common chronic glomerulonephritis worldwide. many clinical and histopathological risk factors for progression have been found previously. recently, metabolic risk factors, such as hyperuricaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia, also have been associated with the progression of igan.   methods in the present study we correlated clinical and metabolic risk factors with histopathological parameters in 202 patients with igan. morphological changes in glomerular, tubulointerstitial and vascular tissue were semiquantitatively graded into three classes. mesangial proliferation activity and the amount of inflammatory cells were also evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of ki-67 (mib-1), cd45 (lca) and cd68 stainings. serum uric acid, triglycerides and cholesterol, urine protein excretion (upe), blood pressure and body mass index (bmi) were measured. smoking habits and occurrence of diabetes mellitus also were evaluated. the independent role of serum uric acid in the development of renal morphological changes was evaluated in multivariate analysis.   results serum uric acid and upe level correlated with several histological parameters. uric acid level showed the strongest correlation with tubulointerstitial changes and upe with glomerulosclerosis. the level of serum triglycerides correlated with interstitial fibrosis and hyaline arteriolosclerosis. blood pressure correlated with hyaline arteriolosclerosis, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial changes. bmi and diabetes mellitus correlated with both tubulointerstitial and vascular changes. we found no significant correlations between histopathological parameters and smoking habits or serum cholesterol level. serum uric acid had independent associations with the presence of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis and inflammation.   conclusions we conclude that many metabolic factors are univariately associated with renal morphological findings in igan. these same factors are central in the metabolic or insulin resistance syndrome and may have a pathogenetic role in the progression of igan. serum uric acid may have an independent role in development of tubulointerstitial lesions as well as being associated with inflammation in renal tissue of patients with igan.
purpose: to evaluate the selectivity and strength of intraoperative trypan blue staining during removal of epiretinal membranes (erms) and the internal limiting membrane. methods: based on intraoperative videos, 51 consecutive chromovitrectomies in 51 patients with macular holes, macular pucker, vitreomacular traction syndromes, or persistent macular edema were retrospectively studied. fifteen subjects underwent trypan blue, 14 indocyanine green, and 22 brilliant blue g chromovitrectomy. the main outcome measure was the color contrast between stained internal limiting membrane or erm and the underlying unstained tissue by means of objective, quantitative, semiautomated chromaticity difference measurements. results: trypan blue stains both erm and the internal limiting membrane (average chromaticity scores 8.51 and 7.09, respectively; p = 0.48). internal limiting membrane chromaticity scores were similar for trypan blue (7.09) and brilliant blue g (6.81; p = 0.71) but clearly higher for indocyanine green (15.81; p = 2.45 × 10−5). conclusion: under the premises of our study, trypan blue stains both erm and the internal limiting membrane. trypan blue's staining capacity of the internal limiting membrane is similar to that of brilliant blue g but significantly inferior compared with indocyanine green. trypan blue, thus, represents a useful vital dye for chromovitrectomy, particularly in the presence of erm, where it allows a sequential approach. purpose:  to evaluate the potential of brilliant blue g (bbg) for intraoperative staining of the inner limiting membrane (ilm) with respect to staining properties and surgical outcome.
we aimed to analyze how genetic and environmental factors account for variations in body mass index (bmi), waist circumference (wc) and their mutual correlation in chinese children. we measured bmi and wc in 588 pairs of twins (53 % monozygotic twins) aged 8–17 years and applied structural equation modeling to the data. for the younger children (8–12 years of age), heritability estimates of bmi were 0.56 for boys and 0.69 for girls; for the older children (13–17 years of age), the corresponding figures were 0.64 and 0.71, respectively. we observed moderate heritability estimates in wc: the corresponding figures were 0.24 and 0.56 for the younger children, and 0.27 and 0.33 for the older children, respectively. the heterogeneity test for genetic variance of bmi and wc was statistically significant between the two age groups for both sexes (p < 0.001). the proportions of bmi and wc variations due to shared and non-shared environmental factors remained stable during childhood in both sexes. bivariate genetic analyses showed that genetic correlations between bmi and wc were strong for the younger children (rg = 0.75 for boys, rg = 0.98 for girls) and the older children (rg = 1.0 for both boys and girls). both sexes showed moderate non-shared environmental correlations in the two age groups, whereas shared environmental correlations––except among male younger children––were not statistically significant. genetic factors play an important role in variations in bmi and wc during childhood. common genetic and non-shared environmental factors explained most of the association between bmi and wc for both boys and girls. with the changing patterns of morbidity and mortality in china, noncommunicable chronic diseases have become the major threats to the health of the chinese population. the causes of chronic diseases include genetic factors and behavioral risk factors such as the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs, unhealthy dietary behaviors, and lack of physical activity. twin studies offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the genetic and environmental risk and protective factors for chronic disease. the qingdao twin registry (qtr) was initiated in 1998 as part of the national chinese twin registry. over 11,000 pairs of twins and multiples of all ages have been recruited into the registry. several studies of physical and mental health are underway. many of the adult twins have completed health and behavioral risk factor surveys, and the adolescent twins are participating in a study of gene-environment interactions in tobacco and alcohol use. studies of the heritability of personality factors have been conducted. in 2002, qingdao established the qingdao twin health promotion association, a nonprofit organization that supports health services for twins and their parents, organizes special events and health-related activities for twins, and raises funds to conduct twin health examinations. the qtr will be a useful resource for future studies of population genetics in human health and disease.
ubiquitylation is a necessary step in the endocytosis and lysosomal trafficking of many plasma membrane proteins and can also influence protein trafficking in the biosynthetic pathway. although a molecular understanding of ubiquitylation in these processes is beginning to emerge, very little is known about the role deubiquitylation may play. fat facets in mouse (fam) is substrate-specific deubiquitylating enzyme highly expressed in epithelia where it interacts with its substrate, beta-catenin. here we show, in the polarized intestinal epithelial cell line t84, fam localized to multiple points of protein trafficking. fam interacted with beta-catenin and e-cadherin in t84 cells but only in subconfluent cultures. fam extensively colocalized with beta-catenin in cytoplasmic puncta but not at sites of cell-cell contact as well as immunoprecipitating with beta-catenin and e-cadherin from a higher molecular weight complex ( approximately 500 kda). at confluence fam neither colocalized with, nor immunoprecipitated, beta-catenin or e-cadherin, which were predominantly in a larger molecular weight complex ( approximately 2 mda) at the cell surface. overexpression of fam in mcf-7 epithelial cells resulted in increased beta-catenin levels, which localized to the plasma membrane. expression of e-cadherin in l-cell fibroblasts resulted in the relocalization of fam from the golgi to cytoplasmic puncta. these data strongly suggest that fam associates with e-cadherin and beta-catenin during trafficking to the plasma membrane. the golgi apparatus is a dynamic organelle through which nascent secretory and transmembrane proteins are transported, post-translationally modified and finally packaged into carrier vesicles for transport along the cytoskeleton to a variety of destinations. in the past decade, studies have shown that a number of 'molecular motors' are involved in maintaining the proper structure and function of the golgi apparatus. here, we review just some of the many functions performed by these mechanochemical enzymes — dyneins, kinesins, myosins and dynamin — in relation to the golgi apparatus.
karlos x. moreno, santhosh satapati, ralph j. deberardinis, shawn c. burgess, craig r. malloy **, and matthew e. merritt 1 from the advanced imaging research center, children’s medical center research institute, and departments of pharmacology and radiology, university of texas – southwestern medical center, dallas, texas 75390 and the **veterans affairs north texas healthcare system, lancaster, texas 75216 a method is introduced for estimating the contribution of gluconeogenesis to glucose production. 2h2o is administered orally to achieve 0.5% deuterium enrichment in body water. enrichments are determined in the hydrogens bound to carbons 2 and 6 of blood glucose and in urinary water. enrichment at carbon 6 of glucose is assayed in hexamethylenetetramine, formed from formaldehyde produced by periodate oxidation of the glucose. enrichment at carbon 2 is assayed in lactate formed by enzymatic transfer of the hydrogen from glucose via sorbitol to pyruvate. the fraction gluconeogenesis contributes to glucose production equals the ratio of the enrichment at carbon 6 to that at carbon 2 or in urinary water. applying the method, the contribution of gluconeogenesis in healthy subjects was 23-42% after fasting 14 h, increasing to 59-84% after fasting 42 h. enrichment at carbon 2 to that in urinary water was 1.12 +/- 0.13. therefore, the assumption that hydrogen equilibrated during hexose-6-p isomerization was fulfilled. the 3h/14c ratio in glucose formed from [3-3h,3-14c]lactate given to healthy subjects was 0.1 to 0.2 of that in the lactate. therefore equilibration during gluconeogenesis of the hydrogen bound to carbon 6 with that in body water was 80-90% complete, so that gluconeogenesis is underestimated by 10-20%. glycerol's contribution to gluconeogenesis is not included in these estimates. the method is applicable to studies in humans of gluconeogenesis at safe doses of 2h2o.
it has previously been proposed that prefrontal cortex may have some role in keeping temporal cortex-based representations "on-line" during a working memory task. to test this hypothesis, the effects of electrolytic prefrontal cortex lesions on the firing of area te and perirhinal cortex (prc) neurons were examined while rats performed a delayed non-match to position task in the t-maze. the behavioural performance of control (n = 4) and lesioned (n = 4) animals were similar during this task, and many neurons displayed a statistically significant location-related variation in firing rate during the sample (44/56 neurons) and test (39/56 neurons) phases. units from prefrontal-lesioned animals (82%) were more likely to display a significant variation in firing across the maze compared to controls (50%; p < 0.01), and to have more discrete location-related properties (50% of neurons) compared to the control (5%) group (p < 0.0005). this finding suggests that prefrontal cortex normally modulates the transmission and/or processing of spatial information in area te/prc during a working memory task. modulation could be mediated through direct connections between the structures or via prefrontal control of subcortical structures. this finding has implications for our understanding of prefrontal-temporal involvement in memory and cognitive disorders. 1. the dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons projecting to the hippocampal formation are distributed in three cell groups: a8 region in the retrorubral field, a9 region in the substantia nigra and a10 region in the ventral tegmental area. 2. anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing techniques combined with immunohistochemical procedures indicate a topographical organization of mesencephalic dopaminergic projections towards the hippocampal formation. 3. electrophysiological evidence suggest that dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons could have a regulatory role in suppressing hippocampal excitability. 4. the functional significance of the mesohippocampal dopaminergic system is largely unknown, although it was suggested that this projection could have a role in methamphetamine-produced hypermotility and in modulation of memory processes.
objective to study the relationship and changes of cervical mri, tcd and baep in patients with "isolated" vertigo.   methods the relationship and changes of cervical mri, tcd and baep were investigated respectively in 125 patients with "isolated" vertigo and 100 healthy controls.   results there were statistically significant differences between two groups for overall abnormalities of tcd (x(2) = 61.96, p<0.01), baep (x(2) = 97.99, p<0.01), and cervical mri severity scale (z = -8.71, p<0.01). in vertigo group, results showed significant correlations between tcd and cervical mri, tcd and baep as well. and analysis on tcd pi and some items of baep demonstrated positive linear correlations. there were no statistical differences or correlations in control group.   conclusions tcd is a sensitive method of "isolated" vertigo screening. a combined test protocol of cervical mri, tcd and baep has superiorities to assess "isolated" vertigo. abstract objectives: vertigo can be a manifestation of underlying vertebrobasilar stroke in older adults. the study objectives were to investigate the correlation, sensitivity, and specificity of the auditory brainstem response (abr), electronystagmorgraphy (eng), and transcranial doppler (tcd) collectively to distinguish between vertigo due to vertebrobasilar insufficiency (vbi) and vertigo due to non-vbi. design: prospective experimental study comparing eng, abr, and tcd battery findings between two groups of patients with vertigo and a control group. study sample: participants included 14 patients with vertigo of vbi origin, 14 patients with vertigo of non-vbi, and 11 matched controls. results: participants with vbi had more abnormal findings in the eng (86%), tcd (72%), and abr (64%) compared to the non-vbi group (64%, 21%, and 7%, respectively) and the control group. the combined battery revealed positive correlations, 64% sensitivity, and 84% positive predictive value (ppv) in the vbi group, and 100% specificity with lack of correlations in the non-vbi group. conclusions: the modest sensitivity and ppv helps with early detection of vbi, thus preventing risk of vertebrobasilar stroke in 84% to 64% of patients. the 100% specificity in the non-vbi group rules out vbi, thus reducing the referral rate for unnecessary, diagnostic evaluations and ineffective treatment.
chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massive parallel sequencing (chip-seq) is a powerful technology to identify the genome-wide locations of dna binding proteins such as transcription factors or modified histones. as more and more experimental laboratories are adopting chip-seq to unravel the transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, computational analyses of chip-seq also become increasingly comprehensive and sophisticated. in this article, we review current computational methodology for chip-seq analysis, recommend useful algorithms and workflows, and introduce quality control measures at different analytical steps. we also discuss how chip-seq could be integrated with other types of genomic assays, such as gene expression profiling and genome-wide association studies, to provide a more comprehensive view of gene regulatory mechanisms in important physiological and pathological processes. recent progress in massively parallel sequencing platforms has enabled genome-wide characterization of dna-associated proteins using the combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (chip-seq). although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative chip microarray (chip-chip), few approaches have been described for processing chip-seq data. to fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. we compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. we also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.
both acute and chronic apelin treatment have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in mice. however, the effects of apelin on fatty acid oxidation (fao) during obesity-related insulin resistance have not yet been addressed. thus, the aim of the current study was to determine the impact of chronic treatment on lipid use, especially in skeletal muscles. high-fat diet (hfd)-induced obese and insulin-resistant mice treated by an apelin injection (0.1 μmol/kg/day i.p.) during 4 weeks had decreased fat mass, glycemia, and plasma levels of triglycerides and were protected from hyperinsulinemia compared with hfd pbs-treated mice. indirect calorimetry experiments showed that apelin-treated mice had a better use of lipids. the complete fao, the oxidative capacity, and mitochondrial biogenesis were increased in soleus of apelin-treated mice. the action of apelin was amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) dependent since all the effects studied were abrogated in hfd apelin-treated mice with muscle-specific inactive ampk. finally, the apelin-stimulated improvement of oxidative capacity led to decreased levels of acylcarnitines and enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in soleus. thus, by promoting complete lipid use in muscle of insulin-resistant mice through mitochondrial biogenesis and tighter matching between fao and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, apelin treatment could contribute to insulin sensitivity improvement. adipose tissue (at) secretes several adipokines that influence insulin sensitivity and potentially link obesity to insulin resistance. apelin, a peptide present in different tissues, is also secreted by adipocytes. apelin is upregulated in obese and hyperinsulinemic humans and mice. although a tight relation exists between the regulation of apelin and insulin, it remains largely unknown whether apelin affects whole-body glucose utilization. herein, we show that in chow-fed mice, acute intravenous injection of apelin has a powerful glucose-lowering effect associated with enhanced glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and at. through in vivo and in vitro pharmacological and genetic approaches, we demonstrate the involvement of endothelial no synthase, amp-activated protein kinase, and akt in apelin-stimulated glucose uptake in soleus muscle. remarkably, in obese and insulin-resistant mice, apelin restored glucose tolerance and increased glucose utilization. apelin could thus represent a promising target in the management of insulin resistance.
mammalian circadian rhythms are orchestrated by the suprachiasmatic nuclei (scn) of the hypothalamus. the scn are composed of circadian clock neurons, but the mechanisms by which these populations of neuronal oscillators encode rhythmic behavior are incompletely understood. we have used ex vivo real-time gene expression imaging of the neural correlates of circadian behavior, combined with genetic disruption of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, a key scn signaling molecule, to examine the neural basis of circadian organization in the scn. we show that the coherence and timing of clock neuron rhythms are correlated with the coherence and timing of behavioral rhythms within individual mice and that the degree of disruption of scn neuronal organization correlates with the degree of behavioral disruption within individuals. our results suggest that the scn encode circadian phase as a temporal population vector of its constituent neurons; such that as the neuronal population becomes desynchronized, phase information becomes ambiguous. the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn) is a master circadian pacemaker. it is not known which scn neurons are autonomous pacemakers or how they synchronize their daily firing rhythms to coordinate circadian behavior. vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (vip) and the vip receptor vpac2 (encoded by the gene vipr2) may mediate rhythms in individual scn neurons, synchrony between neurons, or both. we found that vip−/− and vipr2−/− mice showed two daily bouts of activity in a skeleton photoperiod and multiple circadian periods in constant darkness. loss of vip or vpac2 also abolished circadian firing rhythms in approximately half of all scn neurons and disrupted synchrony between rhythmic neurons. critically, daily application of a vpac2 agonist restored rhythmicity and synchrony to vip−/− scn neurons, but not to vipr2−/− neurons. we conclude that vip coordinates daily rhythms in the scn and behavior by synchronizing a small population of pacemaking neurons and maintaining rhythmicity in a larger subset of neurons.
the present study was conducted to investigate the possible protective effects of lycopene (lc) and ellagic acid (ea) on cyclophosphamide (cp)-induced testicular and spermatozoal toxicity associated with the oxidative stress and apoptosis in male rats. forty-eight healthy adult male sprague-dawley rats were divided into six groups of eight rats each. the control group was treated with placebo; the lc, ea and cp groups were given lc (10 mg kg(-1)), ea (2 mg kg(-1)) and cp (15 mg kg(-1)), respectively, alone; the cp+lc group was treated with a combination of cp (15 mg kg(-1)) and lc (10 mg kg(-1)); and the cp+ea group was treated with a combination of cp (15 mg kg(-1)) and ea (2 mg kg(-1)). all treatments were maintained for 8 weeks. at the end of the treatment period, bodyweight and the weight of the reproductive organs, sperm concentration and motility, testicular tissue lipid peroxidation, anti-oxidant enzyme activity and apoptosis (i.e. bax and bcl-2 proteins) were determined. administration of cp resulted in significant decreases in epididymal sperm concentration and motility and significant increases in malondialdehyde levels. although cp significantly increased the number of bax-positive (apoptotic) cells, it had no effect on the number of bcl-2-positive (anti-apoptotic) cells compared with the control group. however, combined treatment of rats with lc or ea in addition to cp prevented the development of cp-induced lipid peroxidation and sperm and testicular damage. in conclusion, cp-induced lipid peroxidation leads to structural and functional damage, as well as apoptosis, in spermatogenic cells of rats. both lc and ea protect against the development of these detrimental effects. the present study was undertaken to find out the adverse effects of cyclophosphamide on testicular activities along with testicular oxidative stress at its therapeutic dose and the protective effects of f -tocopherol succinate on testicular dysfunctions induced by cyclophosphamide in mature albino rats. a significant diminution in the activities of testicular j 5 , 3 g -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (hsd) and 17 g -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (hsd) along with significant reduction in the plasma level of testosterone and number of spermatogonia-a (asg), preleptotene spermatocytes (plsc), midpachytene spermatocytes (mpsc) and step 7 spermatids (7sd) at stage vii of spermatogenic cycle were observed following cyclophosphamide treatment. oxidative stress was also noted in testis, which was enlightened by significant elevation in the level of malondialdehyde (mda) and conjugated dienes along with significant reduction in the activities of testicular peroxidase and catalase. co-administration of f -tocopherol succinate in cyclophosphamide-treated rats resulted a significant restoration of all the above-mentioned parameters to the control level. the results of our experiment suggest that cyclophosphamide treatment at its clinical dose is associated with antigonadal activities as well as induction of oxidative stress in gonad that can be ameliorated significantly by f -tocopherol succinate co-administration. so, our data have some potential clinical implications.
membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (mt1-mmp) is a promising drug target in malignancy. the structure of mt1-mmp includes the hemopexin domain (pex) that is distinct from and additional to the catalytic domain. current mmp inhibitors target the conserved active site in the catalytic domain and, as a result, repress the proteolytic activity of multiple mmps instead of mt1-mmp alone. in our search for noncatalytic inhibitors of mt1-mmp, we compared the protumorigenic activity of wild-type mt1-mmp with an mt1-mmp mutant lacking pex (δpex). in contrast to mt1-mmp, δpex did not support tumor growth in vivo, and its expression resulted in small fibrotic tumors that contained increased levels of collagen. because these findings suggested an important role for pex in tumor growth, we carried out an inhibitor screen to identify small molecules targeting the pex domain of mt1-mmp. using the developmental therapeutics program (national cancer institute/nih), virtual ligand screening compound library as a source and the x-ray crystal structure of pex as a target, we identified and validated a novel pex inhibitor. low dosage, intratumoral injections of pex inhibitor repressed tumor growth and caused a fibrotic, δpex-like tumor phenotype in vivo. together, our findings provide a preclinical proof of principle rationale for the development of novel and selective mt1-mmp inhibitors that specifically target the pex domain. invasive cell migration through tissue barriers requires pericellular remodelling of extracellular matrix (ecm) executed by cell-surface proteases, particularly membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (mt1-mmp/mmp-14). using time-resolved multimodal microscopy, we show how invasive ht-1080 fibrosarcoma and mda-mb-231 breast cancer cells coordinate mechanotransduction and fibrillar collagen remodelling by segregating the anterior force-generating leading edge containing β1 integrin, mt1-mmp and f-actin from a posterior proteolytic zone executing fibre breakdown. during forward movement, sterically impeding fibres are selectively realigned into microtracks of single-cell calibre. microtracks become expanded by multiple following cells by means of the large-scale degradation of lateral ecm interfaces, ultimately prompting transition towards collective invasion similar to that in vivo. both ecm track widening and transition to multicellular invasion are dependent on mt1-mmp-mediated collagenolysis, shown by broad-spectrum protease inhibition and rna interference. thus, invasive migration and proteolytic ecm remodelling are interdependent processes that control tissue micropatterning and macropatterning and, consequently, individual and collective cell migration.
erdheim-chester disease is a rare systemic non-langerhans histiocytosis of unknown etiology that affects multiple organ systems. cerebral involvement is most often caused by extra-axial masses of foamy histiocytes, whereas intraparenchymal manifestations are less frequent. review of the literature yielded a total of seven patients with increased signal intensities on t2-weighted images in both dentate nuclei and the peridentate regions. we report on a 44-year-old man with biopsy-proven erdheim-chester disease and slowly progressive cerebellar dysfunction. mri showed additional symmetrical hyperintense signal changes in the superior cerebellar peduncle as well as in the trigonum lemnisci on coronal flair images. the widespread neurological manifestations of cerebral erdheim-chester disease and differential diagnosis are discussed. two patients with erdheim-chester disease with progressive cerebellar dysfunction and pyramidal signs are reported on. cerebral mri showed bilateral increased signal intensity in peridentatal regions on t2 weighted sequences. both patients had kidney and bone involvement, established on bone biopsy for one. one patient improved with steroid therapy. this contrasts with previous reports, which describe rare neurological manifestations and the failure of different therapeutic approaches.
objective to compare the effects of combined n-acetyl cysteine (nac) and clomiphene citrate (cc) and of combined metformin and cc on ovulation induction in anovulatory cc-resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos).   methods one hundred ninety-two women were randomized to receive either the nac-cc drug combination (group a, n = 95) or the combined metformin-cc therapy (group b, n = 97) for three treatment cycles. the primary outcome measure was ovulation; secondary outcomes were number of follicles, serum estrogen and progesterone levels, posttreatment endometrial thickness, pregnancy, and miscarriage.   results over a 3-month follow-up period, women in group b had significantly higher ovulation and pregnancy rates compared with women in group a (69.1% vs. 20.0%, p = 0.002, and 22.7% vs. 5.3%, p = 0.020, respectively). the level of serum estrogen, the endometrial thickness on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) administration, and the serum progesterone level on cycle days 21-23 were all significantly higher for women in group b than for those in group a. additionally, a lower miscarriage rate was observed among women in group b than among those in group a.   conclusions the efficacy of metformin-cc combination therapy is higher than that of nac-cc for inducing ovulation and achieving pregnancy among cc-resistant pcos patients. aim. to elucidate the dynamics of fsh, lh, prolactin (prl), tsh and insulin secretion in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) treated with metformin (met). patients and methods. in a prospective, controlled and randomised trial, 32 women with pcos and 32 with normal cycle were recruited to receive met (850 mg b.i.d.) or placebo (n: 16 for each subgroup) for an average of 40 days. pituitary function and insulin secretion were assessed before and after intervention by gnrh-trh tests and oral glucose tolerance test induced insulin response. results. basal and area under the response curve (aurc) lh values were higher in pcos than in normal controls before met and declined following treatment in the former group (p < 0.05). ovulatory pcos responders had lower basal lh, aurclh and aurcprl values during met than anovulatory cases (p < 0.05 for all) and aurcins was lower in ovulatory than anovulatory pcos before and on met (p < 0.02–p < 0.05), with a rise of quicky index in the former group during met treatment (p < 0.05). fsh and tsh were similar. conclusions. met administration lowered lh activity in all pcos women and in ovulatory responders and also compromised prl stimulated secretion in the latter cases. these findings were indicative of an effect of met on pituitary activity.
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists) are defined as spindle cell and/or epithelioid tumors originated from interstitial cajal cells or precursors in the digestive tract. this study was conducted to identify genes differing in expression between the gastric tumors and the adjacent non-cancerous mucosas in patients with primary gastric gist. the gene expression profile was determined by using oligonucleotide-based dna microarrays and further validated by quantitative real-time pcr. the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathway analysis was performed to predict signaling pathways involved in gastric gist. our data showed that the expression levels of 957 genes (rab39b, member ras oncogene family; vcan, versican; etc.) were higher and that of 526 genes (cxcl14, chemokine c-x-c motif ligand 14; mtus1, microtubule-associated tumor suppressor 1; etc.) were lower in the gastric tumor tissues as compared with normal gastric tissues. results from kegg pathway analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched into 16 signaling transduction pathways, including hedeghog and wnt signaling pathways. our study may provide basis for identification of novel biomarkers associated with primary gastric gist pathogenesis and for exploration of underlying mechanisms involved in this gastric sarcoma. background and aims resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists). we investigated the mechanisms of resistance in patients with progressive gists with primary kit mutations and the efficacy of the kinase inhibitor pkc412 for the inhibition of imatinib-resistant mutants.   methods we performed a cytogenetic analysis and screened for mutations of the kit and pdgfra kinase domains in 26 resistant gists. kit autophosphorylation status was assessed by western immunoblotting. imatinib-resistant gist cells and ba/f3 cells expressing these mutant proteins were tested for sensitivity to imatinib and pkc412.   results six distinct secondary mutations in kit were detected in 12 progressive tumors, with v654a and t670i found to be recurrent. one progressive tumor showed acquired pdgfra -d842v mutation. amplification of kit or kit / pdgfra was found in 2 patients. eight of 10 progressive tumors available for analysis showed phosphorylated kit. two remaining progressive tumors lost kit protein expression. gist cells carrying kit -del557-558/t670i or kit -insay502-503/v654a mutations were resistant to imatinib, while pkc412 significantly inhibited autophosporylation of these mutants. resistance to imatinib and sensitivity to pkc412 of kit -t670i and pdgfra -d842v mutants was confirmed using ba/f3 cells.   conclusions this study shows the high frequency of kit/pdgfra kinase domain mutations in patients with secondary resistance and defines genomic amplification of kit / pdgfra as an alternative cause of resistance to the drug. in a subset of patients, cancer cells lost their dependence on the targeted tyrosine kinase. our findings show the sensitivity of the imatinib-resistant kit -t670i and kit -v654a and of pdgfra -d842v mutants to pkc412.
the angiotensin ii receptor agtr1, which mediates vasoconstrictive and inflammatory signaling in vascular disease, is overexpressed aberrantly in some breast cancers. in this study, we established the significance of an agtr1-responsive nfκb signaling pathway in this breast cancer subset. we documented that agtr1 overexpression occurred in the luminal a and b subtypes of breast cancer, was mutually exclusive of her2 expression, and correlated with aggressive features that include increased lymph node metastasis, reduced responsiveness to neoadjuvant therapy, and reduced overall survival. mechanistically, agtr1 overexpression directed both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent activation of nfκb, mediated by a signaling pathway that requires the triad of carma3, bcl10, and malt1 (cbm signalosome). activation of this pathway drove cancer cell-intrinsic responses that include proliferation, migration, and invasion. in addition, cbm-dependent activation of nfκb elicited cancer cell-extrinsic effects, impacting endothelial cells of the tumor microenvironment to promote tumor angiogenesis. cbm/nfκb signaling in agtr1+ breast cancer therefore conspires to promote aggressive behavior through pleiotropic effects. overall, our results point to the prognostic and therapeutic value of identifying agtr1 overexpression in a subset of her2-negative breast cancers, and they provide a mechanistic rationale to explore the repurposing of drugs that target angiotensin ii-dependent nfκb signaling pathways to improve the treatment of this breast cancer subset.significance: these findings offer a mechanistic rationale to explore the repurposing of drugs that target angiotensin action to improve the treatment of agtr1-expressing breast cancers. cancer res; 78(5); 1225-40. ©2017 aacr. the paracaspase malt1 has a central role in the activation of lymphocytes and other immune cells including myeloid cells, mast cells and nk cells. malt1 activity is required not only for the immune response, but also for the development of natural treg cells that keep the immune response in check. exaggerated malt1 activity has been associated with the development of lymphoid malignancies, and recently developed malt1 inhibitors show promising anti-tumor effects in xenograft models of diffuse large b cell lymphoma. in this review, we provide an overview of the present understanding of malt1’s function, and discuss possibilities for its therapeutic targeting based on recently developed inhibitors and animal models.
backgroundleishmaniasis remains among the most important parasitic diseases in the developing world and visceral leishmaniasis (vl) is the most fatal. the hamster mesocricetus auratus is a susceptible model for the characterization of the disease, since infection of hamsters with l. infantum reproduces the clinical and pathological features of human vl. in this context, it provides a unique opportunity to study vl in its active form. the main goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical, biochemical, and hematological changes in male hamsters infected through different routes and strains of l. infantum.methodsin the current study, hamsters (mesocricetus auratus) were infected with the l. infantum strains (who/mhom/br/74/pp75 and mcan/br/2008/op46) by intradermal, intraperitoneal and intracardiac routes. the animals were monitored for a nine  month follow-up period.resultsthe hamsters showed clinical signs similar to those observed in classical canine and human symptomatic vl, including splenomegaly, severe weight loss, anemia, and leucopenia. therefore the op46 strain was more infective, clinical signs were more frequent and more exacerbated in ic group with 80 to 100 % of the animals showing splenomegaly, in the last month infection. additionally, desquamation, hair loss and external mucocutaneous lesions and ulcers localized in the snout, accompanied by swelling of the paws in all animals, were observed. consequently, the animals presented severe weight loss/cachexia, hunched posture, an inability to eat or drink, and non-responsiveness to external stimuli. furthermore, regardless of strain, route of inoculum and time assessed, the animals showed renal and hepatic alterations, with increased serum levels of urea and creatinine as well as elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase.conclusionsthese results strongly suggest that the inoculation through the intracardiac route resulted in a higher severity among infections, especially in the sixth and ninth month after infection via intracardiac, exhibited clinical manifestations and biochemical/hematological findings similar to human visceral leishmaniasis. therefore, we suggest that this route must be preferentially used in experimental infections for pathogenesis studies of vl in the hamster model. to develop and test new therapeutics and immune prophylaxis strategies for visceral leishmaniasis (vl), understanding tissue parasitism evolution after experimental infection with leishmania infantum is important. experimental infection in a hamster model (mesocricetus auratus) reproduces several typical aspects of canine and human vl that are closely related to the inoculum’s route. we quantified the parasitism in the liver and spleen of hamsters experimentally infected by various routes (intradermal, intraperitoneal, and intracardiac [ic]) and different strains of l. infantum (mhom/br/74/pp75 and wild) and compared two different methodologies to evaluate tissue parasitism (leishman donovan units [ldu] and real-time qpcr). in addition, the quantification of specific total-igg in the serum of uninfected and infected hamsters was determined by elisa. the animals were followed for 1, 3, 6 and 9 months post-infection for survival analysis. we found that infection with the wild strain by the ic route resulted in higher mortality. positive antibody (igg) responses were detected with higher peaks at 6 and 9 months in the ic group inoculated with pp75 strain. however, in animals infected with the wild strain the igg levels were elevated in all infected groups during all the time evaluated. we also observed by ldu analysis that the ic route lead to higher parasitism in the liver and spleen with both strains. furthermore, qpcr showed higher sensitivity for identifying animals with low parasitic burden. in conclusion, qpcr can be useful for assessing parasitism in the spleen and liver of a hamster model infected with l. infantum independent of the route of infection, and this technique may become an essential tool for assessing parasite density in the hamster model after experimental treatment or immunization with potential vaccine candidates.
cyld has been recognized as a tumor suppressor due to its dominant genetic linkage to multiple types of epidermal tumors and a range of other cancers. the molecular mechanisms governing cyld control of skin cancer are still unclear. here, we showed that k14-driven epidermal expression of a patient-relevant and catalytically deficient cyld truncated mutant (cyldm) sensitized mice to skin tumor development in response to 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene (dmba)/(12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) tpa challenge. tumors developed on transgenic mice were prone to malignant progression and lymph node metastasis and displayed increased activation of c-jun-nh2-kinase (jnk) and the downstream c-jun and c-fos proteins. most importantly, topical application of a pharmacologic jnk inhibitor significantly reduced tumor development and abolished metastasis in the transgenic mice. further in line with these animal data, exogenous expression of cyldm in a431, a human squamous cell carcinoma (scc) cell line, markedly enhanced cell growth, migration, and subcutaneous tumor growth in an ap1-depdendent manner. in contrast, expression of the wild-type cyld inhibited scc tumorigenesis and ap1 function. most importantly, cyldm not only increased jnk activation but also induced an upregulation of k63 ubiquitination on both c-jun and c-fos, leading to sustained ap1 activation. our findings uncovered c-jun and c-fos as novel cyld targets and underscore that cyld controls epidermal tumorigenesis through blocking the jnk/ap1 signaling pathway at multiple levels. cancer prev res; 4(6); 851–9. ©2011 aacr. familial cylindromatosis is an autosomal dominant predisposition to tumours of skin appendages called cylindromas. familial cylindromatosis is caused by mutations in a gene encoding the cyld protein of previously unknown function. here we show that cyld is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates activation of the transcription factor nf-κb by specific tumour-necrosis factor receptors (tnfrs). loss of the deubiquitinating activity of cyld correlates with tumorigenesis. cyld inhibits activation of nf-κb by the tnfr family members cd40, xedar and edar in a manner that depends on the deubiquitinating activity of cyld. downregulation of cyld by rna-mediated interference augments both basal and cd40-mediated activation of nf-κb. the inhibition of nf-κb activation by cyld is mediated, at least in part, by the deubiquitination and inactivation of tnfr-associated factor 2 (traf2) and, to a lesser extent, traf6. these results indicate that cyld is a negative regulator of the cytokine-mediated activation of nf-κb that is required for appropriate cellular homeostasis of skin appendages.
this 40-year-old man was treated for suicidal quinalphos 25%ec consumption. he developed intermediate syndrome with normal response to repetitive nerve stimulation, pancreatitis with high enzyme elevations, and normal computed tomography and excreted black, brown, and orange urine sequentially over the first nine days of hospitalization. the last complication has not been previously reported with any organophosphate compound. he finally succumbed to complication of ventilator associated pneumonia related septic shock and ventricular tachycardia. pancreatitis secondary to organophosphate insecticide toxicity is rare and is believed to follow a subclinical and uneventful course. we report two cases of severe acute pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and retroperitoneal sepsis in which the diagnosis was obscured by the systemic effects of organophosphate toxicity. awareness of this complication should prompt earlier investigation because early diagnosis coupled with timely therapeutic measures may improve patient prognosis.
communication between cortical cell polarity cues and the mitotic spindle ensures proper orientation of cell divisions within complex tissues. defects in mitotic spindle positioning have been linked to various developmental disorders and have recently emerged as a potential contributor to tumorigenesis. despite the importance of this process to human health, the molecular mechanisms that regulate spindle orientation are not fully understood. moreover, it remains unclear how diverse cortical polarity complexes might cooperate to influence spindle positioning. we and others have demonstrated spindle orientation roles for dishevelled (dsh), a key regulator of planar cell polarity, and discs large (dlg), a conserved apico-basal cell polarity regulator, effects which were previously thought to operate within distinct molecular pathways. here we identify a novel direct interaction between the dsh-pdz domain and the alternatively spliced “i3-insert” of the dlg-hook domain, thus establishing a potential convergent dsh/dlg pathway. furthermore, we identify a dlg sequence motif necessary for the dsh interaction that shares homology to the site of dsh binding in the frizzled receptor. expression of dsh enhanced dlg-mediated spindle positioning similar to deletion of the hook domain. this dsh-mediated activation was dependent on the dlg-binding partner, gukholder (gukh). these results suggest that dsh binding may regulate core interdomain conformational dynamics previously described for dlg. together, our results identify dlg as an effector of dsh signaling and demonstrate a dsh-mediated mechanism for the activation of dlg/gukh-dependent spindle positioning. cooperation between these two evolutionarily-conserved cell polarity pathways could have important implications to both the development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis in animals. the family of membrane-associated guanylate kinase (maguk) scaffold proteins comprises members that function at neuronal synapses, tight junctions, immunological synapses, and neutrophil membranes. through their multiple domains, maguks organize events of signal transduction, cell adhesion, and molecular trafficking. here, we use nuclear magnetic resonance, small-angle x-ray scattering, and rosetta modeling to reveal the structural preferences and interdomain dynamics of the maguk core (pdz3-sh3-guanylate kinase) from postsynaptic density-95 (psd-95), the best known maugk. psd-95 is highly abundant in the postsynaptic density of excitatory neurons and is responsible for coupling glutamate receptors with internal postsynaptic structures. these solution-based studies show that the maguk core pdz domain (pdz3) interacts directly with the sh3 domain via its canonical peptide binding groove, with the connecting linker serving as an adhesive. this weak interaction, however, is dynamic and weakened further by pdz3 ligands and linker phosphorylation, suggesting that domain dynamics may be central to maguk function.
the evolutionary origins of the hypoxia-sensitive cells that trigger amniote respiratory reflexes – carotid body glomus cells, and ‘pulmonary neuroendocrine cells’ (pnecs) - are obscure. homology has been proposed between glomus cells, which are neural crest-derived, and the hypoxia-sensitive ‘neuroepithelial cells’ (necs) of fish gills, whose embryonic origin is unknown. necs have also been likened to pnecs, which differentiate in situ within lung airway epithelia. using genetic lineage-tracing and neural crest-deficient mutants in zebrafish, and physical fate-mapping in frog and lamprey, we find that necs are not neural crest-derived, but endoderm-derived, like pnecs, whose endodermal origin we confirm. we discover neural crest-derived catecholaminergic cells associated with zebrafish pharyngeal arch blood vessels, and propose a new model for amniote hypoxia-sensitive cell evolution: endoderm-derived necs were retained as pnecs, while the carotid body evolved via the aggregation of neural crest-derived catecholaminergic (chromaffin) cells already associated with blood vessels in anamniote pharyngeal arches. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.21231.001 visualizing the beginnings of melanoma in cancer biology, a tumor begins from a single cell within a group of precancerous cells that share genetic mutations. kaufman et al. used a zebrafish melanoma model to visualize cancer initiation (see the perspective by boumahdi and blanpain). they used a fluorescent reporter that specifically lit up neural crest progenitors that are only present during embryogenesis or during adult melanoma tumor formation. the appearance of this tumor correlated with a set of gene regulatory elements, called super-enhancers, whose identification and manipulation may prove beneficial in detecting and preventing melanoma initiation. science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad2197; see also p. 453 melanocytes with oncogenic or tumor suppressor mutations revert to expressing the crestin gene early in melanoma formation. [also see perspective by boumahdi and blanpain] introduction the “cancerized field” concept posits that cells in a given tissue sharing an oncogenic mutation are cancer-prone, yet only discreet clones within the field initiate tumors. studying the process of cancer initiation has remained challenging because of (i) the rarity of these events, (ii) the difficulty of visiualizing initiating clones in living organisms, and (iii) the transient nature of a newly transformed clone emerging before it expands to form an early tumor. a more complete understanding of the molecular processes that regulate cancer initiation could provide important prognostic information about which precancerous lesions are most prone to becoming cancer and also implicate druggable molecular pathways that, when inhibited, may prevent the cancer from ever starting. rationale the majority of benign nevi carry oncogenic brafv600e mutations and can be considered a cancerized field of melanocytes, but they only rarely convert to melanoma. in an effort to define events that initiate cancer, we used a melanoma model in the zebrafish in which the human brafv600e oncogene is driven by the melanocyte-specific mitfa promoter. when bred into a p53 mutant background, these fish develop melanoma tumors over the course of many months. the zebrafish crestin gene is expressed embryonically in neural crest progenitors (ncps) and is specifically reexpressed only in melanoma tumors, making it an ideal candidate for tracking melanoma from initiation onward. results we developed a crestin:egfp reporter that recapitulates the embryonic neural crest expression pattern of crestin and its expression in melanoma tumors. we show through live imaging of transgenic zebrafish crestin reporters that within a cancerized field (brafv600e-mutant; p53-deficient), a single melanocyte reactivates the ncp state, and this establishes that a fate change occurs at melanoma initiation in this model. early crestin+ patches of cells expand and are transplantable in a manner consistent with their possessing tumorigenic activity, and they exhibit a gene expression pattern consistent with the ncp identity readout by the crestin reporter. the crestin element is regulated by ncp transcription factors, including sox10. forced sox10 overexpression in melanocytes accelerated melanoma formation, whereas crispr/cas9 targeting of sox10 delayed melanoma onset. we show activation of super-enhancers at ncp genes in both zebrafish and human melanomas, identifying an epigenetic mechanism for control of this ncp signature leading to melanoma. conclusion this work using our zebrafish melanoma model and in vivo reporter of ncp identity allows us to see cancer from its birth as a single cell and shows the importance of ncp-state reemergence as a key event in melanoma initiation from a field of cancer-prone melanocytes. thus, in addition to the typical fixed genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor supressors that are required for cancer development, the reemergence of progenitor identity may be an additional rate-limiting step in the formation of melanoma. preventing ncp reemergence in a field of cancer-prone melanocytes may thus prove therapeutically useful, and the association of ncp genes with super-enhancer regulatory elements implicates the associated druggable epigenetic machinery in this process. neural crest reporter expression in melanoma. the crestin:egfp transgene is specifically expressed in melanoma in brafv600e/p53 mutant melanoma-prone zebrafish. (top) a single cell expressing crestin:egfp expands into a small patch of cells over the course of 2 weeks, capturing the initiation of melanoma formation (bracket). (bottom) a fully formed melanoma specifically expresses crestin:egfp, whereas the rest of the fish remains egfp-negative. the “cancerized field” concept posits that cancer-prone cells in a given tissue share an oncogenic mutation, but only discreet clones within the field initiate tumors. most benign nevi carry oncogenic brafv600e mutations but rarely become melanoma. the zebrafish crestin gene is expressed embryonically in neural crest progenitors (ncps) and specifically reexpressed in melanoma. live imaging of transgenic zebrafish crestin reporters shows that within a cancerized field (brafv600e-mutant; p53-deficient), a single melanocyte reactivates the ncp state, revealing a fate change at melanoma initiation in this model. ncp transcription factors, including sox10, regulate crestin expression. forced sox10 overexpression in melanocytes accelerated melanoma formation, which is consistent with activation of ncp genes and super-enhancers leading to melanoma. our work highlights ncp state reemergence as a key event in melanoma initiation.
optical fiber-based mapping systems are used to record the cardiac action potential (ap) throughout the myocardium. the optical ap contains a contraction-induced motion artifact (ma), which makes it difficult to accurately measure the action potential duration (apd). ma is removed by preventing contraction with electrical-mechanical uncoupling drugs, such as 2,3-butanedione monoxime (bdm). we designed a novel fiber-based ratiometric optical channel using a blue light emitting diode, a diffraction grating, and a split photodetector that can accurately measure the cardiac ap without the need for bdm. the channel was designed based on simulations using the optical design software zemax. the channel has an electrical bandwidth of 150 hz and an root mean-square dark noise of 742 muv. the channel successfully recorded the cardiac ap from the wall of five rabbit heart preparations without the use of bdm. after 20-point median filtering, the mean signal/noise ratio was 25.3 v/v. the apd measured from the base of a rabbit heart was 134 +/- 8.4 ms, compared to 137.6 +/- 3.3 ms from simultaneous microelectrode recordings. this difference was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.3). the quantity of ma removed was also measured using the motion ratio. the reduction in ma was significant (p-value = 0.0001). this fiber-based system is the first of its kind to enable optical apd measurements in the beating heart wall without the use of bdm. transmembrane voltage-sensitive fluorescence measurements are limited by baseline drift that can obscure changes in resting membrane potential and by motion artifacts that can obscure repolarization. voltage-dependent shift of emission wavelengths may allow reduction of drift and motion artifacts by emission ratiometry. we have tested this for action potentials and potassium-induced changes in resting membrane potential in rabbit hearts stained with di-4-anepps [pyridinium, 4-(2-(6-(dibutylamino)-2-naphthalenyl) ethenyl)-1-(3-sulfopropyl)-, hydroxide, inner salt] using laser excitation (488 nm) and a two-photomultiplier tube system or spectrofluorometer (resolution of 500-1,000 hz and <1 mm). green and red emissions produced upright and inverted action potentials, respectively. ratios of green emission to red emission followed action potential contours and exhibited larger fractional changes than either emission alone (p < 0.001). the largest changes and signal-to-noise ratio (signal/noise) were obtained with numerator wavelengths of 525-550 nm and denominator wavelengths of 650-700 nm. ratiometry lessened drift 56-66% (p < 0.015) and indicated decreases in resting membrane potential. ratiometry lessened motion artifacts and increased magnitudes of deflections representing phase-zero depolarizations relative to total deflections by 123-188% in intact hearts (p < 0.02). durations of action potentials at different pacing rates, temperatures, and potassium concentrations were independent of whether they were measured ratiometrically or with microelectrodes (p > or = 0.65). the ratiometric calibration slope was 0.017/100 mv and decreased with time. thus emission ratiometry lessens the effects of motion and drift and indicates resting membrane potential changes and repolarization.
abstractpurposethe purpose of this study was to analyse the clinical outcomes of multiligament injured knees with respect to the medial collateral ligament and posteromedial corner (pmc) repair or reconstruction versus the posterolateral corner (plc) reconstruction in patients operated according to a codified surgical protocol. methodspatients were divided into two groups depending on whether pmc or plc was injured. cruciate ligaments as well as pmc or plc were reconstructed/repaired in a one-stage procedure. at minimum of 1-year follow-up, objective and subjective international knee documentation committee (ikdc) forms, lysholm score and sports activity level were recorded.resultsthirty-nine patients with a median follow-up time of 57 months (range 12–129) were reviewed. no significant difference was found for functional scores between acute pmc and plc subgroups. in group plc, subjective outcomes tend to be better in the acute than in chronic reconstruction subgroup.conclusionsa one-stage protocol with early surgery rather than delayed reconstruction produced better clinical outcomes whatever the injured collateral ligament, medial or lateral. in the future, early and chronic reconstructions as well as each injury pattern should be considered as separate entities in studies on multiple ligament injured knees to reach a better level of evidence.level of evidenceiv. medial-sided knee injuries can result in pain, instability, and loss of function. many clinical studies have been written on the treatment of medial-sided knee injuries; however, the vast majority are isolated case series of surgical or nonoperative treatment regimens, and only a few randomized prospective clinical trials can be found in the literature that compare different treatment modalities. comparison of these treatments is challenging due to the variety of medial-sided structures that can be involved, the multiple different approaches to treatment, and the variability of how objective and subjective clinical outcomes are reported. in this paper we report on the injuries by extent and type of anatomic structures damaged including partial medial-sided injuries, completed isolated medial-sided knee injuries, and combined injuries. in general, most authors concur that isolated partial or complete medial collateral ligament (mcl) injuries can be treated nonoperatively with a brace and early motion with good clinical outcomes. prospective, randomized trials support nonoperative treatment of the mcl in combined anterior cruciate ligament-mcl injuries. knee dislocations and posterior medial corner injuries appear to have better results with surgical management including reconstruction. multiple reconstructive techniques have been described for chronic injuries but it is difficult to compare their results.
a total of 26 healthy volunteers participated in this randomized 4-leg crossover study designed to measure fluoride (f) retention in interdental plaque and saliva. two naf dentifrices (5,000 and 1,450 ppm f) were used, with and without postbrushing water rinsing. the 4 tooth brushing methods were carried out twice a day during 2 weeks. interdental plaque was collected from all proximal sites after each method, using dental floss. immediately after the plaque sampling, the subjects were asked to brush their teeth with the same toothpaste and use the postbrushing water rinsing procedure as previously. proximal saliva was collected from 4 interdental sites, using small paper points, before and up to 60 min after the brushing. the present study showed that the 5,000 ppm f toothpaste without postbrushing water rinsing resulted in the highest f concentration in both plaque and saliva and the 1,450 ppm f toothpaste with water rinsing in the lowest. the difference in the area under the curve of saliva f concentration versus time between the 2 methods was 4.2 times (p < 0.001). the corresponding difference in f concentration per unit weight of plaque (n = 16) was 2.75 times (p < 0.05). water rinsing immediately after tooth brushing with 5,000 ppm reduced the f concentration in saliva by 2.4 times (p < 0.001). the difference in f values in saliva between 5,000/rinsing and 1,450/no rinsing was minor and not significant. the increase of f in both proximal saliva and plaque, using a dentifrice with 5,000 ppm f without postbrushing water rinsing, may be of clinical importance. the aim of this paper was to describe what experts of today believe are the main reasons explaining the caries decline seen in many westernized countries over the past 3 decades. we have collected the views of a number of international experts, trying to answer the specific question "what are the main reasons why 20-25-year-old persons have less caries nowadays, compared to 30 years ago?". a questionnaire was mailed to 55 experts with a number of thinkable explanations to be scored according to a predetermined scale. the 25 items were divided into main groups under the heading of diet, fluorides, plaque, saliva, dentist/dental materials and other factors. the experts were asked to think of a specific country or area, and also to specify whether the chosen area had water fluoridation or not. the main finding of our study, based on a 95% response rate, was that there is a very large variation in how the experts graded the impact of various possible factors. for the use of fluoride toothpaste, there was a clear agreement of a definite positive effect.
early institutional care can be profoundly stressful for the human infant, and, as such, can lead to significant alterations in brain development. in animal models, similar variants of early adversity have been shown to modify amygdala–hippocampal–prefrontal cortex development and associated aversive learning. the current study examined this rearing aberration in human development. eighty-nine children and adolescents who were either previously institutionalized (pi youth; n = 46; 33 females and 13 males; age range, 7–16 years) or were raised by their biological parents from birth (n = 43; 22 females and 21 males; age range, 7–16 years) completed an aversive-learning paradigm while undergoing functional neuroimaging, wherein visual cues were paired with either an aversive sound (cs+) or no sound (cs−). for the pi youth, better aversive learning was associated with higher concurrent trait anxiety. both groups showed robust learning and amygdala activation for cs+ versus cs− trials. however, pi youth also exhibited broader recruitment of several regions and increased hippocampal connectivity with prefrontal cortex. stronger connectivity between the hippocampus and ventromedial pfc predicted significant improvements in future anxiety (measured 2 years later), and this was particularly true within the pi group. these results suggest that for humans as well as for other species, early adversity alters the neurobiology of aversive learning by engaging a broader prefrontal–subcortical circuit than same-aged peers. these differences are interpreted as ontogenetic adaptations and potential sources of resilience. significance statement prior institutionalization is a significant form of early adversity. while nonhuman animal research suggests that early adversity alters aversive learning and associated neurocircuitry, no prior work has examined this in humans. here, we show that youth who experienced prior institutionalization, but not comparison youth, recruit the hippocampus during aversive learning. among youth who experienced prior institutionalization, individual differences in aversive learning were associated with worse current anxiety. however, connectivity between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex prospectively predicted significant improvements in anxiety 2 years following scanning for previously institutionalized youth. among youth who experienced prior institutionalization, age-atypical engagement of a distributed set of brain regions during aversive learning may serve a protective function. development of anxiety disorders is associated with neurobiological changes in areas that are a critical part of the fear neurocircuitry. fear conditioning paradigms can offer insight into the mechanisms underlying the neurobiological ontogeny of anxiety. a small number of studies have focused on the effects of age and anxiety separately in school age children. the present study aimed to investigate these effects in 8-13 year old children with higher and lower trait anxiety. we examined differential fear conditioning and extinction using skin conductance responses and fear-potentiated startle in 60 children recruited from a low-income urban population. the results indicated that children under 10 years of age show poor discrimination of conditioned stimuli, and that anxiety increases fear responses during fear acquisition. after controlling for age and trauma exposure, fear-potentiated startle to the safety cue predicted child anxiety levels suggesting that impaired safety signal learning may be a risk factor for anxiety disorders in adulthood. identifying risk phenotypes in children may provide opportunities for early intervention and prevention of illness.
objective alpha-fetoprotein (afp) is an important tumor marker for non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (nsgcts) that greatly affects diagnosis and the evaluations of therapy and therapeutic policy. however, it is sometimes very difficult to make the distinction between tumors and falsely elevated afp levels due to benign liver disease. we assessed the usefulness of lectin-reactive alpha-fetoprotein (afp-l3%), which has been reported to be superior to total afp in both sensitivity and specificity in hepatocellular carcinomas, for the evaluation of predictions of clinical courses after the treatment of nsgcts. methods frozen sera of 25 tumor-bearing patients with testicular cancers whose afp levels were 5.0 ng/ml or higher were used. the total afp levels and the ratio of l3 fraction to total afp (afp-l3%) were measured by liquid-phase binding assay (lba). results the total afp levels were 6.3-14 907 ng/ml (median: 105.9 ng/ml). the median afp-l3% was 69.9% (range;: 1.1-88.1%). except for one patient, 24 patients (96.0%) with evident disease showed high levels of afp-l3% of >50%, regardless of their total afp levels. in nine patients whose sera were sequentially measured, afp-l3% was considered highly useful for the detection of residual tumors (n = 2) and recurrence (n = 1) and for the exclusion of false-positive cases (n = 1). conclusions when the total afp level increases slightly (e.g. to 5-20 ng/ml), a measurement of afp-l3% may provide additional useful information for monitoring nsgct patients and in distinguishing falsely elevated afp. we report false elevations of serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels in 4 patients with testicular germ cell tumors. elevated circulating luteinizing hormone levels that resulted from unilateral orchiectomy were responsible for the falsely positive human chorionic gonadotropin activity measured in commercial radioimmunoassays. in 3 patients tested aliquots of serum evaluated in reliable human chorionic gonadotropin assay systems revealed no elevation. we administered testosterone to 3 patients who had elevations of luteinizing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin levels. luteinizing hormone was suppress-d to normal levels 1 week later in 2 patients and in 1 it was diminished but still slightly elevated. in all 3 cases the falsely positive human chorionic gonadotropin results converted to negative. recognition of falsely positive elevations of human chorionic gonadotropin can spare patients unnecessary operations and/or chemotherapy.
granulocytes play a key role in the defense against invading pathogens. to study granulocyte functions, the isolation of a pure and active cell population from fresh blood is required. anticoagulants and red blood cells (rbcs) lysis used in the isolation procedure may influence cell harvest, cell marker expression, and pre-activation of cells. in this study, the influence of the anticoagulants k3edta or lithium heparin and the effect of different rbcs lysis methods on bovine granulocyte population from fresh blood of healthy cows after density gradient centrifugation were investigated. venous blood from healthy cows was collected in k3edta and lithium heparin tubes. density gradient centrifugation to separate granulocytes from other cells was conducted using biocoll. then, rbcs were lysed with hypotonic water or 0.2% sodium chloride (nacl). immediately after isolation, harvest, viability, size, granularity, purity, and cd11b expression as a marker for granulocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry. in addition, as a marker for activation and reactivity of the granulocytes, we stimulated cells with phorbol-myristate-acetate to evaluate the release of reactive oxygen species. furthermore, extracellular trap (et) formation was investigated by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in untreated control cells and cells treated with the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin. we did not find a significant difference in percentage of dead cells when comparing the two anticoagulants or the different rbcs lysis methods. however, the percentage of granulocytes in the harvested population was significantly less using lithium heparin blood as anticoagulant compared to k3edta. the granulocytes harvested from lithium heparin blood and water lysis exhibited higher clumping and pre-activation of unstimulated control cells as indicated by isolation of doublet cells, increased cd11b expression, and increased oxidative burst and higher amount of et-releasing cells. furthermore, the combination of k3edta as anticoagulant and nacl as rbcs lysis method revealed the lowest variability and highest difference between untreated and methyl-β-cyclodextrin-treated cells when quantifying et formation. in conclusion, density gradient centrifugation of k3edta blood resulted in higher purity of bovine granulocytes compared to lithium heparin blood. in contrast to water lysis, nacl lysis method is recommended to avoid pre-activation of cells which may occur during hypotonic water lysis. neutrophils play a key role in initiating an innate immune response, being the first type of immune cell arriving at the site of injury or infection. these cells are able to mount a direct anti-bactericidal response by the production of reactive oxygen or reactive nitrogen species (ros/rns). an important component of the host innate immune response is recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) by pattern recognition receptors (prrs). toll-like receptors (tlrs) are an important family of prrs and, are a key component in activation of innate immune mechanisms. in the present study we described the presence of mrna transcripts for tlr1, tlr2, tlr4, tlr6, tlr7 and tlr10 in bovine neutrophils. in contrast, the presence of mrna transcripts for tlr3 varied between animals, whereas no transcripts were detected for tlr5, tlr8, tlr9 or the c-type lectin receptor dectin-1 in neutrophils isolated from bovine blood. additionally, zymosan, a dectin-1/tlr2 ligand, induced ros, but not rns production in a cd11b-, but not dectin-1-dependent manner. this effect was dependent on store operated calcium entry (soce), and partially inhibited using monoclonal antibodies to cd11b. taken together, our data describe the presence of specific prrs transcripts in the mrna isolated from bovine neutrophil and show a cd11b-/ca(2+) dependent ros production by these cells.
there is a growing body of evidence that wilms' tumor protein 1 (wt1) is a promising tumor antigen for the development of a novel class of universal cancer vaccines. recently, in a national cancer institute prioritization project, wt1 was ranked first in a list of 75 cancer antigens. in this light, we exhaustively reviewed all published cancer vaccine trials reporting on wt1-targeted active specific immunotherapy in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors. in all clinical trials, vaccine-induced immunological responses could be detected. importantly, objective clinical responses (including stable disease) were observed in 46% and 64% of evaluable vaccinated patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies, respectively. immunogenicity of wt1-based cancer vaccines was demonstrated by the detection of a specific immunological response in 35% and 68% of evaluable patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies, respectively. in order to become part of the armamentarium of the modern oncologist, it will be important to design wt1-based immunotherapies applicable to a large patient population, to standardize vaccination protocols enabling systematic review, and to further optimize the immunostimulatory capacity of the vaccine components. moreover, improved immunomonitoring tools that reveal clinically relevant t-cell responses will further shape the ideal wt1 immunotherapy strategy. in conclusion, the clinical results obtained so far in wt1-targeted cancer vaccine trials reveal an untapped potential for inducing cancer immunity with minimal side effects and hold promise for a new adjuvant treatment against residual disease and against cancer relapse. the wild-type wilms tumor gene, wt1, is overexpressed in myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) as well as acute myeloid leukemia. in a phase i clinical trial of biweekly vaccination with hla-a*2402-restricted wt1 peptide for these malignancies, 2 patients with mds developed severe leukocytopenia in association with a reduction in leukemic blast cells and levels of wt1 messenger rna (mrna) after only a single vaccination with 0.3 mg of wt1 peptide. these results indicated that the wt1-specific cytotoxic t-lymphocytes (ctls) elicited by wt1 vaccination eradicated the wt1-expressing transformed stem or progenitor cells and that mds patients with little normal hematopoiesis required a new strategy of wt1 vaccination to avoid severe leukocytopenia. we describe the first trial for a 57-year-old male patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia who was vaccinated biweekly with a small quantity (5 microg/body) of wt1 peptide. after the start of vaccination, the leukocyte and monocyte counts (13,780/microl and 1930/microl, respectively) gradually decreased to within the normal range in association with a reduction in the wt1 mrna level. simultaneously, the percentage of wt1-specific ctls as measured by the hla-wt1 tetramer assay increased. this case demonstrates for the first time that vaccination with as little as 5 microg of wt1 peptide can induce wt1-specific immune responses and resultant clinical responses.
abstract the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria poses a serious threat to human health. bacteria often acquire resistance from a mutation of chromosomal genes during therapy. we have recently shown that the evolution of resistance to ciprofloxacin in vivo and in vitro requires the induction of a mutation that is mediated by the cleavage of the sos repressor lexa and the associated derepression of three specialized dna polymerases (polymerase ii [pol ii], pol iv, and pol v). these results led us to suggest that it may be possible to design drugs to inhibit these proteins and that such drugs might be coadministered with antibiotics to prevent mutation and the evolution of resistance. for the approach to be feasible, there must not be any mechanisms through which bacteria can induce mutations and acquire antibiotic resistance that are independent of lexa and its repressed polymerases. perhaps the most commonly cited mechanism to elevate bacterial mutation rates is the inactivation of methyl-directed mismatch repair (mmr). however, it is unclear whether this represents a lexa-independent mechanism or if the mutations that arise in mmr-deficient hypermutator strains are also dependent on lexa cleavage and polymerase derepression. in this work, we show that lexa cleavage and polymerase derepression are required for the evolution of clinically significant resistance in mmr-defective escherichia coli. thus, drugs that inhibit the proteins responsible for induced mutations are expected to efficiently prevent the evolution of resistance, even in mmr-deficient hypermutator strains. the incidence of emergent resistance and clinical factors affecting its development were evaluated by retrospective review of 173 studies encompassing over 14,000 patients. eight antibiotic classes and 225 individual treatment regimens were evaluated. emergent resistance occurred among 4.0% of all organisms and 5.6% of all infections treated. it appeared to be significantly more frequent with penicillin and aminoglycoside monotherapy, with significantly lower rates associated with imipenem‐cilastatin, aztreonam, and combination therapy. clinical failure also appeared to be significantly more likely to occur after emergence of resistance among organisms treated with fluoroquinolones or aminoglycosides. infections associated with higher resistance rates were cystic fibrosis, osteomyelitis, and lower respiratory tract infections. resistance was most common in patients in intensive care units or receiving mechanical ventilation. it was also significantly frequent among studies performed in university or teaching hospitals. organisms associated with high resistance rates were pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia, enterobacter, and acinetobacter sp. factors such as infection type, underlying diseases, type of institution, and specific pathogens warrant consideration when examining emergent resistance.
natural killer (nk) cells have important functions in immunity. nk recognition in mammals can be mediated through killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (kir) and/or killer cell lectin-like ly49 receptors. genes encoding highly variable nk cell receptors (nkr) represent rapidly evolving genomic regions. no single conservative model of nkr genes was observed in mammals. single-copy low polymorphic nkr genes present in one mammalian species may expand into highly polymorphic multigene families in other species. in contrast to other non-rodent mammals, multiple ly49-like genes appear to exist in the horse, while no functional kir genes were observed in this species. in this study, ly49 and kir were sought and their evolution was characterized in the entire family equidae. genomic sequences retrieved showed the presence of at least five highly conserved polymorphic ly49 genes in horses, asses and zebras. these findings confirmed that the expansion of ly49 occurred in the entire family. several kir-like sequences were also identified in the genome of equids. besides a previously identified non-functional kir-immunoglobulin-like transcript fusion gene (kir-ilta) and two putative pseudogenes, a kir3dl-like sequence was analyzed. in contrast to previous observations made in the horse, the kir3dl sequence, genomic organization and mrna expression suggest that all equids might produce a functional kir receptor protein molecule with a single non-mutated immune tyrosine-based inhibition motif (itim) domain. no evidence for positive selection in the kir3dl gene was found. phylogenetic analysis including rhinoceros and tapir genomic dna and deduced amino acid kir-related sequences showed differences between families and even between species within the order perissodactyla. the results suggest that the order perissodactyla and its family equidae with expanded ly49 genes and with a potentially functional kir gene may represent an interesting model for evolutionary biology of nkr genes. problem: equine chorionic girdle cells are a subpopulation of highly invasive trophoblast cells that attach and invade the uterine epithelium on day 35 (day 0 = day of ovulation). these invading chorionic girdle cells form endometrial cups that are associated with a marked local maternal leukocytic response that may result in the demise of the cups at day 120 of pregnancy. once endometrial cups become established in the uterine wall they do not express mhc antigens, and therefore may only be susceptible to non‐mhc restricted cytotoxic cells. the susceptibility of cultured chorionic girdle cells to lak cell cytotoxicity was tested in order to evaluate the role of this type of cytotoxicity in the life‐cycle of endometrial cup tissue.
two distinct areas of cerebellar cortex, vermal lobule vii and the dorsal paraflocculus (dpfl) receive visual input. to help understand the visuomotor functions of these two regions, we compared their afferent and efferent connections using the tracers wheatgerm agglutinin horseradish peroxidase (wga-hrp) and biotinilated dextran amine (bda). the sources of both mossy fibre and climbing fibre input to the two areas are different. the main mossy fibre input to lobule vii is from the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (nrtp), which relays visual information from the superior colliculus, while the main mossy fibre input to the dpfl is from the pontine nuclei, relaying information from cortical visual areas. the dpfl and lobule vii both also receive mossy fibre input from several common brainstem regions, but from different subsets of cells. these include visual input from the dorsolateral pons, and vestibular–oculomotor input from the medial vestibular nucleus (mve) and the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (nph). the climbing fibre input to the two cerebellar regions is from different subdivisions of the inferior olivary nuclei. climbing fibres from the caudal medial accessory olive (cmao) project to lobule vii, while the rostral mao (rmao) and the principal olive (po) project to the dpfl. the efferent projections from lobule vii and the dpf1 are to all of the recognised oculomotor and visual areas within the deep cerebellar nuclei, but to separate territories. both regions play a role in eye movement control. the dpfl may also have a role in visually guided reaching. summaryfollowing small lesions of the first sensorimotor (msi) and second somatosensory (sii) cortical areas the ensuing degeneration in the inferior olives was studied with the nauta method in 14 cats.no convincing signs of degeneration were found in the olives in cases with lesions restricted to the first and second somatosensory areas (si and sii). following lesions of the primary “motor” cortex (anterior sigmoid gyrus and rostral part of the coronal gyrus) degeneration was consistently found in the olive of both sides. the contralateral projection is somewhat more abundant than the ipsilateral, but both are modest.degeneration is restricted to certain parts of the olivary complex (see fig. 11). lesions restricted to different somatotopical subdivisions of the primary “motor” cortex give rise to degeneration distributed in a somatotopical pattern in certain areas of the medial and dorsal accessory olives and the rostral part of the ventral lamella. somatotopical patterns could not be established in the smaller projections to some other minor olivary regions.when the findings are correlated with the pattern of the olivocerebellar projection it can be concluded that there is a somatotopically organized direct corticoolivo-cerebellar pathway to the intermediate part of the anterior lobe, the posterior vermis and the crus ii.attempts to correlate the findings with physiological observations are difficult. it appears that the current view that climbing fibres arise only in the olive may need revision. the role of the pontine nuclei in mediating somatotopically localized cerebellocerebellar impulses appears to have been underestimated.
nad(p)h quinone oxidoreductase is a ubiquitous enzyme that is known to directly reduce quinone substrates to hydroquinones by a two-electron reaction. we report the identification of nadph quinone oxidoreductase from kluyveromyces marxianus (kmqor), which reduces quinone substrates directly to hydroquinones. the kmqor gene was sequenced, expressed in escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. the open-reading frame of the kmqor gene consists of 1143 nucleotides, encoding a 380 amino acid polypeptide. the nucleotide sequence of the kmqor gene was assigned to embl under accession number ay040868. the m(r) that was determined by sds-page for the protein subunit was about 42 kda, and the molecular mass of the native kmqor was 84 kda, as determined by column calibration, indicating that the native protein is a homodimer. the kmqor protein efficiently reduced 1,4-benzoquinone, whereas no activities were found for menadiones and methoxyquinones. these observations, and the result of an extended sequence analysis of known nadph quinone oxidoreductase, suggest that kmqor possesses a different action mechanism. dt-diaphorase, also referred to as nqo1 or nad(p)h: quinone acceptor oxidoreductase, is a flavoprotein that catalyzes the two-electron reduction of quinones and quinonoid compounds to hydroquinones, using either nadh or nadph as the electron donor. nrh (dihydronicotinamide riboside): quinone oxidoreductase, also referred to as nqo2, has a high nucleotide sequence identity to dt-diaphorase and is considered to be an isozyme of dt-diaphorase. these enzymes transfer two electrons to a quinone, resulting in the formation of a hydroquinone product without the accumulation of a dissociated semiquinone. steady and rapid-reaction kinetic experiments have been performed to determine the reaction mechanism of dt-diaphorase. furthermore, chimeric and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have been performed to determine the molecular basis of the catalytic differences between the two isozymes and to identify the critical amino acid residues that interact with various inhibitors of the enzymes. in addition, functional studies of a natural occurring mutant pro-187 to ser (p187s) have been carried out. results obtained from these investigations are summarized and discussed.
backgroundintelligence is related to both height and body mass index (bmi) at various stages of life. several studies have demonstrated longitudinal relationships between these measures, but none has established whether height and intelligence, or bmi and intelligence are linked from childhood through to older age.methodswe assessed the relations between these measures over an interval of up to 67 years using data from the 36-day sample, an initially-representative sample of scottish people born in 1936, assessed at age 11 years (n = 6,291) and again at 77–78 years (n = 722). this paper focuses on the 423 participants (6.7 % of the original sample) who provided relevant data in late adulthood.resultsheight and intelligence were significantly positively associated in childhood (β = .23) and late adulthood (β = .21–.29). longitudinal correlations also showed that childhood intelligence predicted late-adulthood height (β = .20), and childhood height predicted late-adulthood cognitive ability (β = .12–.14). we observed no significant relationship between bmi and intelligence either in childhood or in late adulthood, nor any longitudinal association between the two in this sample.conclusionsour results on height and intelligence are the first to demonstrate that their relationship spans almost seven decades, from childhood through to late adulthood, and they call for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying this lifelong association. the association between lifelong body mass index (bmi) and cognitive function has not been comprehensively studied.
a simulation-based evolutionary optimization is proposed for a parallel processor system.a lower level monte carlo and an upper level differential evolution are suggested.simulation is used to assess quality of candidate solutions and optimizer is utilized to guide the search at upper level.chaos theory is employed to enhance quality of results via preventing premature convergence and locality. one of the main limitation of the application of evolutionary algorithms (ea) is the tendency to converge prematurely to a local optimum. the eas suffer with the disadvantage of premature convergence and hence the study on convergence of eas is always one of the most important research fields. due to outstanding capability of chaos to avoid being trapped in local optimum, it can be considered as an efficient search tool. therefore, in current paper, in order to taking properties of chaos, eight chaotic maps are employed within a differential evolution (de) algorithm for solving a stochastic job scheduling problem. to speedup searching and avoid local optimum traps, the random sequences produced from chaotic maps are utilized instead of random variables in de. furthermore, to address the uncertainties arising in scheduling environments, monte carlo simulation is used. however, simulation is not an optimization approach. therefore, we design the simulation-based optimization approach where a simulator is combined with chaotic de. the simulation experiments are used to evaluate the quality of candidate solutions and the chaotic de is utilized to find best-compromised solutions and then guide the search direction. the performance of simulation-based chaotic de algorithm is investigated in a computational study, and the results show the outperformance of suggested method with respect to the traditional methods. this paper presents an application-specific, heterogeneous multiprocessor synthesis system, named hemps, that combines a form of evolutionary computation known as differential evolution with a scheduling heuristic to search the design space efficiently. we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by comparing it to similar existing systems. the proposed strategy is shown to be faster than recent systems on large problems while providing equivalent or improved final solutions.
we show that treatment of a panel of thyroid carcinoma cell lines naturally harboring the ret/ptc1 oncogene, with the ret kinase inhibitors pp1 and zd6474, results in reversible g1 arrest. this is accompanied by interruption of shc and mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) phosphorylation, reduced levels of g1 cyclins, and increased levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 because of a reduced protein turnover. map/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 inhibition by u0126 caused g1 cyclins down-regulation and p27kip1 up-regulation as well. forced expression of ret/ptc in normal thyroid follicular cells caused a mapk- and proteasome-dependent down-regulation of p27kip1. reduction of p27kip1 protein levels by antisense oligonucleotides abrogated the g1 arrest induced by ret/ptc blockade. therefore, in thyroid cancer, ret/ptc-mediated mapk activation contributes to p27kip1 deregulation. this pathway is implicated in cell cycle progression and in response to small molecule kinase inhibitors. according to current concepts, the cell cycle commitment after restriction (r) point passage requires the sustained stimulation by mitogens of the synthesis of labile d-type cyclins, which associate with cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 4/6 to phosphorylate prb family proteins and sequester the cdk inhibitor p27kip1. in primary cultures of dog thyroid epithelial cells, the camp-dependent cell cycle induced by a sustained stimulation by thyrotropin or forskolin differs from growth factor mitogenic pathways, as camp does not upregulate d-type cyclins but increases p27 levels. instead, camp induces the assembly of required cyclin d3-cdk4 complexes, which associate with nuclear p27. in this study, the arrest of forskolin stimulation rapidly slowed down the entry of dog thyrocytes into s phase and the phosphorylation of prb family proteins. the prb kinase activity, but not the formation, of the cyclin d3-cdk4-p27 complex was strongly reduced. using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, a phosphorylated form of cdk4 was separated. it appeared in response to forskolin and was bound to both cyclin d3 and p27, presumably reflecting the activating thr-172 phosphorylation of cdk4. upon forskolin withdrawal or after cycloheximide addition, this cdk4 phosphoform unexpectedly persisted in p27 complexes devoid of cyclin d3 but it disappeared from the more labile cyclin d3 complexes. these data demonstrate that the assembly of the cyclin d3-cdk4-p27 holoenzyme and the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of cdk4 depend on distinct camp actions. this provides a first example of a crucial regulation of cdk4 phosphorylation by a mitogenic cascade and a novel mechanism of cell cycle control at the r point.
excess of free iron is thought to harm plant cells by enhancing the intracellular production of reactive oxygen intermediates (roi). cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (capx) is an iron-containing, roi-detoxifying enzyme induced in response to iron overload or oxidative stress. we studied the expression of capx in leaves of de-rooted bean plants in response to iron overload. capx expression, i.e., mrna and protein, was rapidly induced in response to iron overload. this induction correlated with the increase in iron content in leaves and occurred in the light as well as in the dark. reduced glutathione (gsh), which plays an important role in activating the roi signal transduction pathway as well as in roi detoxification, was found to enhance the induction of apx mrna by iron. to determine whether capx induction during iron overload was due to an increase in the amount of free iron, which serves as a co-factor for capx synthesis, or due to iron-mediated increase in roi production, we tested the expression of apx in leaves under low oxygen pressure. this treatment, which suppresses the formation of roi, completely abolished the induction of capx mrna during iron overload, without affecting the rate of iron uptake by plants. taken together, our results suggest that high intracellular levels of free iron in plants lead to the enhanced production of roi, which in turn induces the expression of capx, possibly using gsh as an intermediate signal. we further show, using capx-antisense transgenic plants, that capx expression is essential to prevent iron-mediated tissue damage in tobacco. a gene encoding cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (apxi) from pea (pisum sativum l.) was isolated and its nucleotide sequence determined. by homologous alignment between the apxi cdna (mittler, r., and zilinskas, b. (1991) febs lett. 289, 257-259) and the genomic clone, positions of introns and exons were determined. the isolated apxi gene was found to contain 9 introns, the first of which was located within the 5'-untranslated region of the mrna. southern blot analysis of pea genomic dna suggests that in pea cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase is encoded by a single copy gene. steady state apxi transcript levels were found to increase in response to several stresses imposed by drought, heat, and application of ethephon, abscisic acid, and the superoxide-generating agent paraquat. increases in ascorbate peroxidase activity in response to stresses were less marked than changes observed in transcript levels; cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase protein levels measured by immunoblot analysis remained unchanged.
advances in genome-wide molecular cytogenetics allow identification of novel submicroscopic dna copy number alterations (acnas) and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnloh) resulting in homozygosity for known gene mutations in myeloid neoplasms. we describe the use of an oligo-snp array for genomic profiling of acna and cnloh, together with sequence analysis of recurrently mutated genes, in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) presenting with normal karyotype and fish results. oligo-snp array analysis revealed a hemizygous deletion of 896 kb at chromosome 5q31.2, representing the smallest 5q deletion reported to date. the deletion involved multiple genes, including two tumor suppressor candidate genes (ctnna1 and hspa9) that are associated with mds/aml. the snp-array study also detected 3 segments of somatic cnloh: one involved the entire long arm of chromosome 4; the second involved the distal half of the long arm of chromosome 7, and the third encompassed the entire chromosome 22 (upd 22). sequence analysis revealed mutations in tet2 (4q), ezh2 (7q), asxl1 (20q11.21), and runx1 (21q22.3). coincidently, tet2 and ezh2 were located at segments of cnloh resulting in their homozygosity. loss of heterozygosity affecting these two chromosomes and mutations in tet2 and ezh2 are indicative of a myelodysplastic syndrome with a poor prognosis. deletion of the tumor suppressor genes ctnna1 and hspa9 is also likely to contribute to a poor prognosis. furthermore, the original cnlohs in multiple chromosomes and additional cnloh 14q in the follow-up study suggest genetic evolution of the disease and poor prognosis. this study attests to the fact that some patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome who exhibit a normal karyotype may have underlying genetic abnormalities detectable by chromosomal microarray and/or targeted mutation analyses. loss of heterozygosity affecting chromosome 7q is common in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, pointing toward the essential role of this region in disease phenotype and clonal evolution. the higher resolution offered by recently developed genomic platforms may be used to establish more precise clinical correlations and identify specific target genes. we analyzed a series of patients with myeloid disorders using recent genomic technologies (1458 by single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays [snp-a], 226 by next-generation sequencing, and 183 by expression microarrays). using snp-a, we identified chromosome 7q loss of heterozygosity segments in 161 of 1458 patients (11%); 26% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients harbored 7q uniparental disomy, of which 41% had a homozygous ezh2 mutation. in addition, we describe an snp-a-isolated deletion 7 hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome subset, with a high rate of progression. using direct and parallel sequencing, we found no recurrent mutations in typically large deletion 7q and monosomy 7 patients. in contrast, we detected a markedly decreased expression of genes included in our snp-a defined minimally deleted regions. although a 2-hit model is present in most patients with 7q uniparental disomy and a myeloproliferative phenotype, haplodeficient expression of defined regions of 7q may underlie pathogenesis in patients with deletions and predominant dysplastic features.
abstract recently, r π σ ⁎ -extensions have been introduced which extend karr's π σ ⁎ -fields substantially: one can represent expressions not only in terms of transcendental sums and products, but one can work also with products over primitive roots of unity. since one can solve the parameterized telescoping problem in such rings, covering as special cases the summation paradigms of telescoping and creative telescoping, one obtains a rather flexible toolbox for symbolic summation. this article is the continuation of this work. inspired by singer's galois theory of difference equations we will work out several alternative characterizations of r π σ ⁎ -extensions: adjoining naively sums and products leads to an r π σ ⁎ -extension iff the obtained difference ring is simple iff the ring can be embedded into the ring of sequences iff the ring can be given by the interlacing of π σ ⁎ -extensions. from the viewpoint of applications this leads to a fully automatic machinery to represent indefinite nested sums and products in such r π σ ⁎ -rings. in addition, we work out how the parameterized telescoping paradigm can be used to prove algebraic independence of indefinite nested sums. furthermore, one obtains an alternative reduction tactic to solve the parameterized telescoping problem in basic r π σ ⁎ -extensions exploiting the interlacing property. we provide algorithms that find, in case of existence, indefinite nested sum extensions in which a (creative) telescoping solution can be expressed with minimal nested depth.
the nerve growth factor (ngf) receptor, trka, the tumour suppressor p53 and the phosphatase shp-1 are critical in cell proliferation and differentiation. shp-1 is a trka phosphatase that dephosphorylates trka at tyrosines (y) 674 and 675. p53 can induce trka activation and tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of ngf stimulation. in breast cancer tumours trka expression is associated with increased patient survival. trka protein expression is higher in breast-cancer cell lines than in normal breast epithelia. in cell lines (but not in normal breast epithelia) trka is functional and can be ngf-stimulated to promote cell proliferation. this study investigates the functional relationship between trka, p53 and shp-1 in breast-cancer, and reveals that in wild-type (wt) trka expressing breast-cancer cells both endogenous wtp53, activated by therapeutic agents, and transfected wtp53 repress expression of shp-1 through the proximal ccaat sequence of the shp-1-p1-promoter and the transcription factor nf-y. in these cells trka-y674/y675 phosphorylation is detected when shp-1 protein levels decrease in a wtp53-dependent manner. proliferation and cell-cycle assays, with cells expressing endogenous or transfected wt-trka and a temperature-sensitive p53 grown at 32 °c (when p53 is in the wt configuration), show suppressed cell proliferation. suppression is not detected when grown at 37 °c (when p53 is in the mutant configuration). a release from suppression is observed when these cells are transiently transfected with wt-shp-1 and grown at 32 °c. suppression is also detected when, as control, wt-trka-expressing cells are transiently transfected with shp-1-sirna, but not when a dominant-negative (dn) mutant trka is used to abolish wt-trka activity. importantly, suppression is not seen with control trka-negative breast-cancer cells (expressing wtp53, wt-shp-1 and undetectable trka), transfected with y674f/y675f mutant-trka. brdu-incorporation experiments reveal lack of incorporation in cells expressing wt-trka and wtp53, or wt-trka and shp-1-sirna. however, brdu is incorporated in the presence of y674f/y675f mutant trka or dn mutant trka. these results indicate that p53 repression of shp-1 expression leads to trka-y674/y675 phosphorylation and trka-dependent suppression of breast-cancer cell proliferation. these data provide an explanation as to why high trka levels are associated with favourable prognosis. growth factors of the egf family and their respective erbb/her receptor tyrosine kinases underlie many landmarks of tumor cells, including excessive growth, invasive behavior and attraction of blood vessels. enhanced expression of erbb proteins, existence of permanently active receptor mutants and occurrence of autocrine loops are frequently observed in human cancer, and in some cases they associate with poor disease outcome. the four erbb proteins and their 11 ligands act within a layered signaling network coordinated by erbb-2/her2, the most oncogenic family member. drugs that intercept signals emanating from erbb-2 and erbb-1 are already in routine clinical application. here we review three major strategies to develop new erbb-targeted therapies. these are monoclonal anti-receptor antibodies, specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antagonists of heat shock protein 90. the underlying mechanisms are critically examined, with an emphasis on potential drug combinations, which hold promise for enhanced clinical efficacy.
background: health care providers nationwide are routinely trained in advanced cardiac life support (acls), an american heart association program that teaches cardiac arrest management. recent changes in the acls approach have de-emphasized routine pulse checks in an effort to promote uninterrupted chest compressions. we hypothesized that this new acls algorithm may lead to uncertainty regarding the appropriate action following detection of a pulse during a cardiac arrest. methods: we conducted an observational study in which a web-based survey was sent to acls-trained medical providers at 4 major urban tertiary care centers in the united states. the survey consisted of 5 multiple-choice, scenario-based acls questions, including our question of interest. adult staff members with a valid acls certification were included. results: a total of 347 surveys were analyzed. the response rate was 28.1%. the majority (53.6%) of responders were between 18 and 32 years old, and 59.9% were female. the majority (54.2%) of responders incorrectly stated that they would continue cpr and possibly administer additional therapies when a team member detects a pulse immediately following defibrillation. secondarily, only 51.9% of respondents correctly chose to perform a rhythm check following 2 minutes of cpr. the other 3 survey questions were correctly answered an average of 89.1% of the time. conclusion: confusion exists regarding whether or not cpr and cardiac medications should be continued in the presence of a pulse. education may be warranted to emphasize avoiding compressions and medications when a palpable pulse is detected. a study was undertaken to determine the pattern of end-tidal carbon dioxide (etco2) changes during asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest in a pediatric canine model. eleven intubated, anesthetized, paralyzed dogs (mean age, 4.1 mo; mean weight, 5.5 kg) were used. asphyxia was induced by clamping the endotracheal tube (ett) and discontinuing ventilation. cardiac arrest ensued a few minutes later, after which closed-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) and ventilation were initiated. the etco2 level was recorded at baseline and every minute during cpr. mean baseline etco2 was 31.9 mm hg. the initial etco2 immediately after unclamping the ett (mean, 35 mm hg) was higher than subsequent values (mean, 12.4 mm hg; p < .001). there was a sudden increase in etco2 to a mean of 27.0 mm hg at or just before return of spontaneous circulation (rosc) in all 11 cases (p < .01). during cpr, etco2 levels were initially high, decreased to low levels, and increased again at rosc. this pattern, not previously described, is different from that observed in animal and adult cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation, during which etco2 decreases to almost zero after the onset of arrest, begins to increase after the onset of effective cpr, and increases to normal levels at rosc. in this model of asphyxial arrest, continued cardiac output prior to arrest allows continued delivery of co2 to the lungs, resulting in higher alveolar co2; this, in turn, is reflected as increased etco2 once ventilation is resumed during cpr. further study is needed to determine whether the pattern of etco2 changes can be used prospectively to define the etiology of cardiac arrest.
the enslavement of an alpha-proteobacterial endosymbiont by the last common eukaryotic ancestor resulted in large-scale gene transfer of endosymbiont genes to the host nucleus as the endosymbiont transitioned into the mitochondrion. mitochondrial genomes have experienced widespread gene loss and genome reduction within eukaryotes and dna sequencing has revealed that most of these gene losses occurred early in eukaryotic lineage diversification. on a broad scale, more recent modifications to organelle genomes appear to be conserved and phylogenetically informative. the first red algal mitochondrial genome was sequenced more than 20 years ago, and an additional 29 florideophyceae mitochondria have been added over the past decade. a total of 32 genes have been described to have been missing or considered non-functional pseudogenes from these florideophyceae mitochondria. these losses have been attributed to endosymbiotic gene transfer or the evolution of a parasitic life strategy. here we sequenced the mitochondrial genomes from the red algal parasite choreocolax polysiphoniae and its host vertebrata lanosa and found them to be complete and conserved in structure with other florideophyceae mitochondria. this result led us to resequence the previously published parasite gracilariophila oryzoides and its host gracilariopsis andersonii, as well as reevaluate reported gene losses from published florideophyceae mitochondria. multiple independent losses of rpl20 and a single loss of rps11 can be verified. however by reannotating published data and resequencing specimens when possible, we were able to identify the majority of genes that have been reported as lost or pseudogenes from florideophyceae mitochondria. over the past several decades, our knowledge of the origin and evolution of mitochondria has been greatly advanced by determination of complete mitochondrial genome sequences. among the most informative mitochondrial genomes have been those of protists (primarily unicellular eukaryotes), some of which harbor the most gene-rich and most eubacteria-like mitochondrial dnas (mtdnas) known. comparison of mtdna sequence data has provided insights into the radically diverse trends in mitochondrial genome evolution exhibited by different phylogenetically coherent groupings of eukaryotes, and has allowed us to pinpoint specific protist relatives of the multicellular eukaryotic lineages (animals, plants, and fungi). this comparative genomics approach has also revealed unique and fascinating aspects of mitochondrial gene expression, highlighting the mitochondrion as an evolutionary playground par excellence.
ptf1a, along with an e protein and rbpj, forms the transcription factor complex ptf1-j that is essential for proper specification of inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord, retina, and cerebellum. here we show that two highly conserved noncoding genomic regions, a distal 2.3 kb sequence located 13.4 kb 5′ and a 12.4 kb sequence located immediately 3′ of the ptf1a coding region, have distinct activity in controlling ptf1a expression in all of these domains. the 5′ 2.3 kb sequence functions as an autoregulatory element and directs reporter gene expression to all ptf1a domains in the developing nervous system. the autoregulatory activity of this element was demonstrated by binding of the ptf1-j complex in vitro, ptf1a localization to this genomic region in vivo, and the in vivo requirement of ptf1a for the activity of the regulatory element in transgenic mice. in contrast, the 12.4 kb 3′ regulatory region does not contain any conserved ptf1 sites, and its expression in transgenic mice is independent of ptf1a. thus, regulatory information for initiation of ptf1a expression in the developing nervous system is located within the 12.4 kb sequence 3′ of the ptf1a gene. together, these results identify multiple transcriptional mechanisms that control ptf1a levels, one modulating levels by autoregulation through the ptf1-j complex, and the other a ptf1a-independent mechanism for initial activation. ptf1a is an unusual basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) transcription factor that is required for the development of the pancreas. we show that early in pancreatic development, active ptf1a requires interaction with rbpj, the vertebrate suppressor of hairless, within a stable trimeric dna-binding complex (ptf1). later, as acinar cell development begins, rbpj is swapped for rbpjl, the constitutively active, pancreas-restricted paralog of rbpj. moreover, the rbpjl gene is a direct target of the ptf1 complex: at the onset of acinar cell development when the rbpjl gene is first induced, a ptf1 complex containing rbpj is bound to the rbpjl promoter. as development proceeds, rbpjl gradually replaces rbpj in the ptf1 complex bound to rbpjl and appears on the binding sites for the complex in the promoters of other acinar-specific genes, including those for the secretory digestive enzymes. a single amino acid change in ptf1a that eliminates its ability to bind rbpj (but does not affect its binding to rbpjl) causes pancreatic development to truncate at an immature stage, without the formation of acini or islets. these results indicate that the interaction between ptf1a and rbpj is required for the early stage of pancreatic growth, morphogenesis, and lineage fate decisions. the defects in pancreatic development phenocopy those of ptf1a-null embryos; thus, the first critical function of ptf1a is in the context of the ptf1 complex containing rbpj. action within an organ-specific transcription factor is a previously unknown function for rbpj and is independent of its role in notch signaling.
backgrounddifferences in gene expression may be caused by nearby dna polymorphisms (cis regulation) or by interactions of gene control regions with polymorphic transcription factors (trans regulation). trans acting loci are much harder to detect than cis acting loci and their effects are much more sensitive to genetic background.resultsto quantify cis and trans regulation we correlated haplotype data with gene expression in two inbred mouse strains and two derived congenic lines. upstream haplotype differences between the parental strains suggested that 30-43% of differentially expressed genes were differentially expressed because of cis haplotype differences. these cis regulated genes displayed consistent and relatively tissue-independent differential expression. we independently estimated from the congenic mice that 71-85% of genes were trans regulated. cis regulated genes were associated with low p values (p < 0.005) for differential expression, whereas trans regulated genes were associated with values 0.005 < p < 0.05. the genes differentially expressed between congenics and controls were not a subset of those that were differentially expressed between the founder lines, showing that these were dependent on genetic background. for example, the cholesterol synthesis pathway was strongly differentially expressed in the congenic mice by indirect trans regulation but this was not observable in the parental mice.conclusionsthe evidence that most gene regulation is trans and strongly influenced by genetic background, suggests that pathways that are modified by an allelic variant, may only exhibit differential expression in the specific genetic backgrounds in which they were identified. this has significant implications for the interpretation of any qtl mapping study. genetical genomics has been proposed to map loci controlling gene-expression differences (eqtls) that might underlie functional trait variation. we briefly review the studies in model species and conclude that, although they successfully demonstrate the utility of genetical genomics, they are too limited to unlock the full potential of this approach and some results should be interpreted with caution. we subsequently elaborate on two recent studies that use this approach in humans. the many differences between these studies complicate meaningful comparisons between them. a joint analysis of the two experiments offers some scope for more powerful genetical genomics.
background a multiple pregnancy is now considered to be the most common adverse outcome associated with in vitro fertilization (ivf). as a consequence, the identification of women with the best chances of embryo implantation is a challenge in ivf program, in which the objective is to offer elective single-embryo transfer (eset) without decreasing the pregnancy rate. to date, a range of hormonal and clinical parameters have been used to optimize eset but none have significant predictive value. this variability could be due to genetic predispositions related to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps). here, we assessed the individual and combined impacts of thirteen snps that reportedly influence the outcome of in vitro fertilisation (ivf) on the embryo implantation rate for patients undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection program (icsi). materials and methods a 13 gene polymorphisms: fshr(asn680ser), p53(arg72pro), amh(ile49ser), esr2(+1730g>a), esr1(−397t>c), bmp15(−9c>g), mthfr1(677c>t), mthfr2(1298a>c), hla-g(−725c>g), vegf(+405g>c), tnfα(−308a>g), amhr(−482a>g), pai-1(4g/5g), multiplex pcr assay was designed to genotype women undergoing icsi program. we analyzed the total patients population (n = 428) and a subgroup with homogeneous characteristics (n = 112). results only the vegf(+405g>c) and tnfα(−308a>g) polymorphisms impacted fertilization, embryo implantation and pregnancy rates. moreover, the combined vegf+405.gg and tnfα-308.ag or aa genotype occurred significantly more frequently in women with high implantation potential. in contrast, the vegf+405.cc and tnfα-308.gg combination was associated with a low implantation rate. conclusion we identified associations between vegf(+405g>c) and tnfα(−308a>g) polymorphisms (when considered singly or as combinations) and the embryo implantation rate. these associations may be predictive of embryo implantation and could help to define populations in which elective single-embryo transfer should be recommended (or, conversely, ruled out). however, the mechanism underlying the function of these polymorphisms in embryo implantation remains to be determined and the associations observed here must be confirmed in a larger, more heterogeneous cohort. polymorphic variants on chromosomes are considered 'normal', as heterochromatin has no coding potential and nucleolar organizing regions (nor) contain genes coding for rrna. variants have been reported in infertility and recurrent abortions. with refined molecular techniques, genes for fertility and viability are now thought to reside in heterochromatin. dna sequence analysis of human chromosome 9 has shown that it is highly structurally polymorphic, with many intrachromosomal and interchromosomal duplications, and contains the largest autosomal block of heterochromatin. transcriptional activation of constitutive heterochromatic domains of the human genome in response to environmental stress was reported recently. heat shock triggers the assembly of nuclear stress bodies on the pericentromeric heterochromatin of human chromosomes including chromosome 9. these are characterized by an epigenetic status typical of euchromatic regions. on acrocentric chromosomes, nor-associated protein count and morphology was reported to separate benign and malignant melanocytic lesions. hence all variants may not be 'normal'. the present study of karyotyping 842 individuals attending an ivf clinic with primary infertility or repeated miscarriages, showed polymorphic variants in 28.82% of males and 17.19% of females, which was quite high. it is suggested that variants should not be ignored by cytogeneticists. screening prospective gamete donors for chromosome variants may help enhance the success of ivf.
the aim of this study is to review the reliability of laparoscopic obesity operations in patients with situs inversus totalis(sit). a new case of sit was presented together with a literature review of published english language studies on laparoscopic gastric banding (lagb), laparoscopic gastric bypass (lrygb), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (lsg), laparoscopic obesity surgery (los), and sit, accessed via pubmed and google scholar databases. the case is presented of a 21-year-old female patient who underwent lsg due to sit. a total of 12 publications in literature matched the search criteria for lagb, lrygb, lsg, los, and sit, which reported lagb in five cases, lrygb in four cases, and lsg in four cases. in the rare event of sit, los can be safely used following good evaluation. laparoscopic surgery with situs inversus may pose particular challenges to the surgeon. we discuss a case of undiagnosed situs inversus totalis in a morbidly obese patient undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (lagb). the patient was a 29-year-old male with a body mass index (bmi) of 56. there was no prior knowledge of his situs inversus totalis, which was only discovered during laparoscopy at the time of surgery. the operative challenges are discussed. lagb was performed successfully without complication. postoperative imaging confirmed dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis, as well as correct gastric band position. however, there has been subsequent gastric band erosion and eventual band removal. we discuss the appropriateness of lagb in this group of patients.
backgroundantigen desensitization through oral tolerance is becoming an increasingly attractive treatment option for allergic diseases. however, the mechanism(s) by which tolerization is achieved remain poorly defined. in this study we endeavored to induce oral tolerance to cockroach allergen (cra: a complex mixture of insect components) in order to ameliorate asthma-like, allergic pulmonary inflammation.methodswe compared the pulmonary inflammation of mice which had received four cra feedings prior to intratracheal allergen sensitization and challenge to mice fed pbs on the same time course. respiratory parameters were assessed by whole body unrestrained plethysmography and mechanical ventilation with forced oscillation. bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (bal) and lung homogenate (lh) were assessed for cytokines and chemokines by elisa. bal inflammatory cells were also collected and examined by light microscopy.resultscra feeding prior to allergen sensitization and challenge led to a significant improvement in respiratory health. airways hyperreactivity measured indirectly via enhanced pause (penh) was meaningfully reduced in the cra-fed mice compared to the pbs fed mice (2.3 ± 0.4 vs 3.9 ± 0.6; p = 0.03). directly measured airways resistance confirmed this trend when comparing the cra-fed to the pbs-fed animals (2.97 ± 0.98 vs 4.95 ± 1.41). this effect was not due to reduced traditional inflammatory cell chemotactic factors, th2 or other cytokines and chemokines. the mechanism of improved respiratory health in the tolerized mice was due to significantly reduced eosinophil numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (43300 ± 11445 vs 158786 ± 38908; p = 0.007) and eosinophil specific peroxidase activity in the lung homogenate (0.59 ± 0.13 vs 1.19 ± 0.19; p = 0.017). the decreased eosinophilia was likely the result of increased il-10 in the lung homogenate of the tolerized mice (6320 ± 354 ng/ml vs 5190 ± 404 ng/ml, p = 0.02).conclusionour results show that oral tolerization to cra can improve the respiratory health of experimental mice in a cra-induced model of asthma-like pulmonary inflammation by reducing pulmonary eosinophilia. several cytokines derived from th3 and tr1 cells, including il-10, are believed to regulate oral tolerance, but direct evidence is lacking. we have explored the potential role of il-10 by generating transgenic (tg) mice with sustained hepatocyte-specific expression of rat il-10. tg mice expressed rat il-10 downstream of a transthyretin promoter, which led to serum levels that were increased 10- to 100-fold compared with normal animals. animals were orally administered 1 mg of whole ova for 5 consecutive days, with control animals receiving pbs. there were six animal groups: either ova or pbs were fed orally to rat il-10 tg mice, non-tg wild-type mice without il-10 administration, and non-tg wild-type mice administered rat il-10 systemically. on day 8, all mice were immunized with two injections of ova, and then analyzed on day 18. t cell proliferation responses were reduced by 65.8 ± 14.3% after feeding of ova in ril-10 tg animals, compared with 39.4 ± 15.6% in the non-tg mice (p = 0.02). anti-ova titers were expressed as fold increase over naive non-tg mice. after feeding, titers decreased by ∼33% (from 3- to 2-fold) in tg animals and, to a lesser extent, in non-tg animals. ifn-γ secretion by cultured popliteal lymphocytes decreased in tg animals by 83% after feeding and by 69% in non-tg animals. il-4 secretion increased 4-fold in tg-fed mice, but did not significantly change in non-tg ova-fed animals. in contrast to hepatic tg expression of ril-10, systemic administration of ril-10 had only a modest effect on tolerance. il-10, when transgenically expressed in the liver enhances mucosal tolerance to an oral ag.
gelastic seizures are often associated with hypothalamic hamartomas. however, focal cortical dysplasias can also cause “laughing seizures”, and such cases can be difficult to localize with eeg. this case report presents a 29-year-old woman who was successfully rendered free of gelastic seizures after resection of a frontal cortical dysplasia, localized through mri and spect imaging. [published with video sequences] an unusual microscopic abnormality has been identified in the lobectomy specimens removed surgically from the brains of 10 epileptic patients. the abnormality could seldom be identified by palpation or with the naked eye. histologically, it consisted of congregations of large, bizarre neurones which were littered through all but the first cortical layer. in most, but not in all cases, grotesque cells, probably of glial origin, were also present in the depths of the affected cortex and in the subjacent white matter. this kind of abnormality appears to be a malformation. the picture is reminiscent of tuberous sclerosis but too many distinguishing features, both in the clinical and in the pathological aspects, make this diagnosis untenable. the cases are therefore looked on provisionally (since all but one are still alive) as comprising a distinct form of cortical dysplasia in which localized, exotic populations of nerve cells underlie the electrical and clinical manifestations of certain focal forms of epilepsy.
the shoot apical meristem (sam) of angiosperms comprises a group of undifferentiated cells which divide to maintain the meristem and also give rise to all the above-ground structures of the plant. previous studies revealed that the arabidopsis argonaute10 [ago10, also called pinhead (pnh) or zwille (zll)] gene is one of the critical sam regulators, but the mechanism by which ago10 modulates the sam is unknown. in the present study we show that ago10 genetically represses microrna165/166 (mir165/166) for sam maintenance as well as establishment of leaf adaxial-abaxial polarity. levels of mir165/166 in leaves and embryonic sams of pnh/zll/ago10 mutants are abnormally elevated, leading to a reduction in the quantity of homeodomain-leucine zipper (hd-zip) iii gene transcripts, the targets of mir165/166. this reduction is the primary cause of pnh/zll sam and leaf defects, because the aberrant pnh/zll phenotypes were partially rescued by either increasing levels of hd-zip iii transcripts or decreasing levels of mir165/166 in the sam and leaf. furthermore, plants with an abnormal apex were more frequent among pnh/zll rdr6 and pnh/zll ago7 double mutants and increased levels of mir165/166 were detected in rdr6 apices. these results indicate that ago10 and rdr6/ago7 may act in parallel in modulating accumulation of mir165/166 for normal plant development. in higher plants, class i knotted1-like homeobox (knox) gene suppression and leaf polarity establishment are two processes crucial for leaf morphogenesis. the arabidopsis genes, asymmetric leaves1 and 2 (as1 and as2), are required for repressing the class i knox genes and promoting leaf adaxial cell fates. in addition, the rna-dependent rna polymerase6 (rdr6) gene acts synergistically with as1 and as2 to specify the adaxial polarity and repress the knox genes in leaves. it is known that rdr6 is one of the key components in plant post-transcriptional gene silencing (ptgs), and is likely to function with other silencing components in a genetic pathway in regulating leaf patterning. here we report phenotypic analyses of double mutants combining as1 or as2 with other mutations relating to different rna silencing pathways. we show that plants carrying rdr6, suppressor of gene silencing3 (sgs3) or zippy (zip, also called ago7) in combination with as1 or as2 demonstrate severe morphological defects, and the double mutant plants are generally similar to one another. detailed phenotypic and molecular analyses reveal that leaves of rdr6 as2(1), sgs3 as2(1) and zip as2(1) all show an abnormal adaxial identity, and contain high levels of microrna165/166 and filamentous flower (fil) transcripts. these results suggest that rdr6, sgs3 and ago7 act in the same pathway, which genetically interacts with the as1-as2 pathway for leaf development. the rdr6-sgs3-ago7 pathway was previously identified as regulating the plant vegetative phase change. our results reveal a new function of the pathway, which is also required for normal leaf morphogenesis.
background this study was aimed at evaluating the correlation between hepatocyte paraffin 1 (hep par 1) and colorectal cancer. methods to this end, 50 intestinal biopsies were analyzed including 10 colorectal polyps with low grade dysplasia, 10 with high grade dysplasia, 10 colorectal adenocarcinomas, 10 specimens of normal ileum and 10 of normal colon mucosa. tissue sections were immunostained for hep par 1 utilizing a commercial antibody. normal colonic mucosa did not express hep par 1. results immunoreactivity for hep par 1 was detected in 20% of polyps with low grade dysplasia, 50% of polyps with high grade dysplasia and 60% of colorectal carcinomas. hep par 1 was frequently detected in the deepest areas of adenocarcinomas mainly in infiltrating tumour cells. conclusions our data show that hep par 1 immunoreactivity in human colon carcinogenesis is correlated with progression from low grade to high grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. in clinical practice, our data show that caution should be taken in utilizing hep par 1 as the sole tool in differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma from a liver metastasis of colon adenocarcinoma. our data encourage further investigations into the potential role played by hep par 1 in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. to examine the usefulness of hep par 1 together with selected antibodies in the separation of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) from cholangiocarcinoma (cc), combined tumours (hcc‐cc) and metastatic carcinoma.
spermiogenesis in the water fern marsilea vestita is a rapid process that requires the de novo formation of basal bodies in a cytoplasmic particle known as a blepharoplast. spermiogenesis is activated by placing dry spores into water and is dependent upon the translation of new proteins from stored mrnas with little, if any, new transcription. we looked at the necessity of cell division cycles in the gametophyte as a prerequisite for the activation of centrin translation and for the consequent formation of blepharoplasts. cell cycle arrest was induced by treatments of gametophytes with hydroxyurea, with olomoucine, or after rnai, employing dsrna derived from marsilea cyclin a or cyclin b. in all cases, centrin is translated from stored mrna at the normal time, approximately 4 hours after imbibition, and it accumulates to maximal levels approximately 6 hours after imbibition. in spite of the fact that centrin is translated at essentially normal times and accumulates to nearly normal levels, no blepharoplasts form in the gametophytes where division cycles have been disrupted. these results provide a clear demonstration that the new translation of centrin, by itself, is insufficient for blepharoplast formation, the de novo formation of basal bodies, and the assembly of a motile apparatus. and 10 na 3 hp 2 o 7. fv solution also contained 0.2 naf and 0.1 na 3 vo 4. rarely, irreversible current rundown still occurred with fvpp. the total na + concentration of all cytoplasmic solutions was adjusted to 30 mm with naoh, and ph was adjusted to 7.0 with n-methylglucamine (nmg) or hcl. pip 2 liposomes (20–200 nm) were prepared by sonicating 1 mm pip 2 (boehringer mannheim) in distilled water. reconstituted monoclonal pip 2 antibody (perspective biosystems, framingham, ma) was diluted 40-fold into experimental solution. current–voltage relations of all currents reversed at e k and showed characteristic rectification, mostly owing to the presence of na + in fvpp and possibly also residual polyamines. current records presented (measured at 30 њc, −30 mv holding potential) are digitized strip-chart recordings. purified bovine brain gbg 29 was diluted just before application such that the final detergent (chaps) concentration was 5 ␮m. detergent-containing solution was washed away thoroughly before application of pip 2 , because application of phos-pholipid vesicles in the presence of detergent usually reversed the effects of gbg; presumably, gbg can be extracted from membranes by detergent plus phospholipids. molecular biology. r188q mutation was constructed by insertion of the mutant oligonucleotides between the bsm1 and bglii sites of psport– romk1 (ref. 11). a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fragment (amino acids 180–391) from psport–romk1 r188q mutant was subcloned into pgex-2t vector (pharmacia) for expression of r188q mutant protein of gst–rkc.
the sex ratio in the first trimester of pregnancy shifts toward males due to increased elimination of female embryos. one reason for this phenomenon may be disruption of x chromosome inactivation. in this paper, we have analyzed the nature of the x chromosome inactivation in extraembryonic tissues of induced and spontaneous abortuses with 46,xx karyotype. both equiprobable and asymmetric inactivation have been found in chorionic cytotrophoblast from spontaneous and induced abortuses. in the extraembryonic mesoderm of the control group of embryos, only equiprobable inactivation has been found, whereas this parameter was shifted in 15% of spontaneous abortions. the highest incidence of the selective inactivation of one of the parent homologues was found in the group with a lack of development of embryos and embryos from women with recurrent miscarriages. one of the reasons for the observed results can be compartmentalization of cells in the blastocyst leading to the nonrandom redistribution of cells and the predominance in the inner mass of cells with an active x chromosome with aberrations incompatible with normal embryonic development. imprinted inactivation of the paternal x chromosome in marsupials is the primordial mechanism of dosage compensation for x-linked genes between females and males in therians. in eutherian mammals, x chromosome inactivation (xci) evolved into a random process in cells from the embryo proper, where either the maternal or paternal x can be inactivated. however, species like mouse and bovine maintained imprinted xci exclusively in extraembryonic tissues. the existence of imprinted xci in humans remains controversial, with studies based on the analyses of only one or two x-linked genes in different extraembryonic tissues. here we readdress this issue in human term placenta by performing a robust analysis of allele-specific expression of 22 x-linked genes, including xist, using 27 snps in transcribed regions. we show that xci is random in human placenta, and that this organ is arranged in relatively large patches of cells with either maternal or paternal inactive x. in addition, this analysis indicated heterogeneous maintenance of gene silencing along the inactive x, which combined with the extensive mosaicism found in placenta, can explain the lack of agreement among previous studies. our results illustrate the differences of xci mechanism between humans and mice, and highlight the importance of addressing the issue of imprinted xci in other species in order to understand the evolution of dosage compensation in placental mammals.
background toll-like receptors (tlrs) play a crucial role in the activation of innate immunity in response to many viruses. we previously reported the implication of tlr2 in the recognition of epstein-barr virus (ebv) by human monocytes. because murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (mhv-68) is a useful model to study human gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis in vivo, we evaluated the importance of mouse tlr2 in the recognition of mhv-68. methodology/principal findings in studies using transfected hek293 cells, mhv-68 lead to the activation of nf-κb reporter through tlr2. in addition, production of interleukin-6 (il-6) and interferon-α (ifn-α) upon mhv-68 stimulation was reduced in murine embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) derived from tlr2−/− and myd88−/− mice as compared to their wild type (wt) counterpart. in transgenic mice expressing a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the mtlr2 promoter, mhv-68 challenge activated tlr2 transcription. increased expression levels of tlr2 on blood granulocytes (cd115−gr1+) and inflammatory monocytes (cd115+gr1+), which mobilized to the lungs upon infection with mhv-68, was also confirmed by flow cytometry. finally, tlr2 or myd88 deficiency was associated with decreased il-6 and type 1 ifn production as well as increased viral burden during short-term challenges with mhv-68. conclusions/significance tlr2 contributes to the production of inflammatory cytokines and type 1 ifn as well as to the control of viral burden during infection with mhv-68. taken together, our results suggest that the tlr2 pathway has a relevant role in the recognition of this virus and in the subsequent activation of the innate immune response. neutrophils are involved in the initial host response to influenza a virus (iav) infection and exhibit both activation and depressed function after exposure to the virus. we demonstrate that iav causes rapid upregulation of toll‐like receptor 2 (tlr2) expression on neutrophils. the neutrophil agonists, formyl‐methylpleucyl‐alanine (fmlp), c5a and lipopolysaccharide did not alter neutrophil tlr2 expression, whereas pma and the microbial tlr2 ligands, peptidoglycan (pgn) and zymosan, reduced it. to determine the functional significance of iav‐induced increase in tlr2 expression, iav‐treated neutrophils were exposed to pgn, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and zymosan. pretreatment with iav resulted in significantly increased uptake of s. aureus and zymosan and accelerated neutrophil apoptosis when combined with s. aureus. iav‐treated cells generated significantly more h2o2 in response to pgn. these results indicate that iav increases neutrophil surface expression of tlr2 and modulates functional responses to ligands that bind tlr2. these findings may clarify iav‐induced perturbation of neutrophil functions in vivo.
stereo vision relies on cortical signals that encode binocular disparity. in v1, the disparity energy model explains many features of binocular interaction, but it overestimates the responses to anticorrelated images. combining the outputs of two, or more, energy model-like subunits [two-subunit (2su) model] can resolve this discrepancy and provides an alternative explanation for disparity signals previously thought to indicate phase disparity between the receptive fields (rfs) of each eye. the 2su model naturally explains how “near/far” (odd-symmetric) tuning becomes dominant in extrastriate cortex. to compare the energy and the 2su models, we used a broadband compound grating and applied a common interocular phase difference to all spatial frequency components (a stimulus phase disparity), combined with a common spatial displacement (a stimulus position disparity). this produces binocular images that never occur in natural viewing, for which the 2su model and the energy model make distinctively different predictions. responses of neurons recorded from both v1 and v2 of awake rhesus macaques systematically deviated from the predictions of the energy model, in accordance with the 2su model. these deviations correlated with the symmetry of the tuning curve, indicating that the 2su mechanism is exploited to produce odd symmetry. nonetheless, individual subunits also contain rf phase disparity that contributes to odd symmetry. the results suggest that neurons in v2 probably inherit phase disparity signals from v1 neurons, but systematically combine input from v1 neurons with different position disparities, in a way that elaborates odd-symmetric tuning and extends the range of disparities encoded by single neurons. one of the fundamental challenges of binocular vision is that objects project to different positions on the two retinas (binocular disparity). neurons in visual cortex show two distinct types of tuning to disparity, position and phase disparity, which are the results of differences in receptive field location and profile, respectively. here, we point out that phase disparity does not occur in natural images. why, then, should the brain encode it? we propose that phase-disparity detectors help to work out which feature in the left eye corresponds to a given feature in the right. this correspondence problem is plagued by false matches: regions of the image that look similar, but do not correspond to the same object. we show that phase-disparity neurons tend to be more strongly activated by false matches. thus, they may act as 'lie detectors', enabling the true correspondence to be deduced by a process of elimination.
objective. analyze the learning curve for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in a low volume program. materials and methods. a single surgeon operated on 165 patients. patients were consecutively divided in 3 groups of 55 patients (groups a, b, and c). an enhancement of estimated blood loss, surgery length, and presence of a positive surgical margin were all considered as a function of surgeon's experience. results. operative time was 267 minutes for group a, 230 minutes for group b, and 159 minutes for group c, and the operative time decreased over time, but a significant difference was present only between groups a and c (p < 0.001). mean estimated blood loss was 328 ml, 254 ml, and 206 ml (p = 0.24). a conversion to open surgery was necessary in 4 patients in group a. positive surgical margin rates were 29.1%, 21.8%, and 5.5% (p = 0.02). eight patients in group a, 4 patients in group b, and one in group c had biochemical recurrence. conclusion. significantly less intraoperative complications were evident after the first 51 cases. all other parameters (blood loss, operative time, and positive surgical margins) significantly decreased and stabilized after 110 cases. those outcomes were somehow similar to previous published series by high-volume centers. background we previously reported the learning curve for open radical prostatectomy, reporting large decreases in recurrence rates with increasing surgeon experience. here we aim to characterise the learning curve for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.   methods we did a retrospective cohort study of 4702 patients with prostate cancer treated laparoscopically by one of 29 surgeons from seven institutions in europe and north america between january, 1998, and june, 2007. multivariable models were used to assess the association between surgeon experience at the time of each patient's operation and prostate-cancer recurrence, with adjustment for established predictors.   findings after adjusting for case mix, greater surgeon experience was associated with a lower risk of recurrence (p=0.0053). the 5-year risk of recurrence decreased from 17% to 16% to 9% for a patient treated by a surgeon with 10, 250, and 750 prior laparoscopic procedures, respectively (risk difference between 10 and 750 procedures 8.0%, 95% ci 4.4-12.0). the learning curve for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was slower than the previously reported learning curve for open surgery (p<0.001). surgeons with previous experience of open radical prostatectomy had significantly poorer results than those whose first operation was laparoscopic (risk difference 12.3%, 95% ci 8.8-15.7).   interpretation increasing surgical experience is associated with substantial reductions in cancer recurrence after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, but improvements in outcome seem to accrue more slowly than for open surgery. laparoscopic radical prostatectomy seems to involve skills that do not translate well from open radical prostatectomy.   funding national cancer institute, the allbritton fund, and the david j koch foundation.
the treatment of fractures of the distal third of the tibia has evolved with the development of improved imaging and surgical techniques. the outcome of treatment using conventional fixation is poor. we report a study on indirect reduction in 26 patients. all cases achieved radiological union and full weight bearing. the good to excellent results suggest that this method should be considered in metaphyseal fractures where intra-medullary nails are not suitable.résuméle traitement des fractures de la partie distale du tibia avec troisième fragment peut être amélioré avec le développement des techniques d’imagerie et de traitements chirurgicaux. le devenir du traitement, utilisant une fixation conventionnelle est peu satisfaisante. nous rapportons une étude sur la réduction indirecte de cette fracture chez 26 patients. tous les cas sont consolidés sur le plan radiographique, avec appui total. les excellents résultats suggèrent que cette méthode peut être utilisée dans les fractures métaphysaires dans lesquelles l’enclouage centro médullaire n’est pas possible. objective to describe the extraosseous blood supply of the tibia and how the blood supply of the distal tibia is influenced by different plating techniques. design microdissection of cadaveric adult hip disarticulation specimens following sequential arterial injections of india ink and ward's blue latex was performed. readily identifiable arterioles measured approximately 0.5 mm in diameter. their artery of origin was identified, and their position along the medial, lateral, and posterior aspects of the tibia was documented relative to the tibial plafond. additionally, six matched pairs of limbs were used to assess the effects of different plating techniques on the extraosseous blood supply along the medial aspect of the distal tibia. setting university anatomy laboratory. patients/participants nine matched pairs (n = 18) of randomly obtained, adult cadaveric hip disarticulation specimens. intervention india ink followed by ward's blue latex was injected into the superficial femoral artery at the level of the inguinal crease after cleansing of the arterial system. the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscles were dissected from the leg, exposing the arterial system and the extraosseous vessels of the tibia. mean outcome measurements the extraosseous blood supply of each aspect of the tibial diaphysis was determined. each extraosseous arteriole was identified, and the locations of each documented relative to the tibial plafond. changes in the filling of these vessels along the medial aspect of the distal tibia were documented in a separate group of specimens (n = 12), which had undergone two different plating techniques. results the proximal metaphysis of the tibia was found to have a rich extraosseous blood supply provided primarily from vessels from the popliteal artery, the anterior tibial artery (ata) laterally, and the posterior tibial artery (pta) medially. in comparison, the tibial diaphysis was found to have relatively few extraosseous vessels and a considerably hypovascular region, posteriorly. branches of the ata were found to supply the posterior aspect of the diaphysis with these branches passing through the interosseous membrane. the diaphysis also received a variable contribution from the pta. the lateral aspect of the diaphysis was supplied by branches of the ata. an anastomotic network of arteries from the ata and pta formed the rich extraosseous blood supply of the medial distal aspect of the tibia. open plating of the medial aspect of the distal tibia caused a statistically significant (p < 0.05) greater disruption of the extraosseous blood supply of the metaphyseal region than did percutaneously applied plates. in each specimen, open plating prevented filling of each periosteal vessel in the region as opposed to percutaneous plates, which permitted filling of the extraosseous vessels up to the edge of the plate. conclusions the proximal and distal metaphyseal areas of the tibia have a rich extraosseous blood supply provided primarily by branches of the ata and the pta. open plating of the medial aspect of the distal tibia caused a greater disruption of this extraosseous blood supply than did percutaneously applied plates. disruption of these extraosseous vessels following fracture and subsequent operative stabilization may slow healing and increase the risk of delayed union and nonunion. these findings support current efforts to develop less invasive methods and implants for operative stabilization of distal tibia fractures.
recent research has indicated that the antimicrobial chemical triclocarban (tcc) represents a new type of endocrine disruptor, amplifying the transcriptional activity of steroid hormones and their receptors while itself exhibiting little affinity for these receptors. the effects of tcc were studied in the freshwater mudsnail potamopyrgus antipodarum. specimens were exposed to concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 10.5 microg/l dissolved tcc and were removed and dissected, and embryos contained within the brood pouch were counted and classified as shelled or unshelled after two and four weeks of exposure. after four weeks, environmentally relevant tcc concentrations of 1.6 to 10.5 microg/l resulted in statistically significant increases in the number of unshelled embryos, whereas 0.2, 1.6, and 10.5 microg/l exposures significantly increased numbers of shelled embryos. the lowest observed effect concentration (loec) was 0.2 microg/l, the no observed effect concentration (noec) was 0.05 microg/l; the 10% effective concentration (ec10) and the median effective concentration (ec50) for unshelled effects were 0.5 microg/l and 2.5 microg/l, respectively. given the widespread occurrence of tcc in the environment and the effects shown at environmentally relevant concentrations, these results indicate that tcc may be causing reproductive effects in the environment. furthermore, the present study indicates that environmental risk from a new class of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (edcs) is both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to risk from existing classes of edcs. the antimicrobial compound triclocarban (tcc; 3,4,4'-trichlorocarbanilide; cas# 101-20-2) is a high-production-volume chemical, recently suggested to cause widespread contamination of us water resources. to test this hypothesis, we developed an isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method for ultratrace analysis of tcc (0.9 ng/l detection limit) and analyzed low-volume water samples (200 ml) along with primary sludge samples from across the united states. all river water samples (100%) collected downstream of wastewater treatment plants had detectable levels of tcc, as compared to 56% of those taken upstream. concentrations of tcc (mean+/-standard deviation) downstream of sewage treatment plants (84+/-110 ng/l) were significantly higher (p<0.05; wilcoxon rank sum test) than those of samples taken upstream (12+/-15 ng/l). compared to surface water, mean tcc concentrations found in dried, primary sludge obtained from municipal sewage treatment plants in five states were six orders of magnitude greater (19,300+/-7100 microg/kg). several river samples contained a co-contaminant, identified based on its chromatographic retention time, molecular base ion, and ms/ms fragmentation behavior as 4,4'-dichlorocarbanilide (dcc; cas# 1219-99-4). in addition to tcc and dcc, municipal sludge contained a second co-contaminant, 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorocarbanilide (tetracc; cas# 4300-43-0). both newly detected compounds were present as impurities (0.2%(w/w) each) in technical grade tcc (99%). application of the new method for chlorocarbanilide analysis yielded tcc occurrence data for 13 us states, confirmed the role of sewage treatment plants as environmental inputs of tcc, and identified dcc and tetracc as previously unrecognized pollutants released into the environment alongside tcc.
controversy exists as to whether platelet-activating factor (paf), a potent phospholipid mediator of inflammation, can actually protect the heart from postischemic injury. to determine whether endogenous activation of the paf receptor is cardioprotective, we examined postischemic functional recovery in isolated hearts from wild-type and paf receptor-knockout mice. postischemic function was reduced in hearts with targeted deletion of the paf receptor and in wild-type hearts treated with a paf receptor antagonist. furthermore, perfusion with picomolar concentrations of paf improved postischemic function in hearts from wild-type mice. to elucidate the mechanism of a paf-mediated cardioprotective effect, we employed a model of intracellular ca2+ overload and loss of function in nonischemic ventricular myocytes. we found that paf receptor activation attenuates the time-dependent loss of shortening and increases in intracellular ca2+ transients in ca2+ -overloaded myocytes. these protective effects of paf depend on nitric oxide, but not activation of cgmp. in addition, we found that reversible s-nitrosylation of myocardial proteins must occur in order for paf to moderate ca2+ overload and loss of myocyte function. thus our data are consistent with the hypothesis that low-level paf receptor activation initiates nitric oxide-induced s-nitrosylation of ca2+ -handling proteins, e.g., l-type ca2+ channels, to attenuate ca2+ overload during ischemia-reperfusion in the heart. since inhibition of the paf protective pathway reduces myocardial postischemic function, our results raise concern that clinical therapies for inflammatory diseases that lead to complete blockade of the paf receptor may eliminate a significant, endogenous cardioprotective pathway. nitric oxide (no) can directly modulate cardiac contractility by accelerating relaxation and reducing diastolic tone. the intracellular mechanisms underlying these contractile effects are poorly understood. here we investigate the role of cyclic gmp‐dependent protein kinase (pkg) in the contractile response to exogenous no in rat ventricular myocytes. isolated ventricular myocytes were stimulated electrically and contractility was assessed by measuring cell shortening. some cells were loaded with the fluorescent ca2+ probe indo‐1 am for simultaneous assessment of the intracellular ca2+ transient. the no donor diethylamine nonoate (dea/no, 10 μm) significantly increased resting cell length, reduced twitch amplitude and accelerated time to 50 % relaxation (to 100.8 ± 0.2, 83.7 ± 3.0 and 88.9 ± 3.7 % of control values, respectively). the contractile effects of dea/no occurred without significant changes in the amplitude or kinetics of the intracellular ca2+ transient, suggesting that the myofilament response to ca2+ was reduced. these effects were abolished by inhibition of either guanylyl cyclase (with 1h‐[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3‐a]quinoxalin‐1‐one; odq, 10 μm) or pkg (with rp‐8‐br‐cgmps, 10 μm) suggesting that, at the concentration investigated, the effects of dea/no were mediated exclusively by pkg, following activation of guanylyl cyclase and elevation of cgmp. direct activation of pkg with 8‐pcpt‐cgmp (10 μm) mimicked the effects of dea/no (resting cell length and time to 50 % relaxation were 100.6 ± 0.1 and 90.5 ± 1.5 % of control values, respectively).the reduced myofilament ca2+ responsiveness was not attributable to an intracellular acidosis since the small reduction in phi induced by dea/no was found to be uncoupled from its contractile effects. however, hearts treated with dea/no (10 μm) showed a significant increase (1.4‐fold; p < 0.01) in troponin i phosphorylation compared to control, untreated hearts. these results suggest that the reduction in myofilament ca2+ responsiveness produced by dea/no results from phosphorylation of troponin i by pkg.
evidence as to how ace inhibitors attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury (ir) after cardioplegic arrest remains scarce. twenty-four rabbit hearts were perfused on a langendorff apparatus. control hearts (n = 6) were arrested with pure histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (htk)-bretschneider. treatment groups received added to the cardioplegic solution (n = 6) captopril (100 μmol/l) and losartan (100 μmol/l) for selective at1-receptor antagonism or bq123 (100 nmol/l) for selective eta-receptor antagonism. pre-ischemic equilibration of 45 min was followed by 90 min of cardioplegic arrest and 30 min of reperfusion. indices of myocardial contractility (lvp, dp/dt max, dp/dt min), coronary flow, heart rate, and o2 consumption were recorded before and after ischemic arrest. tissue adenosine triphosphate (atp) and malondialdehyde (mda) contents were measured to evaluate energy content and oxidative stress, respectively. after selective cardiac arrest with bretschneider, captopril-treated hearts showed improved hemodynamics compared to control and the other treatment groups. oxygen consumption was significantly decreased during early reperfusion in captopril-treated hearts (34 ± 3 μmol/min/g/mmhg) compared to controls and losartan- and bq123-treated hearts (controls: 77 ± 9 μmol/min/g/mmhg, p = 0.003; losartan: 54 ± 9 μmol/min/g/mmhg, p = 0.015; bq123: 64 ± 13 μmol/min/g/mmhg, p = 0.046). the atp content of the reperfused tissue was significantly elevated after captopril treatment compared to control group (24 ± 2 vs. 16 ± 2 μmol/g, p = 0.033), whereas the level of mda was substantially decreased (0.58 ± 0.163 vs. 1.5 ± 0.28 μmol/g, p = 0.009). ace inhibition leads to a significantly greater and faster recovery of myocardial contractility after prolonged cardiac arrest with bretschneider solution. due to decreased oxygen consumption, myocardial protection is enhanced. the association between ace and ischemia cannot be clarified by selective blockade of angiotensin-ii receptor type 1 (at1-r) or eta receptor (eta-r). background angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) produces angiotensin ii, causing vasoconstriction of coronary arteries and reduction of coronary blood flow. the present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that an ace inhibitor increases coronary blood flow and improves myocardial metabolic and contractile functions of ischemic myocardium.   methods and results in 65 open-chest dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused through an extracorporeal bypass tube from the left carotid artery. when cilazaprilat (3 micrograms/kg per minute) was infused into the bypass tube for 10 minutes after reduction of coronary blood flow due to partial occlusion of the bypass tube, coronary blood flow increased from 30 +/- 1 to 43 +/- 2 ml/100 g per minute despite there being no changes in coronary perfusion pressure (43 +/- 1 mm hg). the ratio of myocardial endocardial flow to epicardial flow increased during an infusion of cilazaprilat. both fractional shortening and lactate extraction ratio of the perfused area were increased (fractional shortening: 4.1 +/- 0.6% to 8.9 +/- 0.6%, p < .001; lactate extraction ratio: -55.7 +/- 3.3% to -36.7 +/- 3.9%, p < .001). during an infusion of cilazaprilat, the bradykinin concentration of coronary venous blood was markedly increased. the increased coronary blood flow due to cilazaprilat was attenuated by hoe-140 (an inhibitor of bradykinin receptors; coronary blood flow: 35 +/- 2 ml/100 g per minute), and by n omega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase; coronary blood flow: 34 +/- 2 ml/100 g per minute). intracoronary administration of bradykinin mimicked the beneficial effects of cilazaprilat. cyclic gmp content of the coronary artery was increased by cilazaprilat compared with the untreated condition in the ischemic myocardium. in the denervated hearts, the increased coronary blood flow due to cilazaprilat was not attenuated. on the other hand, cv11974, an inhibitor of angiotensin ii receptors, slightly increased coronary blood flow to 34 +/- 2 from 30 +/- 1 ml/100 g per minute.   conclusions we conclude that an inhibitor of ace can increase coronary blood flow and ameliorate myocardial ischemia, primarily due to accumulation of bradykinin and production of nitric oxide from the ischemic myocardium. inhibition of angiotensin ii production due to inhibition of ace partially contributes to coronary vasodilation in the ischemic myocardium.
epigenetic modifications of histones have been implicated in the regulation of cell specific expression of genes required for neuronal development. the best studied post-translational (epigenetic) modification of histones is the process of reversible acetylation. two types of enzymes - histone acetyltransferases (hats) and histone deacetylases (hdacs) establish and maintain specific patterns of histone acetylation in balance, thereby contributing to both transcriptional activation and repression of specific sets of genes. histone deacetylases catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from selected lysine residues in the conserved tails of core histone proteins and are considered as transcriptional corepressors. a significant amount of data implicates hdacs in diverse biological processes, including tissue specific developmental program by silencing specific growth-inhibitory genes. in line with this, gene disruption studies have shown that the class i deacetylases, hdac1 and hdac2 play an essential role in nervous system development. in the present review, we briefly highlight current insights supporting the function of histone deacetylases in rodent brain development and discuss present knowledge referring to their role in neurogenesis, taking into consideration results obtained in culture systems and in in vivo studies. histone deacetylases (hdacs) modulate chromatin structure and transcription, but little is known about their function in mammalian development. hdac1 was implicated previously in the repression of genes required for cell proliferation and differentiation. here we show that targeted disruption of both hdac1 alleles results in embryonic lethality before e10.5 due to severe proliferation defects and retardation in development. hdac1‐deficient embryonic stem cells show reduced proliferation rates, which correlate with decreased cyclin‐associated kinase activities and elevated levels of the cyclin‐dependent kinase inhibitors p21waf1/cip1 and p27kip1. similarly, expression of p21 and p27 is up‐regulated in hdac1‐null embryos. in addition, loss of hdac1 leads to significantly reduced overall deacetylase activity, hyperacetylation of a subset of histones h3 and h4 and concomitant changes in other histone modifications. the expression of hdac2 and hdac3 is induced in hdac1‐deficient cells, but cannot compensate for loss of the enzyme, suggesting a unique function for hdac1. our study provides the first evidence that a histone deacetylase is essential for unrestricted cell proliferation by repressing the expression of selective cell cycle inhibitors.
abstract context. variable demographic rates can manifest themselves between habitat types in the form of source–sink dynamics where populations in sink habitats would not exist without the addition of migrants from source habitats. aims. arctic ground squirrels (urocitellus parryii pleisus (osgood, 1900)) occupy a large geographic area in northern canada and live in a variety of habitat types, including boreal forest, low-elevation meadows and alpine meadows, providing an opportunity to investigate the possible existence of source–sink dynamics. methods. we hypothesised that arctic ground squirrels in the south-western yukon exhibit demographic characteristics indicative of source–sink dynamics. boreal forest habitat could be a sink in spite of previous high squirrel densities, whereas meadows could be a source. we investigated this by mark–recapture live-trapping and radio-telemetry. key results. in the boreal forest in the kluane region, we found reduced recruitment, reduced population growth rates (λ), and reduced survivorship for radio-collared individuals that moved from low-elevation meadows into the boreal forest. there was no evidence from radio-collared juveniles of dispersal from high-density ground squirrel populations in alpine meadows down into boreal forest. conclusions. boreal forest is a sink habitat for arctic ground squirrels. source–sink dynamics observed between low-elevation meadow and boreal forest habitats appear to result from increased predation pressure in the boreal forest. the result has been a near extirpation of boreal forest arctic ground squirrels in the kluane region since 1998. implications. because the source areas of low-elevation meadows occupy only 7–9% of the lowland habitat, recolonisation of boreal forest sites has been very slow. whereas alpine populations remain high in 2011, boreal forest populations remain near zero. alpine populations do not appear to be a source for the boreal forest. nous avons etudie les sousliks arctiques (urocitellus parryii plesius (osgood, 1900); anterieurement spermophilus parryii plesius osgood, 1900) dans trois types d'habitat distincts (la foret boreale, les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines) dans la region de kluane dans le sud-ouest du territoire du yukon, canada, de 2008 a 2010, afin de determiner si les populations de ces differents habitats presentaient des repartitions et des abondances specifiques aux habitats. on a demontre que leur abondance dans la foret boreale est synchronisee avec le cycle des lievres d'amerique (lepus americanus erxleben, 1777) dans la region a cause de leurs predateurs communs. nous avons predit que les populations dans la foret boreale devraient etre basses a cause du minimum actuel dans le cycle des lievres d'amerique, mais que les sousliks devraient etre relativement abondants dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines. les densites en fin d'ete differaient significativement entre les divers types d'habitats, avec 0,38 ± 0.13 souslik/ha (moyenne ± 1 es) dans l'habitat de foret boreale, 1,25 ± 0,22 souslik/ha dans l'habitat de prairie basse et 5,7 ± 0,22 sousliks/ha dans l'habitat de prairie alpine. en 2009, les populations ont ete extirpees de l'habitat de foret boreale, alors que les densites dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines etaient respectivement de 1,6 ± 0,34 souslik/ha et de 6,1 ± 0,7 sousliks/ha. l'absence actuelle de sousliks dans la foret boreale et la persistance des populations dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines laissent croire a l'existence d'une dynamique de type source-puits entre les types d'habitats de foret boreale et de prairie.
the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors for handball injuries in brazilian elite handball players. overall, 339 athletes from 21 handball teams who participated in the two main brazilian championships were followed up during a season. in total, 312 injuries were reported by 201 athletes. the injury incidence rate during training was 3.7/1000 h, and during matches was 20.3/1000 matches. ankle (19.4%, n = 46) and knee (13.5%, n = 32) were the body regions most affected by traumatic injuries. shoulders (44.0%, n = 33) and knee (26.7%, n = 20) were the body regions most affected by overuse injuries. muscle injuries (27.1%, n = 68) was the traumatic injury type most reported. tendinopathy (91.8%, n = 56) was the overuse injury type most observed. previous injury (or: 2.42, ci 95%: 1.51–3.89) and an additional match per week (or: 1.31, ci 95%: 1.05–1.62) were associated with a higher risk of overuse injury. female athletes (or: 1.56, ci 95%: 1.08–2.25) and an additional hour of training per week (or: 1.09, ci 95%: 1.02–1.15) were associated with a higher risk of traumatic injury. this study showed that athletes with previous injury have shown a high risk of developing an overuse injury. overuse injuries may represent as much of a problem as do acute injuries in many sports. this paper reviews key concepts related to the methodology for recording overuse symptoms. results from the fivb volleyball injury study were used to compare two different recording methods. the aim of this paper was to provide recommendations on how standardised methodology can be developed to quantify overuse injuries in surveillance studies. using beach volleyball data, a “traditional” cohort study approach using a time-loss injury definition suggested that injury risk was very low. in contrast, the data from a survey of past and present pain problems in the shoulder, knees and low back demonstrated that these were prevalent. the following recommendations are made: (1) studies should be prospective, with continuous or serial measurements of symptoms; (2) valid and sensitive scoring instruments need to be developed to measure pain and other relevant symptoms; (3) prevalence and not incidence should be used to report injury risk; (4) severity should be measured based on functional level and not time loss from sports. in conclusion, new approaches are needed to develop more appropriate methodology to quantify overuse injuries in studies.
we present a novel method for guiding a large-scale swarm of autonomous agents into a desired formation shape in a distributed and scalable manner. our probabilistic swarm guidance using inhomogeneous markov chains (psg-imc) algorithm adopts an eulerian framework, where the physical space is partitioned into bins and the swarm's density distribution over each bin is controlled. each agent determines its bin transition probabilities using a time-inhomogeneous markov chain. these time-varying markov matrices are constructed by each agent in real-time using the feedback from the current swarm distribution, which is estimated in a distributed manner. the psg-imc algorithm minimizes the expected cost of the transitions per time instant, required to achieve and maintain the desired formation shape, even when agents are added to or removed from the swarm. the algorithm scales well with a large number of agents and complex formation shapes. we demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed swarm guidance algorithm by using results of numerical simulations and hardware experiments with multiple quadrotors. swarm robotics is an approach to collective robotics that takes inspiration from the self-organized behaviors of social animals. through simple rules and local interactions, swarm robotics aims at designing robust, scalable, and flexible collective behaviors for the coordination of large numbers of robots. in this paper, we analyze the literature from the point of view of swarm engineering: we focus mainly on ideas and concepts that contribute to the advancement of swarm robotics as an engineering field and that could be relevant to tackle real-world applications. swarm engineering is an emerging discipline that aims at defining systematic and well founded procedures for modeling, designing, realizing, verifying, validating, operating, and maintaining a swarm robotics system. we propose two taxonomies: in the first taxonomy, we classify works that deal with design and analysis methods; in the second taxonomy, we classify works according to the collective behavior studied. we conclude with a discussion of the current limits of swarm robotics as an engineering discipline and with suggestions for future research directions.
during continuous user interaction, it is hard to provide rich visual feedback at interactive rates for datasets containing millions of entries. the contribution of this paper is a generic architecture that ensures responsiveness of the application even when dealing with large data and that is applicable to most types of information visualizations. our architecture builds on the separation of the main application thread and the visualization thread, which can be cancelled early due to user interaction. in combination with a layer mechanism, our architecture facilitates generating previews incrementally to provide rich visual feedback quickly. to help avoiding common pitfalls of multi-threading, we discuss synchronization and communication in detail. we explicitly denote design choices to control trade-offs. a quantitative evaluation based on the system vi s p l ore shows fast visual feedback during continuous interaction even for millions of entries. we describe instantiations of our architecture in additional tools. simvis is a novel technology for the interactive visual analysis of large and complex flow data which results from computational fluid dynamics (cfd) simulation. the new technology which has been researched and developed over the last years at the vrvis research center in vienna, introduces a new approach for interactive graphical exploration and analysis of time-dependent data (computed on large three-dimensional grids, and resulting in a multitude of different scalar/vector values for each cell of these grids). in this paper the major new technological concepts of the simvis approach are presented and real-world application examples are given.
dufulin is a newly developed antiviral agent (or pesticide) that activates systemic acquired resistance of plants. this pesticide is widely used in china to prevent abroad viral diseases in rice, tobacco and vegetables. in this study, the potential impacts such as soil type, moisture, temperature, and other factors on dufulin degradation in soil were investigated. degradation of dufulin followed the first-order kinetics. the half-life values varied from 2.27 to 150.68 days. the dissipation of dufulin was greatly affected by soil types, with dt50 (degradation half time) varying between 17.59, 31.36, and 43.32 days for eutric gleysols, cumulic anthrosols, and dystric regosols, respectively. the elevated moisture accelerated the decay of dufulin in soil. degradation of dufulin increased with temperature and its half-life values ranged from 16.66 to 42.79 days. sterilization of soils and treatment with h2o2 resulted in a 6- and 8-fold decrease in degradation rates compared to the control, suggesting that dufulin degradation was largely governed by microbial processes. under different light spectra, the most effective degradation occurred with 100-w uv light (dt50 = 2.27 days), followed by 15-w uv light (dt50 = 8.32 days) and xenon light (dt50 = 14.26 days). analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (lc-ms) revealed that 2-amino-4-methylbenzothiazole was one of the major decayed products of dufulin in soils, suggesting that elimination of diethyl phosphate and 2-fluorobenzaldehyde was most like the degradation pathway of dufulin in eutric gleysols. pentachlorophenol (pcp) contamination is a severe environmental problem due to its widespread occurrence, toxicity and recalcitrance. in order to gain a better understanding of the fate of pcp in soils, the role of the soil organic matter (som) and clay minerals in the pcp sorption-desorption was studied on two bulk field soils, two subsoils (i.e., som or clay-removed soil) and two artificial soils. the two field soils used were a silty loam from new mexico (nm) containing 10% clay and a sandy-clay-loam from colombia (co) south america comprised of 18% clay minerals. the bulk co soil containing kaolinite sorbed significantly less pcp than the nm soil. all soils depicted an apparent hysteresis during sorption. the co bulk and subsoils desorbed 14-20% and 15-26% of the sorbed pcp respectively whereas the nm bulk and subsoils desorbed only 4-12% and 5-16%, respectively. experiments conducted with pure clay and artificial soils indicated that the expandable clay minerals were key sorbent material. additional studies to investigate the interaction between som and clay minerals are needed to fully understand sorptive phenomena.
pharmacological properties exhibited by latex of plants are due to various biologically active compounds including several proteolytic enzymes. present study evaluates hemostatic potential of tabernaemontana divaricata and artocarpus altilis from apocynaceae and moraceae families respectively. the latex of these plants were initially subjected to dialysis and crude extracts were estimated for proteolytic activity using casein as the substrate. mean caseinolytic activity for 100 μg of latex protein was found to be 56.16 ± 0.57 and 45 ± 0.3 u/h for t. divaricata and a. altilis respectively. caseinolytic activity by both the plant extracts was higher than standard proteases, papain and trypsin. however the difference was significant (p < 0.05) with papain alone. crude enzymes (ce) from both plants exhibited coagulant activity on human platelet poor plasma by recalcification time. a significant reduction in clotting time was exhibited by t. divaricata compared to a. altilis (p < 0.05). these results were further substantiated with fibrinogen agarose plate assay. crude enzyme of both plants also hydrolyzed blood clot. mean % of thrombolysis by t. divaricata was 80.75 ± 1.2 and that of a. altilis was 70.24 ± 1.52. inhibition studies confirmed cysteine protease nature of ce. comparative analysis revealed t. divaricata to be the best among the two for its hemostatic potential. this study scientifically validates the use of latex from these plants in the management of fresh cuts or wounds. latex glycoprotein (lgp) from synadenium grantii latex was purified by the combination of heat precipitation and gel permeation chromatography. lgp is a heat stable protein even at 80 degrees c showed a sharp single band both in sds-page as well as in native (acidic) page. lgp is a monomeric protein appears as single band under reducing condition. it is a less hydrophobic protein showed sharp single peak in rp-hplc with retention time of 13.3 m. the relative molecular mass of lgp is 34.4 kda. cd spectrum of lgp explains less content of alpha-helix (7%), and high content of beta-pleated sheets (48%) and random coils (46%). the n-terminal sequence of lgp is d-f-p-s-d-w-y-a-y-e-g-y-v-i-d-r-p-f-s. purified lgp is a fibrinogen degrading protease hydrolyses all the three subunits in the order of aalpha, bbeta and gamma. the hydrolytic pattern is totally different from plasmin as well as thrombin. lgp reduces recalcification time from 165 to 30 s with citrated human plasma but did not show thrombin like as well as factor xa-like activity. although lgp induces procoagulant activity, it hydrolyses partially cross-linked fibrin clot. it hydrolyses all the subunits of partially cross-linked fibrin clot (alpha- chains, beta-chain and gamma-gamma dimer). lgp is a serine protease, inhibited by pmsf. other serine protease inhibitors, aprotinin and leupeptin did not inhibit the caseinolytic activity as well as fibrinogenolytic activity. we report purification and characterization of a glycoprotein from synadenium grantii latex with human fibrino(geno)lytic activity.
restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviours, interests, or activities are a critical diagnostic criterion for autism spectrum disorder (asd). previous studies using gambling paradigms with asd populations have identified that, unlike typically developed control participants, people with a diagnosis of asd tend to maintain particular response patterns regardless of the magnitude of potential outcomes to uncertain gains or losses. here we designed a gambling test that permitted calculation of the response consistency in gambling choices in situations that presented varying expected outcomes in terms of gains or losses. the task was administered to 33 adults with a diagnosis of asds and compared to a group of 47 typically-developed (td) control participants who were matched for age and iq. when presented with choices where participants could either make a risky gamble or a safe choice in terms of gains or losses (e.g., 20% chance of winning £5 vs. 100% chance of winning £1), the asd participants did not differ from the tds in their overall risk-taking behaviour. however, they were more consistent in their individual choices from trial to trial. furthermore, the proportion of participants who either implemented an invariate response strategy (e.g., either always choosing the most risky or most “safe” option) was significantly higher in the asd group compared with the controls. additionally, while the asd group were slower to make their responses in the win frame and the first half of the lose frame, by the end of the task their decision times were the same as the td controls. these findings suggest that the asd tendency towards repetitive behaviour may demonstrate itself even in high-level decision-making tasks, which needs to be understood if we are to be sure what such tasks are measuring. the emotional responses elicited by the way options are framed often results in lack of logical consistency in human decision making. in this study, we investigated subjects with autism spectrum disorder (asd) using a financial task in which the monetary prospects were presented as either loss or gain. we report both behavioral evidence that asd subjects show a reduced susceptibility to the framing effect and psycho-physiological evidence that they fail to incorporate emotional context into the decision-making process. on this basis, we suggest that this insensitivity to contextual frame, although enhancing choice consistency in asd, may also underpin core deficits in this disorder. these data highlight both benefits and costs arising from multiple decision processes in human cognition.
adenylate kinase 1 is responsible for the conversion of amp into adp involved in purine metabolism. in the present study, adenylate kinase 1 gene (csadk1) was isolated from an adult cdna library of clonorchis sinensis, and the recombinant protein was expressed in escherichia coli. bioinformatics analysis implied that the putative protein contained 197 amino acids, and some residues in conservative binding sites of csadk1 were substituted. the structure modeling analysis showed that csadk1 was composed of a core domain, an nmp-binding domain, and a lid domain, which was just a small loop. it demonstrated that csadk1 was a short isoform of adks. moreover, csadk1 was identified as an excretory/secretory product by western blot analysis. real-time quantitative pcr showed that expression level of csadk1 at the stage of excysted metacercaria was higher than those of adult worm (18.8-folds, p < 0.01), metacercariae (1.5-folds, p < 0.01), and eggs (5.6-folds, p < 0.01). in addition, histochemistry analysis showed that csadk1 was extensively distributed in metacercariae and in the vitellaria and eggs of adult worms. the km and vmax value for substrate adp were 2.2 mm and 0.9 mm/min, respectively. the optimal temperature and ph value were 37 °c and from 7.5 to 8.0, respectively. the enzyme activity was highly dependent on mg2+, and the optimal concentration of mg2+ was 2 mm. however, the enzyme activity was slightly activated by ca2+, and mn2+ has no effect on activity. for monovalent ions, activity was highly activated by k+ and nh4+, but slightly by li+. taken together, csadk1 was a metal ion-dependent enzyme involved in purine metabolism, which was important for development and reproduction, and might be a potential candidate for drug target for clonorchiasis. the hydrogenosomal enzyme atp:amp phosphotransferase (adenylate kinase) (ec 2.7.4.3) was purified to apparent homogeneity from the bovine parasite tritrichomonas foetus. a fraction enriched for hydrogenosomes was obtained from cell homogenates which had been subjected to differential and isopycnic centrifugation. adenylate kinase was solubilized in 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.3, containing 0.8% triton x-100, and purified by sequential affi-gel blue affinity chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography gel filtration. the purified enzyme, a monomer of mr 29,000, exhibited km values of 100, 195, and 83 microm for adp, atp, and amp, respectively. substituting other mono-, di-, and trinucleotides for amp, adp, and atp gave less than half the maximal activity. full enzyme activity requires mg2+, but mn2+ and co2+ yield half maximal activity. the enzyme has a broad optimal ph range between ph 6 and 9. the enzyme was competitively inhibited by p1,p5-di(adenosine-5')pentaphosphate, a specific adenylate kinase inhibitor: the ki was 150 nm. the enzyme was also inhibited with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and this inhibition could be reversed by the addition of 2 mm dithiothreitol. t. foetus adenylate kinase has similar catalytic and physical properties to that of the biologically closely related human parasite trichomonas vaginalis.
backgroundsmall interfering rnas (sirnas) have become an important tool in cell and molecular biology. reliable design of sirna molecules is essential for the needs of large functional genomics projects.resultsto improve the design of efficient sirna molecules, we performed a comparative, thermodynamic and correlation analysis on a heterogeneous set of 653 sirnas collected from the literature. we used this training set to select sirna features and optimize computational models. we identified 18 parameters that correlate significantly with silencing efficiency. some of these parameters characterize only the sirna sequence, while others involve the whole mrna. most importantly, we derived an sirna position-dependent consensus, and optimized the free-energy difference of the 5' and 3' terminal dinucleotides of the sirna antisense strand. the position-dependent consensus is based on correlation and t-test analyses of the training set, and accounts for both significantly preferred and avoided nucleotides in all sequence positions. on the training set, the two parameters' correlation with silencing efficiency was 0.5 and 0.36, respectively. among other features, a dinucleotide content index and the frequency of potential targets for sirna in the mrna added predictive power to our model (r = 0.55). we showed that our model is effective for predicting the efficiency of sirnas at different concentrations.we optimized a neural network model on our training set using three parameters characterizing the sirna sequence, and predicted efficiencies for the test sirna dataset recently published by novartis. on this validation set, the correlation coefficient between predicted and observed efficiency was 0.75. using the same model, we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis of optimal sirna targets for 22,600 human mrnas.conclusionwe demonstrated that the properties of the sirnas themselves are essential for efficient rna interference. the 5' ends of antisense strands of efficient sirnas are u-rich and possess a content similarity to the pyrimidine-rich oligonucleotides interacting with the polypurine rna tracks that are recognized by rnase h. the advantage of our method over similar methods is the small number of parameters. as a result, our method requires a much smaller training set to produce consistent results. other mrna features, though expensive to compute, can slightly improve our model. the crystal structure based model of the catalytic center of ago2 revealed that the sirna and the mrna must be able to form an a-helix for correct positing of the scissile phosphate bond for cleavage in rnai. this suggests that base pairing of the target mrna with itself, i.e. secondary structure, must be removed before cleavage. early on in the sirna design, gc-rich target sites were avoided because of their potential to be involved in strong secondary structure. it is still unclear how important a factor mrna secondary structure is in rnai. however, it has been established that a difference in the thermostability of the ends of an sirna duplex dictate which strand is loaded into the rna-induced silencing complex. here, we use a novel secondary structure prediction method and duplex-end differential calculations to investigate the importance of a secondary structure in the sirna design. we found that the differential duplex-end stabilities alone account for functional prediction of 60% of the 80 sirna sites examined, and that secondary structure predictions improve the prediction of site efficacy. a total of 80% of the non-functional sites can be eliminated using secondary structure predictions and duplex-end differential.
introduction recent studies have demonstrated that inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines (iiv) may elicit production of heterosubtypic antibodies, which can neutralize avian h5n1 virus in a small proportion of subjects. we hypothesized that prime boost regimens of live and inactivated trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines (laiv and iiv) would enhance production of heterosubtypic immunity and provide evidence of cross-protection against other influenza viruses. methods in an open-label study, 26 adult volunteers were randomized to receive one of four vaccine regimens containing two doses of 2009-10 seasonal influenza vaccines administered 8 (±1) weeks apart: 2 doses of laiv; 2 doses of iiv; laiv then iiv; iiv then laiv. humoral immunity assays for avian h5n1, 2009 pandemic h1n1 (ph1n1), and seasonal vaccine strains were performed on blood collected pre-vaccine and 2 and 4 weeks later. the percentage of cytokine-producing t-cells was compared with baseline 14 days after each dose. results subjects receiving iiv had prompt serological responses to vaccine strains. two subjects receiving heterologous prime boost regimens had enhanced haemagglutination inhibition (hi) and neutralization (nt) titres against ph1n1, and one subject against avian h5n1; all three had pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies detected at baseline. significantly elevated titres to h5n1 and ph1n1 by neuraminidase inhibition (ni) assay were observed following laiv-iiv administration. both vaccines elicited cross-reactive cd4+ t-cell responses to nucleoprotein of avian h5n1 and ph1n1. all regimens were safe and well tolerated. conclusion neither homologous nor heterologous prime boost immunization enhanced serum hi and nt titres to 2009 ph1n1 or avian h5n1 compared to single dose vaccine. however heterologous prime-boost vaccination did lead to in vitro evidence of cross-reactivity by ni; the significance of this finding is unclear. these data support the strategy of administering single dose trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine at the outset of an influenza pandemic while a specific vaccine is being developed. trial registration clinicaltrials.gov nct01044095 although scarce after annual influenza vaccination, b cells producing antibodies capable of neutralizing multiple influenza strains are abundant in humans infected with pandemic 2009 h1n1 influenza.
objective the opioid growth factor (ogf) and its receptor (ogfr), serve as inhibitory axis regulating cell proliferation in normal cells and cancer. we investigated the presence and relative expression of ogf and ogfr in normal human ovarian surface epithelial (hose) cells, benign ovarian cysts, and ovarian cancers.   methods surgical samples of 16 patients with ovarian cancer and 27 patients with ovarian benign cysts were obtained intraoperatively. hose were collected by scraping the surface of normal ovaries of 10 post menopausal women undergoing hysterectomy and oophorectomy. semiquantitative immunohistochemistry was used to assess the presence, distribution, and levels of ogf and ogfr. receptor binding assays measured binding capacity and affinity of ogfr for radiolabeled ogf.   results ogf and ogfr were present in hose cells, ovarian cysts, and ovarian cancers. compared to hose cells, ogf and ogfr protein levels were reduced 29% and 34% (p<0.001), respectively, in ovarian cysts, and decreased 58% and 48% (p<0.001), respectively, in ovarian cancers. binding assays revealed 5.4 fold fewer ogfr binding sites in cancers than cysts (p<0.05). levels of ogf and ogfr were comparable in primary, metastatic, or recurrent ovarian cancers.   conclusion we have shown that a native opioid pathway, the ogf-ogfr axis, is present in human ovarian cancer. importantly, the expression of ogf and ogfr is diminished in human ovarian cancer. as ogf and ogfr normally function in maintaining cell proliferation, therapy to harness ogf/ogfr function could provide a useful biologic-based treatment for human ovarian cancer. opioid growth factor (ogf) is an endogenous pentapeptide that inhibits growth of human pancreatic cancer cells in culture, as well as xenografts in nude mice. to establish the maximum tolerated dose (mtd), and determine safety and toxicity of ogf, a phase i trial was performed in patients with advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma were treated with escalating doses of ogf for 30 min i.v. to determine the mtd. the s.c. route of administration also was evaluated. once the mtd was established, a group of patients was treated chronically, and monitored for safety and toxicity. hypotension was the dose-limiting toxicity, resulting in a mtd of 250 μg/kg i.v. due to limited solubility of ogf in small volumes, a maximum dose of 50 μg/kg twice daily was determined by the s.c. route of administration. no adverse events were reported for oxygen saturation, cardiac rhythm, laboratory values or neurological status in either the acute or chronic parts of the study with the i.v. or s.c. routes. during the chronic i.v. phase, two subjects had resolution of liver metastases and one showed regression of the pancreatic tumor. mean survival from the time of diagnosis was 8.7 months (range 2–23 months) in the i.v. group and 9.5 months (range 1–18 months) in the s.c. group. we conclude that ogf can be safely administered to patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of ogf alone or in combination with present modes of therapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

the cea-related cell adhesion molecule 1, ceacam1, is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of human granulocytes and lymphocytes, endothelia, and many epithelia. ceacam1 is involved in the regulation of important biological processes, such as tumor growth, angiogenesis, and modulation of the immune response. ceacam1, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily carries several lewis x (lex) structures as we recently demonstrated by mass spectrometry of native ceacam1 from human granulocytes. since lex residues of pathogens bind to the c-type lectin dendritic cell-specific icam-3 grabbing nonintegrin (dc-sign) expressed on human dcs, we hypothesized that lex glycans of ceacam1 are recognized by dc-sign. here, we demonstrate that ceacam1, the major carrier of lex residues in human granulocytes, is specifically recognized by dc-sign via lex residues mediating the internalization of ceacam1 into immature dcs. expression studies with ceacam1 in combination with different fucosyltransferases (futs) revealed that futix plays a key role in the synthesis of lex groups of ceacam1. as lex groups on ceacam1 are selectively attached and specifically interact with dc-sign, our findings suggest that ceacam1 participates in immune regulation in physiological conditions and in pathological conditions, such as inflammation, autoimmune disease, and cancer. both the dendritic cell receptor dc-sign and the closely related endothelial cell receptor dc-signr bind human immunodeficiency virus and enhance infection. however, biochemical and structural comparison of these receptors now reveals that they have very different physiological functions. by screening an extensive glycan array, we demonstrated that dc-sign and dc-signr have distinct ligand-binding properties. our structural and mutagenesis data explain how both receptors bind high-mannose oligosaccharides on enveloped viruses and why only dc-sign binds blood group antigens, including those present on microorganisms. dc-sign mediates endocytosis, trafficking as a recycling receptor and releasing ligand at endosomal ph, whereas dc-signr does not release ligand at low ph or mediate endocytosis. thus, whereas dc-sign has dual ligand-binding properties and functions both in adhesion and in endocytosis of pathogens, dc-signr binds a restricted set of ligands and has only the properties of an adhesion receptor.
the problem of estimating a full brdf from partial observations has already been studied using either parametric or non-parametric approaches. the goal in each case is to best match this sparse set of input measurements. in this paper we address the problem of inferring higher order reflectance information starting from the minimal input of a single brdf slice. we begin from the prototypical case of a homogeneous sphere, lit by a head-on light source, which only holds information about less than 0.001% of the whole brdf domain. we propose a novel method to infer the higher dimensional properties of the material's brdf, based on the statistical distribution of known material characteristics observed in real-life samples. we evaluated our method based on a large set of experiments generated from real-world brdfs and newly measured materials. although inferring higher dimensional brdfs from such modest training is not a trivial problem, our method performs better than state-of-the-art parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric approaches. finally, we discuss interesting applications on material re-lighting, and flash-based photography. the society for imaging science and technology (imaging.org) is an international professional society whose mission is to keep members and others aware of the latest scientific and technological developments in the greater field of imaging. a major objective of the wiley-is&t series is to advance this goal at the professional level. the broad scope of the series focuses on imaging in all its aspects, with particular emphasis on digital printing, electronic imaging, image assessment and reproduction, image archiving and preservation, color science, pre-press technologies, and hybrid imaging systems. fairchild co lo r a ppea r a n ce m o d ls color appearance models third edition mark d. fairchild rochester institute of technology, usa
the voltage-gated k(+) channel kv1.3 has been reported to regulate transmitter release in select central and peripheral neurons. in this study, we evaluated its role at the synapse between visceral sensory afferents and secondary neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (nts). we identified mrna and protein for kv1.3 in rat nodose ganglia using rt-pcr and western blot analysis. in immunohistochemical experiments, anti-kv1.3 immunoreactivity was very strong in internal organelles in the soma of nodose neurons with a weaker distribution near the plasma membrane. anti-kv1.3 was also identified in the axonal branches that project centrally, including their presynaptic terminals in the medial and commissural nts. in current-clamp experiments, margatoxin (mgtx), a high-affinity blocker of kv1.3, produced an increase in action potential duration in c-type but not a- or ah-type neurons. to evaluate the role of kv1.3 at the presynaptic terminal, we examined the effect of mgtx on tract evoked monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (epscs) in brain slices of the nts. mgtx increased the amplitude of evoked epscs in a subset of neurons, with the major increase occurring during the first stimuli in a 20-hz train. these data, together with the results from somal recordings, support the hypothesis that kv1.3 regulates the duration of the action potential in the presynaptic terminal of c fibers, limiting transmitter release to the postsynaptic cell. the active and passive membrane properties of rabbit nodose ganglion cells and their responsiveness to depolarizing agents have been examined in vitro. neurons with an axonal conduction velocity of less than 3 m/s were classified as c-cells and the remainder as a-cells. mean axonal conduction velocities of a- and c-cells were 16.4 m/s and 0.99 m/s, respectively. a-cells had action potentials of brief duration (1.16 ms), high rate of rise (385 v/s), an overshoot of 23 mv, and relatively high spike following frequency (sff). c-cells typically had action potentials with a "humped" configuration (duration 2.51 ms), lower rate of rise (255 v/s), an overshoot of 28.6 mv, an after potential of longer duration than a-cells, and relatively low sff. eight of 15 a-cells whose axons conducted at less than 10 m/s had action potentials of longer duration with a humped configuration; these were termed ah-cells. they formed about 10% of cells whose axons conducted above 2.5 m/s. the soma action potential of a-cells was blocked by tetrodotoxin (ttx), but that of 6/11 c-cells was unaffected by ttx. typically, a-cells showed strong delayed (outward) rectification on passage of depolarizing current through the soma membrane and time-dependent (inward) rectification on inward current passage. input resistance was thus highly sensitive to membrane potential close to rest. in c-cells, delayed rectification was not marked, and slight time-dependent rectification occurred in only 3 of 25 cells; i/v curves were normally linear over the range: resting potential to 40 mv more negative. data on ah-cells were incomplete, but in our sample of eight cells time-dependent rectification was absent or mild. c-cells had a higher input resistance and a higher neuronal capacitance than a-cells. in a proportion of a-cells, rn was low at resting potential (5 m omega) but increased as the membrane was hyperpolarized by a few millivolts. a-cells were depolarized by gaba but were normally unaffected by 5-ht or dmpp. c-cells were depolarized by gaba in a similar manner to a-cells but also responded strongly to 5-ht; 53/66 gave a depolarizing response, and 3/66, a hyperpolarizing response. of c-cells, 75% gave a depolarizing response to dmpp.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
the developmental pattern of apolipoprotein vldl-ii (apo-ii) in the plasma with regard to lipid concentration was characterized during the transition of pullet females to the laying phase in commercial laying hens (gallus domesticus). apo-ii was isolated from the plasma of estrogen-administered roosters, and a rapid elisa was developed for its quantification in chickens. the sensitivity of the assay was 5 ng/ml, and the inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were 4 and 8%, respectively. whereas no detectable levels of apo-ii could be monitored in the blood plasma of immature chickens, the level increased slightly to 23 weeks of age and sharply at the onset of lay. this profile reflects the dramatic changes in lipid metabolism at the onset of lay, and concurs with the concentration of total lipids in the plasma and with egg production rate. plasma apo-ii of 2 laying strains differing in body weights but compared at approximately similar egg production rates, tended to be slightly higher in heavy vs light-weight type hens. oogenesis was speculated to be the main factor affecting both apo-ii and total lipid profiles in chicken plasma, enabling efficient delivery of vldl to the egg. at onset of egg-laying in the chicken, plasma levels of apolipoprotein vldl-ii (apoii) increase dramatically, suggesting a function of apoii in yolk deposition of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. thus, the possibility that this female-specific homodimeric protein (mr of subunit, 9500) is recognized by the oocyte receptor for low and very low density lipoproteins was investigated. apoii was purified from very low density lipoproteins by a novel, rapid procedure and reconstituted with egg phosphatidylcholine (pc) by detergent-dialysis. the resulting discoidal apoii/pc lipoprotein particles contained 3 mg of apoii per mg of pc and had a buoyant density of 1.062 g/ml. the ability of apoii/pc, as well as of physiological particles containing apoii but devoid of apolipoprotein b (apob), namely high density lipoproteins (hdl) from laying hens, to interact with the oocyte receptor was tested. both of these ligands failed to show saturable high affinity binding, in contrast to the apob-containing ligands, low and very low density lipoproteins. furthermore, neither laying-hen hdl which contain apoii and apoa-i nor apoii/pc were able to displace receptor-bound apob-containing lipoproteins, as shown in competitive binding assays as well as by ligand blotting. thus, we conclude that apob, but not apoii, participates in binding and uptake of very low density lipoproteins via receptor-mediated endocytosis by growing chicken oocytes.
pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (pph) is a significant bacterial pathogen of agricultural crops, and phage φ6 and other members of the dsrna virus family cystoviridae undergo lytic (virulent) infection of pph, using the type iv pilus as the initial site of cellular attachment. despite the popularity of pph/phage φ6 as a model system in evolutionary biology, pph resistance to phage φ6 remains poorly characterized. to investigate differences between phage φ6 resistant pph strains, we examined genomic and gene expression variation among three bacterial genotypes that differ in the number of type iv pili expressed per cell: ordinary (wild-type), non-piliated, and super-piliated. genome sequencing of non-piliated and super-piliated pph identified few mutations that separate these genotypes from wild type pph–and none present in genes known to be directly involved in type iv pilus expression. expression analysis revealed that 81.1% of gene ontology (go) terms up-regulated in the non-piliated strain were down-regulated in the super-piliated strain. this differential expression is particularly prevalent in genes associated with respiration—specifically genes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (tca) cycle, aerobic respiration, and acetyl-coa metabolism. the expression patterns of the tca pathway appear to be generally up and down-regulated, in non-piliated and super-piliated pph respectively. as pilus retraction is mediated by an atp motor, loss of retraction ability might lead to a lower energy draw on the bacterial cell, leading to a different energy balance than wild type. the lower metabolic rate of the super-piliated strain is potentially a result of its loss of ability to retract. the genome of the lipid-containing bacteriophage phi 6 contains three segments of double-stranded rna. we have determined the nucleotide sequence of cdna derived from the middle-size rna segment. the coding sequences of three proteins on this segment were identified on the basis of size and the correlation of predicted n-terminal amino acid sequences with those found through the analysis of isolated proteins. in contrast to our results with the small phi 6 dsrna segment, the open reading frames are not tightly clustered. the homologous terminal noncoding regions between the middle and small dsrna segments are found to be more extensive than rna sequencing had previously indicated.
summary imprinted genes are regulated according to parental origin and can influence embryonic growth and metabolism and confer disease susceptibility. here, we designed sensitive allele-specific reporters to non-invasively monitor imprinted cdkn1c expression in mice and showed that expression was modulated by environmental factors encountered in utero. acute exposure to chromatin-modifying drugs resulted in de-repression of paternally inherited (silent) cdkn1c alleles in embryos that was temporary and resolved after birth. in contrast, deprivation of maternal dietary protein in utero provoked permanent de-repression of imprinted cdkn1c expression that was sustained into adulthood and occurred through a folate-dependent mechanism of dna methylation loss. given the function of imprinted genes in regulating behavior and metabolic processes in adults, these results establish imprinting deregulation as a credible mechanism linking early-life adversity to later-life outcomes. furthermore, cdkn1c-luciferase mice offer non-invasive tools to identify factors that disrupt epigenetic processes and strategies to limit their long-term impact. monoallelic expression of imprinted genes is generally associated with differential methylation. methylation may be inherited as the gametic imprinting mark or may be acquired postfertilization. here, we characterize a differentially methylated region associated with the mouse cdkn1c gene and find that it is confined to a cpg island that begins 600 bp 5' of the promoter and extends into the transcription unit. our analysis indicates that methylation of this region is not inherited from sperm, is acquired specifically on the paternal allele following implantation, and is dependent on kvdmr1. we further demonstrate that although methylation is required for maintaining silencing of the paternal cdkn1c allele, it is not a prerequisite for the establishment of monoallelic expression at this locus. prior to the onset of differential methylation, additional epigenetic modifications must play a role in distinguishing the parental alleles of cdkn1c and influencing their expression.
loss of muscle mass occurs in a variety of diseases, including cancer, chronic heart failure, aquired immunodeficiency syndrome, diabetes, and renal failure, often aggravating pathological progression. preventing muscle wasting by promoting muscle growth has been proposed as a possible therapeutic approach. myostatin is an important negative modulator of muscle growth during myogenesis, and myostatin inhibitors are attractive drug targets. however, the role of the myostatin pathway in adulthood and the transcription factors involved in the signaling are unclear. moreover, recent results confirm that other transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) members control muscle mass. using genetic tools, we perturbed this pathway in adult myofibers, in vivo, to characterize the downstream targets and their ability to control muscle mass. smad2 and smad3 are the transcription factors downstream of myostatin/tgf-beta and induce an atrophy program that is muscle ring-finger protein 1 (murf1) independent. furthermore, smad2/3 inhibition promotes muscle hypertrophy independent of satellite cells but partially dependent of mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) signaling. thus myostatin and akt pathways cross-talk at different levels. these findings point to myostatin inhibitors as good drugs to promote muscle growth during rehabilitation, especially when they are combined with igf-1-akt activators. myostatin is a transforming growth factor-β family member that acts as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass. to identify possible myostatin inhibitors that may have applications for promoting muscle growth, we investigated the regulation of myostatin signaling. myostatin protein purified from mammalian cells consisted of a noncovalently held complex of the n-terminal propeptide and a disulfide-linked dimer of c-terminal fragments. the purified c-terminal myostatin dimer was capable of binding the activin type ii receptors, act riib and, to a lesser extent, act riia. binding of myostatin to act riib could be inhibited by the activin-binding protein follistatin and, at higher concentrations, by the myostatin propeptide. to determine the functional significance of these interactions in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing high levels of the propeptide, follistatin, or a dominant-negative form of act riib by using a skeletal muscle-specific promoter. independent transgenic mouse lines for each construct exhibited dramatic increases in muscle mass comparable to those seen in myostatin knockout mice. our findings suggest that the propeptide, follistatin, or other molecules that block signaling through this pathway may be useful agents for enhancing muscle growth for both human therapeutic and agricultural applications.
background birthweight differences in twin pairs influence their perinatal outcome as well as growth and development. growth-discordant twins have not been well characterized in our local environment.   objective to determine the frequency of birthweight discordance in live-born twin pairs and document some factors that may influence it.   methods in this cross-sectional study, 104 live-born twin pairs were recruited and their intrapair birthweight differences were determined. twin pairs whose birthweight difference was 15% or more, using the larger infant as the growth standard, were designated as discordant. the maternal age, parity, and birth order of the heavier twin were noted.   results the prevalence of birthweight discordance was 28.8% when a 15% cut-off point was used but dropped to 9.6% when a 25% cut-off point was applied. grand multiparity was associated with a significantly increased risk of delivery of discordant twins. same-sex twin pairs accounted for 60% of all cases of birthweight discordance.   conclusion birthweight discordance is common in twin gestations in benin city, especially among grand multiparous women. objective to challenge the hypothesis that discordant growth is a normal variation by relating birth weight discordance to total twin birth weight. method among 12,565 israeli live-born twin pairs (1993–98), we compared total twin birth weight decile, the frequencies of three levels of discordance in the general population, over 25% discordance between like- versus unlike-sex pairs, and over 25% discordance between pairs delivered by primiparas versus multiparas. results we found a marked change in the best-fit correlation function with increased discordance: level 15–24.9% was inversely linear whereas levels 25–34.9% and over 34.9% were inversely logarithmic (r2 = .47, .88, and .9, respectively). the best-fit correlation of frequencies of more than 25% discordance was inversely logarithmic and similar in like-and unlike-sexed twins across deciles functions (p = .7, odds ratio [or] 1.0, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.9, 1.2). the overall frequencies of discordance were also similar (9.3% versus 10.2%, p = .11, or 0.9, 95% ci 0.8, 1.0). the frequencies of primiparas decreased linearly (r2 = .98) and the frequencies of more than 25% discordant pairs in multiparas and primiparas across the deciles had similar inversely logarithmic patterns (p = .55, or 1.0, 95% ci 0.9, 1.2). discordance over 25% was significantly more frequent among primiparas (p < .001, or 1.45, 95% ci 1.3, 1.6). conclusion the observed patterns of birth weight discordance did not substantiate normal variation but an adaptive growth restriction that might explain why the likelihood of discordant growth decreases as total twin birth weight increases.
exclusive breast-feeding until 6 months is advised by the who as the best practice to feed infants. yet, some studies have suggested a gap between energy requirements and the energy provided by human milk for many infants at 6 months. in order to assess the adequacy of who recommendations in 6-month-old senegalese lactating infants, a comprehensive study was designed to measure human milk intake by the dose-to-the mother 2h2o turnover method. infants' energy intakes were calculated using daily breast milk intake and the energy content of milk was estimated on the basis of creamatocrit. of the fifty-nine mother–infant pairs enrolled, fifteen infants were exclusively breast-fed (ex) while forty-four were partially breast-fed (part). infants' breast milk intake was significantly higher in the ex group (993 (sd 135) g/d, n 15) compared with the part group (828 (sd 222) g/d, n 44, p= 0·009). breast milk energy content as well as infants' growth was comparable in both groups. however, infants' energy intake from human milk was significantly higher (364 (sd 50) kj/kg per d (2586 (sd 448) kj/d)) in the ex group than in the part group (289 (sd 66) kj/kg per d (2150 (sd 552) kj/d), p< 0·01). compared with who recommendations, the results demonstrate that energy intake from breast milk was low in partially breast-fed infants while exclusively breast-fed 6-month-old senegalese infants received adequate energy from human milk alone, the most complete food for infants. therefore, advocacy of exclusive breast-feeding until 6 months should be strengthened. objective: to measure the lipid content and the fatty acid (fa) composition of breast milk as part of a nutritional survey of the essential fatty acid (efa) status of 5 months old congolese infants.design: cross sectional nutrition survey.setting: a suburban district of brazzaville (capital of the congo).subjects: a random sample of nursing mothers and their 5 months old infants (n=102).data collection procedures: the mothers were questionned on their socio-economic status, dietary habits, and their body mass index (bmi) was measured. breast milk samples were collected from each mother. milk lipid content and fatty acid composition were determined.results: compared with milk from various countries, congolese women's mature breast milk was low in lipid (28.70±11.33 g/l) but rich in 8:0–14:0 fas (25.97±8.17% of total fas) and in polyunsaturated fas (pufas), particularly n-3 pufas (2.39±0.68% of total fas, mainly 18:3 and 22:6). this was associated with the frequent consumption of high-carbohydrate foods (processed cassava roots, wheat bread, doughnuts) known to enhance 8:0–14:0 fa biosynthesis, and with that of foods providing n-6 and n-3 efas such as freshwater and saltwater fish, vegetable oil, green leafy vegetables, and high-fat fruit (peanuts, avocado, bushbutter). these foods were traditionally and locally produced. milk lipid content was negatively related with mothers' bmi (p<0.01) and varied with the frequency of consumption of certain foods corresponding to distinct dietary patterns.conclusions: lipid content and fa composition of congolese breast milk were dependent on mother's nutritional status. however, despite an adequate efa composition of breast milk, partially breast-fed 5 months old congolese infants probably did not get enough n-6 and n-3 efas from breast milk to meet their efa requirements.sponsorship: supported in part by the french ministry of research (contract no. 92.l.0728) and inra (institut national de la recherche agronomique).
objective tissue fibrosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in systemic sclerosis (ssc), and an increasing number of promising molecular targets for antifibrotic therapies have been described recently. transforming growth factor beta (tgfbeta) is well known to be the principal factor that leads to tissue fibrosis. the present study was undertaken to investigate the ability of hsc025, a novel small compound that antagonizes tgfbeta/smad signaling through the activation of nuclear translocation of y-box binding protein 1, to prevent tissue fibrosis in vitro or in mouse models of ssc.   methods human dermal fibroblasts were exposed to hsc025 at various concentrations in the presence of tgfbeta, and levels of collagen or fibronectin expression were determined. hsc025 (15 mg/kg/day for 14 days) was administered orally to tight skin mice and to mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. improvement of tissue fibrosis was evaluated by histologic or biochemical examination in each model.   results pretreatment with hsc025 prevented smad-dependent promoter activation, in a dose-dependent manner; however, hsc025 had no effect on tgfbeta-induced phosphorylation of smad3. the inhibitory effects of hsc025 on tgfbeta-induced collagen or fibronectin expression were also confirmed in vitro. orally administered hsc025 significantly reduced hypodermal thickness and hydroxyproline content in tight skin mice, and markedly decreased the histologic score and hydroxyproline content in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice.   conclusion these results demonstrate that hsc025 is a novel inhibitor of tgfbeta/smad signaling, resulting in the improvement of skin and pulmonary fibrosis. orally available hsc025 might therefore be useful in the treatment of ssc. smads regulate transcription of defined genes in response to tgf-beta receptor activation, although the mechanisms of smad-mediated transcription are not well understood. we demonstrate that the tgf-beta-inducible smad3 uses the tumor suppressor smad4/dpc4 and cbp/p300 as transcriptional coactivators, which associate with smad3 in response to tgf-beta. the association of cbp with smad3 was localized to the carboxyl terminus of smad3, which is required for transcriptional activation, and a defined segment in cbp. furthermore, cbp/p300 stimulated both tgf-beta- and smad-induced transcription in a smad4/dpc4-dependent fashion. smad3 transactivation and tgf-beta-induced transcription were inhibited by expressing e1a, which interferes with cbp functions. the coactivator functions and physical interactions of smad4 and cbp/p300 with smad3 allow a model for the induction of gene expression in response to tgf-beta.
raffinose synthase 5 (atrs5, at5g40390) was characterized from arabidopsis as a recombinant enzyme. it has a far higher affinity for the substrates galactinol and sucrose than any other raffinose synthase previously reported. in addition raffinose synthase 5 is also working as a galactosylhydrolase, degrading galactinol, and raffinose under certain conditions. together with raffinose synthase 4, which is predominantly a stachyose synthase, both enzymes contribute to the raffinose family oligosaccharide (rfo) accumulation in seeds. a double knockout in raffinose synthase 4 and raffinose synthase 5 (δatrs4,5) was generated, which is devoid of rfos in seeds. unstressed leaves of 4 week old δatrs4,5 plants showed drastically 23.8-fold increased concentrations of galactinol. unexpectedly, raffinose appeared again in drought stressed δatrs4,5 plants, but not under other abiotic stress conditions. drought stress leads to novel transcripts of raffinose synthase 6 suggesting that this isoform is a further stress inducible raffinose synthase in arabidopsis. δatrs4,5 seeds showed a 5 days delayed germination phenotype in darkness and an elevated expression of the transcription factor phytochrome interacting factor 1 (atpif1) target gene atpif6, being a repressor of germination. this prolonged dormancy is not seen during germination in the light. exogenous galactose partially promotes germination of δatrs4,5 seeds in the dark suggesting that rfos act as a galactose store and repress atpif6 transcripts. phytochrome interacting factor 3-like5 (pil5) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that inhibits seed germination by regulating the expression of gibberellin (ga)- and abscisic acid (aba)-related genes either directly or indirectly. it is not yet known, however, whether pil5 regulates seed germination solely through ga and aba. here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation-chip (chip-chip) analysis to identify 748 novel pil5 binding sites in the arabidopsis thaliana genome. consistent with the molecular function of pil5 as a transcription regulator, most of the identified binding sites are located in gene promoter regions. binding site analysis shows that pil5 binds to its target sites mainly through the g-box motif in vivo. microarray analysis reveals that phytochromes regulate a large number of genes mainly through pil5 during seed germination. comparison between the chip-chip and microarray data indicates that pil5 regulates 166 genes by directly binding to their promoters. many of the identified genes encode transcription regulators involved in hormone signaling, while some encode enzymes involved in cell wall modification. interestingly, pil5 directly regulates many transcription regulators of hormone signaling and indirectly regulates many genes involved in hormone metabolism. taken together, our data indicate that pil5 inhibits seed germination not just through ga and aba, but also by coordinating hormone signals and modulating cell wall properties in imbibed seeds.
abstract cardiovascular function depends on patent, continuous and stable blood vessel formation by endothelial cells (ecs). blood vessel development initiates by vasculogenesis, as ecs coalesce into linear aggregates and organize to form central lumens that allow blood flow. molecular mechanisms underlying in vivo vascular ‘tubulogenesis’ are only beginning to be unraveled. we previously showed that the gtpase-interacting protein called rasip1 is required for the formation of continuous vascular lumens in the early embryo. rasip1−/− ecs exhibit loss of proper cell polarity and cell shape, disrupted localization of ec–ec junctions and defects in adhesion of ecs to extracellular matrix. in vitro studies showed that rasip1 depletion in cultured ecs blocked tubulogenesis. whether rasip1 is required in blood vessels after their initial formation remained unclear. here, we show that rasip1 is essential for vessel formation and maintenance in the embryo, but not in quiescent adult vessels. rasip1 is also required for angiogenesis in three models of blood vessel growth: in vitro matrix invasion, retinal blood vessel growth and directed in vivo angiogenesis assays. rasip1 is thus necessary in growing embryonic blood vessels, postnatal angiogenic sprouting and remodeling, but is dispensable for maintenance of established blood vessels, making it a potential anti-angiogenic therapeutic target. graphical abstract ras proteins are small gtpases that regulate cellular growth and differentiation. components of the ras signaling pathway have been shown to be important during embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. here, we report that rasip1, which encodes a novel ras-interacting protein, is strongly expressed in vascular endothelial cells throughout development, in both mouse and frog. similar to the well-characterized vascular markers vegfr2 and pecam, rasip1 is specifically expressed in angioblasts prior to vessel formation, in the initial embryonic vascular plexus, in the growing blood vessels during angiogenesis and in the endothelium of mature blood vessels into the postnatal period. rasip1 expression is undetectable in vegfr2 null embryos, which lack endothelial cells, suggesting that rasip1 is endothelial specific. sirna-mediated reduction of rasip1 severely impairs angiogenesis and motility in endothelial cell cultures, and morpholino knockdown experiments in frog embryos demonstrate that rasip1 is required for embryonic vessel formation in vivo. together, these data identify rasip1 as a novel endothelial factor that plays an essential role in vascular development.
real-time three-dimensional (rt3d) echocardiography is a new image acquisition technique that allows instantaneous acquisition of volumetric images for quantitative assessment of cardiac morphology and function. to quantify many important diagnostic parameters, such as ventricular volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output, an automatic algorithm to delineate the left ventricle (lv) from rt3d echocardiographic images is essential. while a number of efforts have been made towards segmentation of the lv endocardial (endo) boundaries, the segmentation of epicardial (epi) boundaries remains problematic. in this paper, we present a coupled deformable model that addresses this problem. the idea behind our method is that the volume of the myocardium is close to being constant during a cardiac cycle and our model uses this coupling as an important constraint. we employ two surfaces, each driven by the image-derived information that takes into account ultrasound physics by modeling the speckle statistics using the nakagami distribution while maintaining the coupling. by simultaneously evolving two surfaces, the final segmentation of the myocardium is thus achieved. results from 80 sets of synthetic data and 286 sets of real canine data were evaluated against the ground truth and against outlines from three independent observers, respectively. we show that results obtained with our incompressibility constraint were more accurate than those obtained without constraint or with a wall thickness constraint, and were comparable to those from manual segmentation. this study investigated the use of artificial neural networks (ann) for image segmentation and spatial temporal contour linking for the detection of endocardial contours on echocardiographic images. using a backpropagation network, the system was trained with 279 sample regions obtained from eight training images to segment images into either tissue or blood pool region. the ann system was then applied to parasternal short axis images of 38 patients. spatial temporal contour linking was performed on the segmented images to extract endocardial boarders. left ventricular areas (end-systolic and end-diastolic) determined with the automated system were calculated and compared to results obtained by manual contour tracing performed by two independent investigators. in addition, ejection fractions (ef) were derived using the area-length method and compared with radionuclide ventriculography. image quality was classified as good in 12 (32%), moderate in 13 (34%) and poor in 13 (34%) patients. the ann system provided estimates of end-diastolic and end-systolic areas in 36 (89%) of echocardiograms, which correlated well with those obtained by manual tracing (r = 0.99, see = 1.44). a good agreement was also found for the comparison of ef between the ann system and tc-radionuclide ventriculography (rnv, r = 0.93, see = 6.36). the ann system also performed well in the subset of patients with poor image quality. endocardial contour detection using artificial neural networks and spatial temporal contour linking allows accurate calculations of ventricular areas from transthoracic echocardiograms and performs well even in images with poor quality. this system could greatly enhance the feasibility, accuracy and reproducibility of calculating cardiac areas to derive left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions.
this study investigated the importance of binocular vision to foot placement accuracy when stepping onto a floor-based target during gait initiation. starting from stationary, participants placed alternate feet onto targets sequentially positioned along a straight travel path with the added constraint that the initial target (target 1) could move in the medio-lateral (m-l) direction. repeated trials when target 1 remained stationary or moved laterally at the instant of lead-limb toe-off (to) or 200 ms after to (early swing) were undertaken under binocular and monocular viewing. catch trials when target 1 shifted medially were also undertaken. foot-reach kinematics, foot trajectory corrections and foot placement accuracy for the step onto target 1 were determined via 3d motion analyses. peak foot-reach velocity and initial foot-reach duration were unaffected by vision condition but terminal foot-reach duration was prolonged under monocular conditions (p = 0.002). foot trajectory alteration onsets were unaffected by vision condition, but onsets occurred sooner when the target shifted in early swing compared to at to (p = 0.033). m-l foot placement accuracy decreased (p = 0.025) and variability increased (p = 0.05) under monocular conditions, particularly when stepping onto the moving target. there was no difference between vision conditions in a-p foot placement accuracy. results indicate that monocular vision provides sufficient information to determine stepping distance and correctly transport the foot towards the target but binocular vision is required to attain a precise m-l foot placement; particularly so when stepping onto a moving target. these findings are in agreement with those found in the reaching and grasping literature, indicating that binocular vision is important for end-point precision. in comparison to lateral judgments of distance, stereoscopic judgments are not precise. although stereoacuity thresholds for targets presented in the fixation plane can equal the best thresholds for the monocular hyperacuities, i.e. a few sec arc, the increment thresholds for disparity are substantially larger than the increment thresholds for lateral separation (width). we measured the minimum detectable change in the three-dimensional distance separating two features, one presented in the fixation plane, and the other some distance in front of it, i.e. with a significant standing disparity between the two features. for briefly-presented targets (150 msec), the weber fraction for disparity was 10-20% over the range from 1 to 20 min arc, while the weber fraction for width was only 2-3% under comparable conditions. the disparity thresholds were substantially improved for a longer duration target (1000 msec), but they were still a factor of two worse than the monocular width thresholds. in a related experiment, the vernier acuity for a standard vernier target was profoundly degraded by pairing the offset upper line presented to one eye with a disparate line in the other eye; the vernier threshold was elevated for disparities ranging from 3 to 30 min arc. this finding shows that the more precise monocular signals are actively suppressed in fused or partially-fused stereoscopic images.
objectiveslimited data exist about the risk factors of melanoma in the greek population. we investigated the association of melanoma with phenotypic and solar indices in this darker skin population residing in an environment of high ambient ultraviolet radiation.methodsour study included 200 sporadic melanoma cases and 200 age-, sex-matched control subjects. information on history of sun exposure patterns and cutaneous reaction to sunlight was obtained and a clinical evaluation of pigmentary traits, pigmented lesions, and actinic keratoses was performed.resultsin the multivariate analysis, fair skin (or: 4.63, for fair skin versus light brown, 95% ci: 1.54–13.92), intermittent sun exposure during childhood (or: 3.33, >2 weeks/year of sun exposure versus ≤2 weeks/year 95% ci: 1.37–8.09), and outdoor leisure activities (or: 2.74, 95% ci: 1.28–5.89), but not skin phototype or sunburns, were positively related to the risk of melanoma. in addition to an elevated count of common melanocytic nevi (or: 6.27, ≥10 nevi versus no nevi, 95% ci: 1.65–23.76) and the presence of clinically atypical nevi (or: 2.84, 95% ci: 1.16–6.98), solar lentigenes were an independent risk factor of melanoma (or: 4.33, 95% ci: 1.67–11.22).conclusionsintermittent sun exposure of moderate intensity during childhood/adolescence and outdoor leisural activities, in conjunction with a more resistant skin phenotype to acute sunburns and a strong association with nevi and solar lentigenes was a prominent determinant of melanoma risk in our population. different pigmentary characteristics as well as different parameters of sun exposure have previously been identified as risk factors for developing cutaneous melanoma. the aim of the present study was to identify significant risk factors, determine the related magnitude of their estimated relative risks, and define criteria for the detection of persons at risk. five hundred thirteen melanoma patients and 498 controls matched for age and sex underwent a whole-body examination for the number and type of melanocytic lesions and were interviewed on ultraviolet exposure and other potential risk factors. the total number of common melanocytic nevi on all body sites represented the most important risk factor in multiple logistic regression analysis with a relative risk of 7.6 for subjects with more than 100 versus no more than 10 melanocytic nevi. other significant independent risk factors were the number of atypical melanocytic nevi (relative risk, 6.1 for at least 5 melanocytic nevi versus none), the number of actinic lentigines (relative risk, 3.5 for many versus none), hair color, skin type, and reported melanocytic nevus growth. no single parameter of sun exposure was significantly related to melanoma risk in the multivariate analysis. groups with an estimated relative risk between 1 and 121.0 were distinguished by considering common and atypical melanocytic nevi as well as actinic lentigines as the decisive criteria. in conclusion, even without any information on the case history, whole-body examination and diagnosis of pigmented lesions was found to be an effective strategy for identifying persons at risk of developing melanoma. furthermore, clinical recognition of at least 5 atypical melanocytic nevi without histologic examination is a key for identifying subjects at high risk.
alternative splicing at the mapt gene exon 10 yields similar levels of the 3r and 4r tau protein isoforms.1 the presence of mutations, particularly in exon 10 and intron 10–11, changes the quantity of tau isoforms. domination each of the isoform yields tau protein aggregation and frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (ftdp-17). here, we report for the first time the secondary structure of the 194/195 nucleotide region for the wild type (wt) and 10 mutants of the mapt gene pre-mrna determined using both chemical and microarray mapping. thermodynamic analyses indicate that single nucleotide mutations in the splicing regulatory element (sre) that form a hairpin affect its stability by up to 4 and 7 kcal/mol. moreover, binding the regulatory hairpin of small molecule ligands (neomycin, kanamycin, tobramycin and mitoxantrone) enhance its stability depending on the nature of the ligands and the rna mutations. experiments using the cos-7 cell line indicate that the presence of ligands and modified antisense oligonucleotides affect the quantity of 3r and 4r isoforms. this finding correlates with the thermodynamic stability of the regulatory hairpin. an alternative splicing regulation mechanism for exon 10 is postulated based on our experimental data and on published data. we have determined the sequences of isoforms of human tau protein, which differ from previously reported forms by insertions of 29 or 58 amino acids in the amino-terminal region. complementary dna cloning shows that the insertions occur in combination with both three and four tandem repeats. rnaase protection assays indicate that transcripts encoding isoforms with the insertions are expressed in an adult-specific manner. transcripts encoding four tandem repeats are also expressed in an adult-specific manner, whereas mrnas encoding three tandem repeats are expressed throughout life, including in fetal brain. the levels of transcripts encoding the 29 or 58 amino acid inserts were not significantly changed in cerebral cortex from patients with alzheimer's disease. antisera raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to these different human tau isoforms demonstrate that multiple tau protein isoforms are incorporated into the neurofibrillary tangles of alzheimer's disease.
abstract ras-related, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins of the ypt/rab family play a key role at defined steps in vesicular transport, both in yeast and in mammalian cells. in yeast, ypt1p has an essential function late in endoplasmic reticulum (er) to golgi transport, and the redundant ypt31/ypt32 gtpases have been proposed to act in transport through and/or from the golgi. here we report that mutant alleles of ypt31 and ypt32, whose gene products have a reduced affinity for gtp, are able to suppress the dominant lethal phenotype of ypt1n121i. co-expression of ypt1n121i and the suppressor ypt31n126i allow essentially undisturbed secretory transport in the absence of the respective wild-type gtpases. such mutant cells massively overaccumulate 60–100 nm vesicles and are heat sensitive. it appears likely that the mutant gtpases, which are defective in nucleotide binding, compete for the binding of common interacting protein(s). these and other genetic interactions between ypt1, ypt31/32, arf1 and sec4 described here strongly support the view that ypt31p and ypt32p have a central, golgi-associated function in anterograde or retrograde transport. the ypt2 gene of the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe encodes a member of the ypt/rab family of small gtp-binding proteins, related in sequence to sec4p of saccharomyces cerevisiae but closer to mammalian rab8. we have introduced a mutation into the gene corresponding to a mutation identified in ypt1, in which a conserved valine residue was altered to asparagine. the mutated ypt2 gene was introduced into the s. pombe genome by gene replacement. the resulting strain was temperature-sensitive for growth. normal growth was restored by introduction of a plasmid-borne wild-type ypt2 cdna or by cdna for rab8 but not by various other rab or ypt sequences. at restrictive temperature the mutant cells accumulated the secretory protein acid phosphatase in a form that appeared to be fully glycosylated and acquired a population of vesicles detectable by electron microscopy. thus the ypt2 protein, and by inference rab8, appear to function in the last stage of the secretory pathway.
this paper contains both a review of recent approaches to supersymmetric lattice field theories and some new results on the deconstruction approach. the essential reason for the complex phase problem of the fermion determinant is shown to be derivative interactions that are not present in the continuum. these irrelevant operators violate the self-conjugacy of the fermion action that is present in the continuum. it is explained why this complex phase problem does not disappear in the continuum limit. the fermion determinant suppression of various branches of the classical moduli space is explored, and found to be supportive of previous claims regarding the continuum limit. we present preliminary numerical results from a lattice study of the two-dimensional o(3) non-linear sigma model. in the continuum this model possesses n =2 supersymmetry. the lattice formulation we use retains an exact (twisted) supersymmetry except for a soft breaking associated with a wilson mass term needed to remove the doubles. our numerical results show that the partition function is independent of coupling as predicted by supersymmetry.
programmed death‐1 (pd‐1)/b7‐h1 costimulation acts as a negative regulator of host alloimmune responses. although cd4 t cells mediate innate immunity‐dominated ischemia and reperfusion injury (iri) in the liver, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. this study focused on the role of pd‐1/b7‐h1 negative signaling in liver iri. we used an established mouse model of partial liver warm ischemia (90 minutes) followed by reperfusion (6 hours). although disruption of pd‐1 signaling after anti–b7‐h1 monoclonal antibody treatment augmented hepatocellular damage, its stimulation following b7‐h1 immunoglobulin (b7‐h1ig) fusion protected livers from iri, as evidenced by low serum alanine aminotransferase levels and well‐preserved liver architecture. the therapeutic potential of b7‐h1 engagement was evident by diminished intrahepatic t lymphocyte, neutrophil, and macrophage infiltration/activation; reduced cell necrosis/apoptosis but enhanced anti‐necrotic/apoptotic bcl‐2/bcl‐xl; and decreased proinflammatory chemokine/cytokine gene expression in parallel with selectively increased interleukin (il)‐10. neutralization of il‐10 re‐created liver iri and rendered b7‐h1ig–treated hosts susceptible to iri. these findings were confirmed in t cell–macrophage in vitro coculture in which b7‐h1ig diminished tumor necrosis factor‐α/il‐6 levels in an il‐10–dependent manner. our novel findings document the essential role of the pd‐1/b7‐h1 pathway in liver iri. conclusion: this study is the first to demonstrate that stimulating pd‐1 signals ameliorated liver iri by inhibiting t cell activation and kupffer cell/macrophage function. harnessing mechanisms of negative costimulation by pd‐1 upon t cell–kupffer cell cross‐talk may be instrumental in the maintenance of hepatic homeostasis by minimizing organ damage and promoting il‐10–dependent cytoprotection. (hepatology 2010.) the proto-oncogene bcl-2 and a bcl-2-related gene bcl-x prevent apoptotic cell death induced by various treatments. although a mechanism has been proposed that involves bcl-2 activity on reactive oxygen species (ros), we find that expression of bcl-2 or bcl-xl prevents cell death induced by withdrawal of oxygen (hypoxia) and that the cell death does not involve ros, suggesting that bcl-2 or bcl-xl exerts an anti-cell death function by a mechanism other than through regulation of ros activity. using electron microscopy, and confocal and non-confocal fluorescence microscopy, we show that hypoxia induces both necrosis and apoptosis. overexpression of bcl-2 or bcl-xl blocks hypoxia-induced apoptosis and, although to a lesser extent, necrosis. the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-2 and bcl-xl effectively inhibit kcn-induced cell death which is characterized by necrotic features including apparently intact chromatin, remarkable mitochondrial swelling with loss of crista structure and loss of plasma membrane integrity. the necrotic cell death is also inhibited by inhibitors of ice (interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme)(-like) proteases, the common mediators of apoptosis. these results indicate that bcl-2/bcl-xl and ice(-like) proteases modulate both apoptotic and at least some forms of necrotic cell death, suggesting that both cell death pathways involve some common mediators.
plants recognize potential microbial pathogens through microbial-associated molecular patterns (mamps) and activate a series of defense responses, including cell death and the production of reactive oxygen species (ros) and diverse anti-microbial secondary metabolites. mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) cascades are known to play a pivotal role in mediating mamp signals; however, the signaling pathway from a mapk cascade to the activation of defense responses is poorly understood. here, we found in rice that the chitin elicitor, a fungal mamp, activates two rice mapks (osmpk3 and osmpk6) and one mapk kinase (osmkk4). osmpk6 was essential for the chitin elicitor-induced biosynthesis of diterpenoid phytoalexins. conditional expression of the active form of osmkk4 (osmkk4dd) induced extensive alterations in gene expression, which implied dynamic changes of metabolic flow from glycolysis to secondary metabolite biosynthesis while suppressing basic cellular activities such as translation and cell division. osmkk4dd also induced various defense responses, such as cell death, biosynthesis of diterpenoid phytoalexins and lignin but not generation of extracellular ros. osmkk4dd-induced cell death and expression of diterpenoid phytoalexin pathway genes, but not that of phenylpropanoid pathway genes, were dependent on osmpk6. collectively, the osmkk4–osmpk6 cascade plays a crucial role in reprogramming plant metabolism during mamp-triggered defense responses. arabidopsis map kinase 4 (mpk4) functions as a regulator of pathogen defense responses, because it is required for both repression of salicylic acid (sa)‐dependent resistance and for activation of jasmonate (ja)‐dependent defense gene expression. to understand mpk4 signaling mechanisms, we used yeast two‐hybrid screening to identify the mpk4 substrate mks1. analyses of transgenic plants and genome‐wide transcript profiling indicated that mks1 is required for full sa‐dependent resistance in mpk4 mutants, and that overexpression of mks1 in wild‐type plants is sufficient to activate sa‐dependent resistance, but does not interfere with induction of a defense gene by ja. further yeast two‐hybrid screening revealed that mks1 interacts with the wrky transcription factors wrky25 and wrky33. wrky25 and wrky33 were shown to be in vitro substrates of mpk4, and a wrky33 knockout mutant was found to exhibit increased expression of the sa‐related defense gene pr1. mks1 may therefore contribute to mpk4‐regulated defense activation by coupling the kinase to specific wrky transcription factors.
the plateau pika (ochotona curzonia) has adapted to high-altitude hypoxia during evolution. higher microvessel density in specific tissues and a blunted hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction response are the critical components of this adaptation. vegf, vascular endothelial growth factor, has proved to be a key regulator of angiogenesis in response to tissue hypoxia and to play an important role in vascular vasodilation. however, the role of vegf in adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in the plateau pika remains unknown. in this study, we cloned cdnas for vegf165 and vegf189 and examined their expression in pikas inhabiting altitudes of 3200 and 4750 m. phylogenetic analysis reveals that pika vegf165 and vegf189 are evolutionarily conserved. real-time pcr analysis demonstrates that vegf165 and vegf189 display tissue and altitude-specific expression patterns. interestingly, we found that the levels of vegf189 mrna are significantly higher than those of vegf165 in the brain and muscle tissues of the pika, which is different from what was previously observed in sea-level mammals. vegf189 mrna levels in brain, muscle, and lung of the pika increased with increased habitat altitude, whereas vegf165 shows less change. our study suggests an important role for vegf189 in adaptation to hypoxia by the plateau pika in the high-altitude environment. lung development and repair of hyperoxic injury require closely regulated growth and regeneration of alveolar capillaries. vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), a mitogen for endothelial cells, is expressed by alveolar epithelial cells. alternative splicing of vegf mrna results in isoforms of varying mitogenicity and solubility. we examined changes in the proportions of the vegf splice variant mrnas in rabbit lung development and in control, oxygen-injured, and recovering newborn and adult rabbit lungs. the proportion of the 189-amino acid vegf mrna, which codes for an isoform that binds to the extracellular matrix, increased fivefold during development (from 8% of total vegf message at 22 days gestation to 40% in 10-day newborn lungs; p < 0.001). during neonatal oxygen injury, its expression declined from 38 to 8% of vegf message (p < 0.002) and returned to the control value in recovery. a similar pattern was observed in adults. vegf protein in lung lavage fluid increased slightly during hyperoxia, declined to barely detectable levels at the 50% lethal dose time point, and increased 10-fold (newborn) or up to 40-fold (adult) in recovering animals. we conclude that alternative splicing may have important roles in the regulation of vegf activity in developing and injured lungs.
background co-infection with falciparum malaria and hiv-1 increases the severity and mortality of both infections in unstable malaria-transmission areas. in contrast, in stable transmission areas, hiv co-infection increases the severity of both infections but has not been found to influence malaria mortality. methods in a prospective cross-sectional study, clinical and laboratory data were consecutively collected for all adults admitted with fever and/or suspected malaria to the medical department of the central hospital of maputo, mozambique, during two malaria seasons from january 2011. malaria and hiv pcrs were performed, and risk factors for fatal outcomes were analysed. the impact of hiv on the clinical presentation and mortality of malaria was assessed. findings a total of 212 non-pregnant adults with fever and/or suspected malaria and 56 healthy controls were included in the study. of the 131 patients with confirmed falciparum malaria, 70 were co-infected with hiv-1. the in-hospital mortality of the co-infected patients was 13.0% (9/69) compared with 1.7% (1/59) in the patients without hiv (p = 0.018). malaria severity (p = 0.016) and co-infection with hiv (p = 0.064) were independent risk factors for death although the association with hiv did not reach statistical significance. the co-infected patients had significantly more frequent respiratory distress, bleeding disturbances, hypoglycaemia, liver and renal failure and high malaria parasitemia compared with the patients with malaria alone. interpretations hiv co-infection is associated with increased disease severity in and mortality from malaria in an area of stable malaria transmission. this finding was not observed earlier and should motivate doctors working in malaria-endemic areas to consider early hiv testing and a closer follow-up of patients with malaria and hiv co-infection. background malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-saharan africa.   objective the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of malaria among long distance truck drivers in the niger delta of nigeria.   methods a total of one hundred consecutively recruited long distance truck drivers aged 21-60 years, with a mean age of 42.36 ± 5.23 years were screened for the presence of malaria parasitaemia.   results out of the 100 truck drivers screened, 35 (35%) were positive for malaria while 65 (65%) were negative. plasmodium falciparum was responsible for all cases of malaria infection. the highest prevalence of malaria occurred among drivers in the 51-60 years age group (40.5%). the mean and standard deviation (sd) of parasite load was 1 020 (125) parasites/ìl in subjects positive for malaria. the mean cd4 count was significantly higher among non-parasitized truck drivers compared to p. falciparum parasitized drivers 820 ± 42.0 (731-902 cells/ µl) and 570 ± 30.0 (510-630 cells/ µl) respectively (chi square = 74.00; p = 0.03). we observed a significant negative correlation between plasmodial infection and cd4 lymphocyte count among plasmodium falciparum-infected subjects with r = - 0.56 (p= 0.001).   conclusion preventative strategies including regular chemoprophylaxis, intermittent preventive treatment with antimalarials and provision of insecticide-treated bed nets should be implemented.
we report a case of papillary carcinoma (pc) with extensive squamous metaplasia arising from a thyroglossal duct cyst (tdc) that required differential diagnosis from squamous cell carcinoma (scc). an 11-year-old japanese girl presented with a 9-month history of an anterior-midline neck mass that was clinically diagnosed as tdc. open neck biopsy revealed nested proliferation of atypical squamous cells within the cystic structures, and scc arising from tdc was initially suspected. further examination, however, including immunohistochemistry, revealed the tumor to be of thyroid cell origin. the patient underwent wide local resection of the thyroglossal duct carcinoma by sistrunk procedure and cervical lymph node dissection. microscopically, the diagnosis was of pc with extensive squamous metaplasia and metastasis to the medial submandibular lymph node. distinction of squamous metaplasia in pc from scc is sometimes difficult, but has a significant effect on postoperative management. carcinoma within the thyroglossal duct (tgdca) is a very rare pediatric tumor. this report presents the case of a 15-year-old girl with tgdca, reviews the previously published pediatric cases of this tumor, and provides diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in tgdca in children. twenty one cases of tgdca have been reported, 12 of them in females. mean age at presentation was approximately 13 years for females and approximately 12 years for males. the duration of a midcervical mass prior to the diagnosis of tgdca varied from 3 weeks to 8 years. the size of the neck mass at presentation averaged 2 cm-4 cm. all masses were asymptomatic, and the diagnosis of tgdca was incidental following surgery. all pediatric cases of tgdca reported thus far were of the papillary type, except for 3 patients who presented with a mixed papillary-follicular carcinoma. capsular invasion was detected in 10 (45%) patients. local invasive disease was found in 5 (23%) patients, but all removed thyroid glands (12) were free of carcinoma. one patient had lung metastases. thyroidectomy with subsequent radioiodine ablation was the treatment of choice in the majority of the cases. the reported prognosis for tgdca in children was favorable, with only one reported death.
benzene is an established hematotoxic carcinogen which can cause leukemia. dna damage and disorder of repair capacity are the crucial mechanisms in leukemogenesis of benzene. dna methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza) and histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin a (tsa) are two kinds of key epigenetic modification reagents. the mrna expression of poly(adp-ribose) polymerases-1 (parp-1), a pivotal repair gene, has been decreased by benzene. however, the effect of epigenetic modification on benzene-induced low parp-1 expression has not been reported. in this study, lymphoblastoid cell line f32 was incubated by benzene and then further treated with 5-aza and tsa, alone or in combination. the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and methylation-specific pcr were performed to examine the mrna expression and methylation status of parp-1, respectively. results showed a dramatic decrease of parp-1 mrna expression and a simultaneously obvious increase in the level of parp-1 methylation in benzene-treated cells compared to the control. further, the parp-1 mrna expression was restored and the level of parp-1 methylation was also reduced following epigenetic inhibitors, 5-aza and tsa, alone or in combination treatments. taken together, methylation of parp-1 promoter might be involved in the regulation of benzene-induced decrease of parp-1 mrna expression. exposure to benzene is generally accepted as a cause of acute myeloid leukemia (aml), but the association with other cell types of leukemia and other lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers is controversial. we compiled epidemiologic research on benzene and lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers in order to assess the pattern of associations. eighteen relevant community-based and 16 industry-based studies were located. four of seven studies of lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer in the aggregate identified relative risks of 1.8 or more, and eight of 14 total leukemia studies yielded relative risks in that range. the few available studies of specific histologic types of leukemia do not indicate larger or more consistent elevations in risk for aml compared to other leukemia cell types. sporadic reports have linked benzene to non-hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma, but most studies do not indicate a positive association. limitations in study quality, particularly exposure assessment, pervade all of the studies reviewed, and the distinction between studies addressing benzene and those addressing jobs in industries that use benzene is somewhat arbitrary. nonetheless, the epidemiologic evidence linking benzene to leukemia in the aggregate, as well as for subtypes other than aml, is no less persuasive than that for aml alone.
key messagea new stem rust resistance genesr49was mapped to chromosome 5bl of wheat. usefulness of the closely linked markerssun209andsun479for marker-assisted selection ofsr49was demonstrated.abstractlandrace aus28011 (mahmoudi), collected from ghardimaou, tunisia, produced low stem rust response against australian pathotypes of puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (pgt) carrying virulence for several stem rust resistance genes deployed in modern wheat cultivars. genetic analysis based on a mahmoudi/yitpi f3 population indicated the involvement of a single all-stage stem rust resistance gene and it was temporarily named srm. bulked segregant analysis using multiplex-ready ssr technology located srm on the long arm of chromosome 5b. since there is no other all-stage stem rust resistance gene located in chromosome 5bl, srm was permanently designated sr49. the mahmoudi/yitpi f3 population was enhanced to generate f6 recombinant inbred line (ril) population for detailed mapping of sr49 using publicly available genomic resources. markers sun209 and sun479 flanked sr49 at 1.5 and 0.9 cm distally and proximally, respectively. markers sun209 and sun479 amplified pcr products different than the sr49-linked alleles in 146 and 145 common wheat cultivars, respectively. six and seven cultivars, respectively, carried the resistance-linked marker alleles sun209148bp and sun479200bp; however, none of the cultivars carried both resistance-linked alleles. these results demonstrated the usefulness of these markers for marker-assisted selection of sr49 in breeding programs. key messagewe have demonstrated that genomic selection in diverse wheat landraces for resistance to leaf, stem and strip rust is possible, as genomic breeding values were moderately accurate. markers with large effects in the bayesian analysis confirmed many known genes, while also discovering many previously uncharacterised genome regions associated with rust scores.abstractgenomic selection, where selection decisions are based on genomic estimated breeding values (gebvs) derived from genome-wide dna markers, could accelerate genetic progress in plant breeding. in this study, we assessed the accuracy of gebvs for rust resistance in 206 hexaploid wheat (triticum aestivum) landraces from the watkins collection of phenotypically diverse wheat genotypes from 32 countries. the landraces were genotyped for 5,568 snps using an illumina iselect 9 k bead chip assay and phenotyped for field-based leaf rust (lr), stem rust (sr) and stripe rust (yr) responses across multiple years. genomic best linear unbiased prediction (gblup) and a bayesian regression method (bayesr) were used to predict gebvs. based on fivefold cross-validation, the accuracy of genomic prediction averaged across years was 0.35, 0.27 and 0.44 for lr, sr and yr using gblup and 0.33, 0.38 and 0.30 for lr, sr and yr using bayesr, respectively. inclusion of pcr-predicted genotypes for known rust resistance genes increased accuracy more substantially when the marker was diagnostic (lr34/sr57/yr18) for the presence-absence of the gene rather than just linked (sr2). investigation of the impact of genetic relatedness between validation and reference lines on accuracy of genomic prediction showed that accuracy will be higher when each validation line had at least one close relationship to the reference lines. overall, the prediction accuracies achieved in this study are encouraging, and confirm the feasibility of genomic selection in wheat. in several instances, estimated marker effects were confirmed by published literature and results of mapping experiments using watkins accessions.
peripheral insulin resistance is the failure of proper cellular glucose uptake in response to insulin. insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are associated with several disease states in the horse and reproductive function disturbances in humans, including polycystic ovarian syndrome. to test the hypothesis that insulin resistance (ir) and hyperinsulinemia disrupt the estrous cycle in mares, two experiments were conducted to first develop a model to induce ir and to then examine the effect of this model on the duration of the estrous cycle. in exp. 1, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (hec) procedure was performed on seven mares to determine insulin sensitivity before and immediately following infusion of a heparinized lipid solution. the hec procedure was repeated 1 wk after lipid infusion. mares developed ir following the lipid infusion (p < 0.05), and some individuals maintained ir for up to 1 wk. mares also exhibited increased blood insulin both immediately following treatment and 1 wk later (p < 0.05). in exp. 2, induction of insulin resistance by lipid solution was not accompanied by changes in circulating concentrations of luteinizing hormone, and duration of the luteal phase, compared with the duration of untreated luteal phases. nonetheless, lipid infusion and the resultant insulin resistance were associated with an increased interovulatory period (p < 0.05), and peak concentrations of progesterone (p < 0.05) were higher during the treated vs. untreated luteal phases of the estrous cycle. the results from the preliminary study suggest that infusion of a lipid solution may induce transient insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. the resulting insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia may modify characteristics of the estrous cycle, perhaps at the level of the ovary. to examine whether and how intramyocellular lipid (imcl) content contributes to interindividual variation in insulin action, we studied 20 healthy men with no family history of type 2 diabetes. imcl was measured as the resonance of intramyocellular ch(2) protons in lipids/resonance of ch(3) protons of total creatine (imcl/cr(t)), using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in vastus lateralis muscle. whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured using a 120-min euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (insulin infusion rate 40 mu/m(2). min) clamp. muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle were taken before and 30 min after initiation of the insulin infusion to assess insulin signaling. the subjects were divided into groups with high imcl (hiimcl; 9.5 +/- 0.9 imcl/cr(t), n = 10) and low imcl (loimcl; 3.0 +/- 0.5 imcl/cr(t), n = 10), the cut point being median imcl (6.1 imcl/cr(t)). the groups were comparable with respect to age (43 +/- 3 vs. 40 +/- 3 years, ns, hiimcl versus loimcl), bmi (26 +/- 1 vs. 26 +/- 1 kg/m(2), ns), and maximal oxygen consumption (33 +/- 2 vs. 36 +/- 3 ml. kg(-1). min(-1), ns). whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was lower in the hiimcl group (3.0 +/- 0.4 mg. kg(-1). min(-1)) than the loimcl group (5.1 +/- 0.5 mg. kg(-1). min(-1), p < 0.05). serum free fatty acid concentrations were comparable basally, but during hyperinsulinemia, they were 35% higher in the hiimcl group than the loimcl group (p < 0.01). study of insulin signaling indicated that insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (ir) was blunted in hiimcl compared with loimcl (57 vs. 142% above basal, p < 0.05), while protein expression of the ir was unaltered. ir substrate-1-associated phosphatidylinositol (pi) 3-kinase activation by insulin was also lower in the hiimcl group than in the loimcl group (49 +/- 23 vs. 84 +/- 27% above basal, p < 0.05 between hiimcl and loimcl). in conclusion, imcl accumulation is associated with whole-body insulin resistance and with defective insulin signaling in skeletal muscle independent of body weight and physical fitness.
background people with schizophrenia demonstrate perceptual organization impairments, and these are thought to contribute to their face processing difficulties.   method we examined the neural substrates of emotionally neutral face processing in schizophrenia by investigating neural activity under three stimulus conditions: faces characterized by the full spectrum of spatial frequencies, faces with low spatial frequency information removed [high spatial frequency (hsf) condition], and faces with high spatial frequency information removed [low spatial frequency (lsf) condition]. face perception in the hsf condition is more reliant on local feature processing whereas perception in the lsf condition requires greater reliance on global form processing. past studies of perceptual organization in schizophrenia indicate that patients perform relatively more poorly with degraded stimuli but also that, when global information is absent, patients may perform better than controls because of their relatively increased ability to initially process individual features. therefore, we hypothesized that people with schizophrenia (n=14) would demonstrate greater face processing difficulties than controls (n=13) in the lsf condition, whereas they would demonstrate a smaller difference or superior performance in the hsf condition.   results in a gender-discrimination task, behavioral data indicated high levels of accuracy for both groups, with a trend toward an interaction involving higher patient performance in the hsf condition and poorer patient performance in the lsf condition. patients demonstrated greater activity in the fusiform gyrus compared to controls in both degraded conditions.   conclusions these data suggest that impairments in basic integration abilities may be compensated for by relatively increased activity in this region. pathways within the visual system can be distinguished on the basis of selectivity for low or high spatial frequencies. spatial frequency discrimination was evaluated in 17 medicated male patients with schizophrenia and 19 male control subjects. subjects were required to discriminate whether pairs of high contrast, sinusoidally modulated gratings were the same or different in spatial frequency. accuracy performance was compared at high, medium, and low spatial frequencies on tasks matched for control performance. patients showed a greater performance decrement of 12% on low as compared with 4% on high spatial frequencies. these findings suggest a disturbance of right hemisphere mechanisms involved in spatial perception and attention in schizophrenia.
menopause in women occurs at mid-life. chimpanzees, in contrast, continue to display cycles of menstrual bleeding and genital swelling, suggestive of ovulation, until near their maximum life span of about 60 years. because ovulation was not confirmed hormonally, however, the age at which chimpanzees experience menopause has remained uncertain. in the present study, we provide hormonal data from urine samples collected from 30 female chimpanzees, of which 9 were old (>30 years), including 2 above the age of 50 years. eight old chimpanzees showed clear endocrine evidence of ovulation, as well as cycles of genital swelling that correlated closely with measured endocrine changes. endocrine evidence thus confirms prior observations (cyclic anogenital swelling) that menopause is a late-life event in the chimpanzee. we also unexpectedly discovered an idiopathic anovulation in some young and middle-aged chimpanzees; this merits further study. because our results on old chimpanzees validate the use of anogenital swelling as a surrogate index of ovulation, we were able to combine data on swelling and urinary hormones to provide the first estimates of age-specific rates of menopause in chimpanzees. we conclude that menopause occurs near 50 years of age in chimpanzees as it does in women. our finding identifies a basic difference between the human and chimpanzee aging processes: female chimpanzees can remain reproductively viable for a greater proportion of their life span than women. thus, while menopause marks the end of the chimpanzee’s life span, women may thrive for decades more. changes in the endocrinology of the pituitary-ovarian axis first become manifest at about the age of 40, a selective rise in serum follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) levels occurring at about the same time as a marked acceleration in the loss of primordial follicles from the ovary. fsh levels gradually increase with increasing age in women who continue to cycle regularly. during the menopausal transition, initiated when changes in cycle frequency or in menstrual flow are first observed, both gonadotrophins, oestradiol and inhibin show a marked degree of variability with abrupt changes from typical post-menopausal patterns to those characteristic of the reproductive age group. within 1-2 years after the final menstrual period or menopause, fsh levels are markedly elevated, luteinizing hormone (lh) levels moderately so, while oestradiol and inhibin levels are low or undetectable. post-menopausally, adrenal androstenedione is the major source of oestrogen and serum testosterone levels fall moderately, with oophorectomy leading to a further significant fall. serum sex hormone binding globulin levels fall to a small degree post-menopausally. areas of persisting controversy include the question of whether oestradiol levels fall with increasing age prior to the onset of the menopausal transition, the relative roles of oestradiol and inhibin in the selective rise of serum fsh and the role of serum androgens post-menopausally.
many guidelines are available for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (lutss) in multiple sclerosis (ms) patients, but no agreement exists on the best approach for subjects without lutss. the objective of this study was to evaluate whether lutss can be detected in ms patients asymptomatic for urinary dysfunction, comparing three different tools [measure of post-void residual volume (prv), bladder diary (bd), a focused questionnaire (ipss)], and whether disability, disease duration and signs of pyramidal involvement are linked to their subclinical presence. 178 ms patients (118 women) have been included (mean age 41.2 years, mean disease duration 11.3 years, mean edss 2.2), and tested with the above-mentioned tools. prv was abnormal in 14 subjects (7.8 %), associated to abnormal findings at ipss in 3 cases, at bd in 2 cases, at both in 1. bd was abnormal in 37 subjects (20.8 %), with concomitant abnormal prv in 2, abnormal ipss in 10 cases, abnormal ipss and bd in 1. ipss was ≥ 9 in 43 subjects (24.1 %). at least one test was abnormal in 76 patients (42.7 %): 1 in 57 patients (32.0 %), 2 in 17 (9.5 %), and 3 tests in 2 (1.1 %). patients with at least one abnormal urinary variable, compared to patients without urinary abnormalities, had a more frequent pyramidal involvement (69.5 vs. 16.8 %, χ2 = 48.6, p < 0.00001), a more frequent occurrence of edss ≥2 (83.1 vs. 23.5 %, χ2 = 56.9, p < 0.00001), and a longer disease duration (15.7 ± 7.3 vs. 9.1 ± 7.1, t = 5.7, p < 0.00001). asymptomatic luts were frequent but none of the tests used permitted to better identify asymptomatic patients. objective to review current management of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (nlutd) in ms patients and give recommendations on the joint role of the neurologist and urologist in nlutd management.   methods an algorithm for evaluation and referral of ms patients to urologists was created. it is an outcome of discussions about current knowledge, existing guidelines, and key issues during two belgian consensus meetings attended by neurologists, urologists and other stakeholders involved in ms management. at these meetings, updated information on management of nlutd in ms was exchanged and the neurologists' opinion on how to integrate this in the other aspects of care in ms patients was explored.   results short evaluation of nlutd in ms patients by neurologists and appropriate referral to urologists could accelerate proper diagnosis and treatment. neurologists can play a central role in the inter-disciplinary communication on interactions between disease manifestations of ms and their treatments.   conclusion the coordinating role of neurologists in nlutd management may considerably improve qol in ms patients. more research is needed to evaluate outcomes of urological assessments and treatment.
the effect of triadimefon (tdm) a triazole compound on antioxidant potential and eugenol content was studied in ocimum tenuiflorum l. the plant was subjected to 15 mg/l tdm by soil-drenching on 50th, 70th and 90th days after planting (dap). analyses were carried out on 60th, 80th and 100th dap. both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant potential estimation was carried out. the non-enzymatic antioxidant viz ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol and reduced glutathione were found to increase under triadimefon treatment. the antioxidant enzyme like superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase and catalase activities showed significant increase in tdm treatment. triazole-treated plants yielded more eugenol (a major component of ocimum-essential oil) in comparison to control. the study evidenced that tdm residues could be detected in the upper soil layer only and does not accumulate in the soil. these preliminary results suggest that tdm may be useful to increase the antioxidant content in medicinal plants and also to act as an elicitor to enhance the production of secondary metabolites of medicinal plants. more than 300 catalase sequences are now available, divided among monofunctional catalases (> 225), bifunctional catalase-peroxidases (> 50) and manganese-containing catalases (> 25). when combined with the recent appearance of crystal structures from at least two representatives from each of these groups (nine from the monofunctional catalases), valuable insights into the catalatic reaction mechanism in its various forms and into catalase evolution have been gained. the structures have revealed an unusually large number of modifications unique to catalases, a result of interacting with reactive oxygen species. biochemical and physiological characterization of catalases from many different organisms has revealed a surprisingly wide range of catalatic efficiencies, despite similar sequences. catalase gene expression in micro-organisms generally is controlled either by sensors of reactive oxygen species or by growth phase regulons, although the detailed mechanisms vary considerably.
a 59-year-old man was admitted because of recurrent, severe hypoglycemia. he had multiple metastases from a meningeal hemangiopericytoma, which had been operated on 12 years earlier. the results of laboratory testing at the time of hypoglycemia showed very low serum levels of insulin, c-peptide, and growth hormone, with slightly high levels of insulin-like growth factor-ii, and a normal level of insulin-like growth factor-i. the diagnosis of hemangiopericytoma-associated hypoglycemia was proposed. the patient was given corticosteroid therapy, which ameliorated symptoms of hypoglycemia. serum insulin-like growth factor ii (igf-ii) was characterized by radioimmunoassay and western immunoblot in 44 patients with non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (nicth). 31 of 44 patients with nicth had big igf-ii in sera. when the presence of igf-ii in tumors from 20 patients was investigated, igf-ii in tumors was detected in 18 patients and these patients had big igf-ii in sera. in two patients whose tumors did not contain igf-ii, big igf-ii in sera was not detected. in six patients with igf-ii in tumors, hypoglycemia disappeared and the big igf-ii decreased after successful removal of the tumors. these data indicate that the big igf-ii could be related to hypoglycemia, and that the increased serum big igf-ii suggests igf-ii-producing nicth. serum igf-ii levels in 31 patients with big igf-ii were greater than those in 13 patients without it (mean +/- sem: 723+/-54 vs. 326+/-31 ng/ml), but the elevated igf-ii levels were found in only 13 patients. serum igf-i levels were low in all patients with nicth. in the 13 patients without big igf-ii, serum igf-ii levels were lower than those in the patients with big igf-ii, and serum igf-i levels were also low. serum igf-ii/igf-i ratios in the patients with big igf-ii were elevated and greater than those in the patients without big igf-ii (35.0+/-2.2 vs. 11.5+/-2.4). the present data indicate that igf-ii-producing tumors are not rare in nicth, and serum big igf-ii and igf-ii/igf-i ratio are useful for screening patients with igf-ii-producing nicth.
objectiveintracranial hypertension (ich) remains the single most difficult therapeutic challenge for the acute management of severe traumatic brain injury (tbi). we reviewed the published trials of therapeutic moderate hypothermia to determine its effect on ich and compared its efficacy to other commonly used therapies for ich.methodsa pubmed database search was done using various combinations of the search terms “brain injury,” “therapeutic hypothermia,” “intracranial hypertension,” “barbiturates,” “mannitol,” “hypertonic saline,” “hyperventilation,” “decompressive craniectomy,” and “csf drainage.”resultswe identified 11 prospective randomized clinical tbi trials comparing hypothermia vs. normothermia treatment for which intracranial pressure (icp) data was provided, and 6 prospective cohort studies that provided icp data before and during hypothermia treatment. in addition, we identified 37 clinical tbi studies of lumbar csf drainage, mannitol, hyperventilation, barbiturates, hypertonic saline, and decompressive craniectomy that provided pre- and posttreatment icp data. hypothermia was at least as effective as the traditional therapies for ich (hyperventilation, mannitol, and barbiturates), but was less effective than hypertonic saline, lumbar csf drainage, and decompressive craniectomy. ultimately, however, therapeutic hypothermia does appear to have a favorable risk/benefit profile.conclusiontherapeutic moderate hypothermia is as effective, or more effective, than most other treatments for ich. if used for 2–3 days or less there is no evidence that it causes clinically significant adverse events. the lack of consistent evidence that hypothermia improves long-term neurologic outcome should not preclude consideration of its use for the primary treatment of ich since no other icp therapy is held to this standard. background infectious complications are among the most serious problems that occur in severely head-injured patients treated with mild hypothermia. the mechanism underlying the susceptibility to infection has not been clarified. heat shock protein (hsp) 60 has been reported to play an essential role in innate immunity. thus, we conducted a study to clarify the impact of mild hypothermia on the expression of hsps in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnls) in severely head-injured patients.   methods between september 1997 and november 1999, 17 severely head-injured patients with a glasgow coma scale score of 8 or less at admission in whom intracranial pressure could be maintained below 20 mm hg by conventional therapy were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: a mild hypothermia group (ht group, nine patients) and a normothermia group (nt group, eight patients). the ht group was subjected to mild hypothermia (intracranial temperature, 34 degrees c) for 48 hours followed by rewarming at a rate of 1 degrees c per day for 3 days, whereas the nt group was subjected to normothermia (intracranial temperature, 37 degrees c) for 5 days. blood samples were serially obtained at three time points; days 0 to 1, days 2 to 5, and days 6 to 14 after head injury. we measured the expression of hsp27, hsp60, hsp70, and hsp90 by flow cytometry.   results the two groups were similar with respect to prognostic factors, and there was no difference in clinical outcome. the expression of pmnl hsp60 in the ht group was significantly lower in all three time periods compared with that in the nt group (p < 0.05), whereas expression of the other hsps did not differ significantly between the groups. the incidence of infectious complications was significantly increased in the ht group over that in the nt group (p < 0.05). in in vitro studies, pmnls from 10 healthy volunteers were incubated at 37 degrees c, 34 degrees c, or 26 degrees c for 1 hour with sodium arsenite (100 micromol/l), an hsp inducer. the expression of hsp60 at 26 degrees c and 34 degrees c was significantly lower than that at 37 degrees c (p < 0.05), whereas expression of the other hsps did not differ significantly at 26 degrees c, 34 degrees c, or 37 degrees c.   conclusion mild hypothermia reduces the expression of hsp60 in pmnls from severely head-injured patients. thus, mild hypothermia may suppress innate immunity.
objectives to explore opinions of authors of published reports of clinical trials and cochrane systematic reviews on the causes and methods of preventing publication bias.   study design and setting an online questionnaire was developed and sent to researchers publishing in high-impact or national general medical journals, authors of cochrane systematic reviews, and a general population of researchers. open-ended questions about publication bias were qualitatively analyzed. we also held a focus group with experienced researchers and/or cochrane reviewers.   results publication bias was common: 48 (36%) respondents had own unpublished trials and 40 (30%) admitted selective outcome reporting; but researchers felt strongly that blame rested also with the system that promotes and augments publication bias practices. qualitative analysis of both survey responses and focus group discussion identified possible ways of reducing publication bias through increased transparency, improvements to trial registries, search engines and databases, enhancement of the role of institutional review boards, positive encouragement of scientists, and policy changes.   conclusion although well aware of the problem, clinical researchers knowingly contribute to problems of selective reporting and nonpublication of trials. they call for changes in current practices of journal-based communication of trial reporting and for systematic evaluation of measures to decrease publication bias. aims to identify trends in the demographic and smoking characteristics of new callers to the new zealand quitline, a national free-phone smoking cessation service, between 2001 and 2005. methods demographic and smoking behaviour of quitline callers were routinely collected by quit advisors over the phone. characteristics of new callers were extracted from the client database, and compared across 5 years to determine changes over time. results statistically significant differences were found in all variables (except for gender) across the 5-year period. the results show an increased proportion of callers are under 25 years old (67% increase), started smoking at 15 years old or older (10% increase), and/or have smoked for less than 10 years (86% increase). there is also an increased proportion of callers smoking roll-your-own cigarettes (13% increase). in terms of ethnicity, the proportion of pacific people using the quitline increased by 54%, while the proportion of māori callers fluctuated at just above 20% of all new callers. the proportion of pregnant callers also increased over time (127% increase) although the overall percent remains small. conclusions the results indicate notable changes in the characteristics of new quitline callers between 2001 and 2005. such information will be of benefit to the future design of quitline marketing and adapting service provision to best meet the needs of callers. new zealand’s national free-phone quitline was established in 1999. since then, no analysis has been conducted to identify trends in characteristics of callers over time. similar research appears to be lacking in other countries, where researchers have built profiles using accumulated statistics without addressing changes over time. this study therefore aimed to explore this aspect by analysing the demographic and smoking characteristics of new callers registering with the new zealand quitline during the 5 years from 2001 to 2005. in november 2000, the new zealand quitline became a world-first by providing heavily subsidised nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) in the form of patches and gum as an adjunct to its telephone smoking cessation service. prior to the introduction of nrt, quitline callers received information and practical strategies for quitting, along with proactive follow-up calls from a quit advisor for quit support and advice. with the new service, callers are eligible to receive nrt when certain conditions are met (such as a satisfactory medical history and a commitment to quit). the availability of heavily subsidised nrt (a 92% reduction in the over-the-counter price) was well received by the smoking population, evidenced in the sharp increase of callers that was sustained for several years. this was similar to a more recent experience in minnesota, usa where the quitline offering free patches and gum to callers.
backgroundleft ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) is a potent risk factor for sudden death and congestive heart failure.methodswe tested the effect of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor (10 mg/kg, given orally, starting 2 days prior to banding, till sacrifice on day 14), on the development of lvh following aortic banding in rats.resultsthe latter resulted in significant lvh caused by both an increase in cardiomyocyte volume and interstitial collagen deposition. the observed lvh was entirely blocked by sorafenib downregulating both of these components. lvh was associated with pdgf-bb and tgfβ1 overexpression, as well as phosphorylation of c-raf and erk1/2. additionally, the transcription factors c-myc and c-fos leading to proliferation as well as the hypertrophy-inducing transcription factor gata4 and its regulated gene anp were all upregulated in response to aortic banding. all these overexpressions and upregulations were inhibited upon sorafenib treatment.conclusionwe show that sorafenib exhibits a regulatory role on the occurrence of lvh following ab in rats by blocking the rise in growth factors pdgf-bb and tgfβ1, activation of the corresponding c-raf-erk1/2 signaling pathway and effector mechanisms, including gata4 and anp. this effect of sorafenib may be of clinical importance in modulating the maladaptive hypertrophic response to pressure overload. the natriuretic peptides (nps) are a group of peptide hormones that play important roles in the control of renal, cardiovascular, endocrine, and skeletal homeostasis. atrial np (anp) was first identified as an activity by de bold et al1 in 1981. it is a 28 amino acid peptide in humans that assumes a hairpin structure by virtue of a cystine bridge that links residues 7 and 23 (figure 1). brain np (bnp), also known as the b-type np, is 32 amino acids long in the human. it has a similar hairpin structure but demonstrates considerably more heterogeneity across species than anp. c-type np (cnp) is a 22 amino acid peptide that has a truncated carboxy terminus beyond the second cystine residue in the bridge.     figure 1. primary structure of human nps.    anp and bnp are produced primarily within the muscle cells of the heart. anp shows a preference for expression in the cardiac atria versus ventricle, whereas bnp is more equivalently expressed throughout the heart. anp is also expressed in the hypothalamus where it is thought to control blood pressure (bp), sympathetic outflow, vasopressin secretion, drinking behavior, and cardiovascular homeostasis. bnp, on the other hand, is expressed in the brains of only a few species (eg, pig and dog), where its function remains unknown. cnp is expressed in the central nervous system, reproductive tract, bone, and endothelium of blood vessels.  there are 3 different types of np receptors, and each of them spans the membrane bilayer as a single transmembrane segment. the type a np receptor (npr-a) is also known as the particulate guanylyl cyclase a. it is the high affinity receptor for both anp and bnp. a schematic of the structure of this receptor is presented in figure 2. npr-a has a glycosylated, extracellular, ligand-binding domain linked to …
zwitterionic diazeniumdiolate, a nitric oxide precursor, was dissolved in basic buffer solution (ph=9.0) and encapsulated in thermo-sensitive liposomes composed of phospholipids of different sensitive temperatures. the basic intra-liposomal environment dramatically delayed spontaneous no release. when the liposomes were placed in physiological buffer solution and temperatures were increased to the sensitive temperatures of the phospholipids' membranes, extra-liposomal protons started to influx to collapse the ph gradient and subsequently induce a significant no release. moreover, the presence of a stronger ph gradient when the liposomes were applied to a more acidic environment caused a higher proton influx driving force to trigger the influx of protons and, subsequently, no release. in this work, we demonstrate that thermo-sensitive liposomes can be used to create a stable ph gradient in a nanoenvironment entrapping zwitterionic diazeniumdiolate for sustained and heat/acid-activated no release. selected nucleophile/nitric oxide adducts [compounds which contain the anionic moiety, xn(o-)n = o] were studied for their ability to release nitric oxide spontaneously in aqueous solution and for possible vasoactivity. the diversity of structures chosen included those in which the nucleophile residue, x, was that of a secondary amine [et2n, as in [et2nn(n = o)o]na, 1], a primary amine [iprhn, as in [iprhnn(n = o)o]na, 2], a polyamine, spermine [as in the zwitterion h2n(ch2)3nh2+(ch2)4n[n(n = o)o-](ch2)3nh2, 3], oxide [as in na[on(n = o)o]na, 4], and sulfite [as in nh4[o3sn(n = o)o]nh4, 5]. the rate constants (k) for decomposition in ph 7.4 phosphate buffer at 37 degrees c, as measured by following loss of chromophore at 230-260 nm, were as follows: 1, 5.4 x 10(-3) s-1; 2, 5.1 x 10(-3) s-1; 3, 0.30 x 10(-3) s-1; 4, 5.0 x 10(-3) s-1; and 5, 1.7 x 10(-3) s-1. the corresponding extents of nitric oxide release (eno) were 1.5, 0.73, 1.9, 0.54, and 0.001 mol/mol of starting material consumed, respectively, as determined from the integrated chemiluminescence response. vasodilatory activities expressed as the concentrations required to induce 50% relaxation in norepinephrine-constricted aortic rings bathed in ph 7.4 buffer at 37 degrees c (ec50) were as follows: 1, 0.19 microm; 2, 0.45 microm; 3, 6.2 microm; 4, 0.59 microm; and 5, 62 microm. vasorelaxant potency (expressed as 1/ec50) was strongly correlated with the quantity of .no calculated from the physicochemical data to be released in the interval required to achieve maximum relaxation at the ec50 doses (r = 0.995). this suggests that such nucleophile/.no adducts might generally be useful as vehicles for the nonenzymatic generation of nitric oxide, in predictable amounts and at predictable rates, for biological purposes. the particular significance for possible drug design is underscored in the very favorable potency comparison between several of these agents and the established nitrovasodilators sodium nitroprusside and glyceryl trinitrate (ec50 values of 2.0 and greater than 10 microm, respectively) in parallel aortic ring tests.
the aim of this study was to observe the relationship between dose–volume histogram (dvh) parameters and rectal late side effects (lse) in computed tomography (ct)‐based brachytherapy (bt) for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. in total, 144 cervical cancer patients received external beam radiotherapy and ct‐based bt. the data from 111 survival cases with pelvic local control (lc) were used to analyze the relationship between dvh parameters and rectal lse. the total doses, manifesting 2, 1, and 0.1 cm3 (d2cc, d1cc, and d0.1cc) of the rectum, and d90 for high‐risk clinical target volume (hr ctv) were computed and normalized to 2 gy fractions (eqd2) using a linear‐quadratic model. the rectal lse were evaluated by the late effects in normal tissues‐subjective, objective, management, and analytic (lent‐soma) scale. a dose–response relationship was evaluated by probit analyses. for all patients, the total rate of rectal lse was 56%, and the rate of ≥grade 2 lse was 27.4%. for the 111 survival cases with pelvic lc, the total mean for d2cc was 71.23 ± 5.54 gy for the rectum, and the d2cc, d1cc, and d0.1cc values for grades 2 and 3 were higher than those for grades 0 and 1. in addition, the number of complications increased, and the complications became more severe as the dose increased, with a dose of 73.5 gy resulting in a 10% probability of ≥grade 3 lse. in conclusion, dvh parameters could predict the incidence and grades of rectal lse in ct‐based bt. d2cc showed an excellent predictive value, and 73.5 gy for d2cc of the rectum might be considered as an alternative dose limit. background and aim we aimed to quantify target volume delineation uncertainties in cervix cancer image guided adaptive brachytherapy (igabt).   materials and methods ten radiation oncologists delineated gross tumour volume (gtv), high- and intermediate-risk clinical target volume (hr ctv, ir ctv) in six patients. their contours were compared with two reference delineations (staple-simultaneous truth and performance level estimation and ec- expert consensus) by calculating volumetric and planar conformity index (vci and pci) and inter-delineation distances (idd).   results vcistaple and vciec were 0.76 and 0.72 for hr ctv, 0.77 and 0.68 for ir ctv and 0.59 and 0.58 for gtv. variation was most prominent caudally and cranially in all target volumes and posterolaterally in ir ctv. iddstaple and iddec for hr ctv (3.6±3.5 and 3.8±3.4 mm) were significantly lower than for gtv (4.8±4.2 and 4.2±3.5 mm) and ir ctv (4.7±5.2 and 5.2±5.6 mm) (p<0.05).   conclusions due to lower delineation uncertainties when compared to gtv and ir ctv, hr ctv may be considered most robust volume for dose prescription and optimization in cervix cancer igabt. adequate imaging, training and use of contouring recommendations are main strategies to minimize delineation uncertainties.
good tracking performance is in general attributed to accurate representation over previously obtained targets and/or reliable discrimination between the target and the surrounding background. in this work, a robust tracker is proposed by integrating the advantages of both approaches. a subspace is constructed to represent the target and the neighboring background, and their class labels are propagated simultaneously via the learned subspace. in addition, a novel criterion is proposed, by taking account of both the reliability of discrimination and the accuracy of representation, to identify the target from numerous target candidates in each frame. thus, the ambiguity in the class labels of neighboring background samples, which influences the reliability of the discriminative tracking model, is effectively alleviated, while the training set still remains small. extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms most state-of-the-art trackers. in this paper, we propose a generative tracking method based on a novel robust linear regression algorithm. in contrast to existing methods, the proposed least soft-thresold squares (lss) algorithm models the error term with the gaussian-laplacian distribution, which can be solved efficiently. based on maximum joint likelihood of parameters, we derive a lss distance to measure the difference between an observation sample and the dictionary. compared with the distance derived from ordinary least squares methods, the proposed metric is more effective in dealing with outliers. in addition, we present an update scheme to capture the appearance change of the tracked target and ensure that the model is properly updated. experimental results on several challenging image sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracker achieves more favorable performance than the state-of-the-art methods.
backgroundmany clinical studies have demonstrated that early postoperative enteral nutrition (en) improved the postroperative course. post-pancreaticoduodenectomy (pd), patients tend to suffer from postoperative nausea, abdominal distention, and diarrhoea, causing difficulty in the introduction of en. in this pilot study, we investigated the appropriate nutritional mode post-pancreatic surgery.methodsbetween october 2006 and march 2007 2 postoperative nutritional methods were implemented in 17 patients in a prospective single-centere study. eight patients received only enteral nutrition (en group) and 9 patients received enteral nutrition combined with parenteral nutrition (en + pn group).resultsthere were no differences in the patient characteristics and postoperative morbidity between the 2 groups. the rate of discontinuance of enteral feeding was significantly high in the en group, and the duration of enteral feeding was significantly longer in the en + pn group. the central venous line was retained for a significantly longer period in the en + pn group, but there was no difference in the frequency of catheter-related infection between the 2 groups.conclusionen combined with pn is more adequate for patients after pancreatic surgery. patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (pd) often require postoperative artificial nutrition. this trial was undertaken to evaluate whether the route of administration and the composition of the postoperative nutritional support could affect the immunometabolic response and outcome. a prospective, randomized trial was carried out in 212 subjects who underwent pd. patients were randomized to receive a standard enteral formula (standard group, n = 73) or an enteral formula enriched with arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, and rna (immunonutrition group, n = 71), or total parenteral nutrition (parenteral group, n = 68). postoperative feeding started 6 hours after surgery. the three regimens were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. assessed parameters were phagocytosis ability of polymorphonuclear cells, plasma interleukin-2 receptors, c-reactive protein, retinol binding protein, tolerance of enteral feeding, rate of postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay (los). full nutritional goal (25 kcal/kg) was achieved in 87% of enterally fed patients versus 95% in the parenteral group. subjects receiving immunonutrition had a significantly better recovery of the immunometabolic parameters on postoperative day 8 compared to the other two groups. the rate of postoperative complications was lower in the immunonutrition group (33.8%) than in either the standard (43.8%) or parenteral group (58.8%) (p = 0.005 immunonutrition vs. parenteral). also, the mean los was shorter in the immunonutrition group than in the standard and parenteral groups (15.1 vs. 17.0 vs. 18.8 days, respectively;p < 0.05). early postoperative enteral feeding may safely and effectively replace parenteral nutrition in patients undergoing pd. immunonutrition ameliorates the immunometabolic response and improves outcome compared to parenteral feeding.
calcium hydroxide has been used extensively in dentistry for a century. despite its widespread use as a pulp-capping agent, its mechanisms of action still remain ambiguous. understanding its modes of action will lead to a broader understanding of the mechanisms associated with induced dentinogenesis and help in optimizing the currently available agents to target specific regenerative processes to obtain the best possible clinical outcomes. a literature search relating to mechanisms of dentinogenesis of calcium hydroxide up to december 2011 was carried out using pubmed and medline database searches as well as manual searching of cross-references from identified studies. resulting suggestions regarding dentinogenic mechanisms of calcium hydroxide range from direct irritating action of the material to induction of release of biologically active molecules. the purpose of this article is to discuss various mechanisms through which calcium hydroxide may induce tertiary dentinogenesis in the light of observations made in included studies. lipopolysaccharide (lps), a cell wall component of gram negative anaerobic bacteria, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of periapical disease resulting from infected root canals. calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] has been shown to be an effective medicament in such infections, reducing the microbial titre within the canal. it has been proposed that the therapeutic effect of ca(oh)2 may also be the result of direct inactivation of lps. the aim of this study was to investigate whether the toxic potential of an escherichia coli lps could be reduced or eliminated by ca(oh)2. four concentrations of e. coli lps ranging from 1-1000 ng/ml sterile water were incubated in duplicate either with 25 mg ca(oh)2 or sterile water alone. controls consisted of ca(oh)2 without lps or sterile water only. monocytes were collected from peripheral blood by centrifuging through a gradient and plated to a specific density. adherent monocytes were incubated for 4 days at 37 degrees c with 5% co2 in m199 medium with 10% autologous serum. the different lps solutions were added to the wells on day 5. after 4 h the supernatants were collected and quantitatively assayed for tnf-alpha using a commercial elisa kit. statistical analysis was performed with anova. results indicated that ca(oh)2 is able to eliminate the ability of an e. coli lps to stimulate tnf-alpha production in peripheral blood monocytes (p < 0.0001).
we phenotypically characterized 43 leishmanial parasites from cutaneous leishmaniasis by isoenzyme electrophoresis and the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (23 mcabs). identifications revealed 11 (25.6%) strains of leishmania (v.) braziliensis, 4 (9.3%) of l. (v.) shawi shawi, 7 (16.3%) of l. (v.) shawi santarensis, 6 (13.9%) of l. (v.) guyanensis and l. (v.) lainsoni, 2 (4.7%) of l. (l.) amazonensis, and 7 (16.3%) of a putative hybrid parasite, l. (v.) guyanensis/l. (v.) shawi shawi. mcabs detected three different serodemes of l. (v.) braziliensis: i-7, ii-1, and iii-3 strains. among the strains of l. (v.) shawi we identified two populations: one (7 strains) expressing the b19 epitope that was previously considered to be species-specific for l. (v.) guyanensis. we have given this population sub-specific rank, naming it l. (v.) s. santarensis. the other one (4 strains) did not express the b19 epitope like the l. (v.) shawi reference strain, which we now designate as l. (v.) s. shawi. for the first time in the eastern brazilian amazon we register a putative hybrid parasite (7 strains), l. (v.) guyanensis/l. (v.) s. shawi, characterized by a new 6pgdh three-band profile at the level of l. (v.) guyanensis. its pgm profile, however, was very similar to that of l. (v.) s. shawi. these results suggest that the lower amazon region – western pará state, brazil, represents a biome where l. (v.) guyanensis and l. (v.) s. shawi exchange genetic information. this paper is a review of the major historical events leading to our present classification of the neotropical leishmania species, and apart from indicating the basic type of disease these different parasites may cause in humans, it does not discuss the clinical or epidemiological features of the leishmaniases. for each of these species, information is given on the known geographical distribution, recorded phlebotomine sand fly host(s) and the secondary, wild or domestic mammalian hosts. reasons are given for regarding the parasite referred to as leishmania (l.) infantum chagasi, the causative agent of american visceral leishmaniasis, as most probably indigenous to the neotropics rather than imported during the iberian colonisation.
root branching order supports a powerful approach to understanding complex root systems; however, how the pattern of root morphological characteristics, tissue carbon (c) and nitrogen (n) concentrations, and root lifespan are related to anatomical features of variable root orders for mature shrubs (∼19 years old) in sandy habitats is still unclear. in this study, these relationships were investigated for three typical shrubs in horqin sand land, northeast china. root diameter, individual root length, tissue carbon concentration, c:n ratio, root lifespan, root cross-sectional area (csa), stele csa, proportion of stele in root csa, mean xylem vessel csa and the number of xylem vessels all increased with root order for the three shrubs, while specific root length and nitrogen concentration decreased with root order. the combined root biomass of the first two orders accounted for more than 63% of the first–fourth order root biomass for all the three shrubs. proportion of stele to root csa and number of xylem vessels of third-order root segments were significantly higher than that of the first two orders, and third-order roots showed secondary development with a continuous cork layer. all first-order and most second-order roots exhibited primary development, had an intact cortex, a lower proportion of stele to root csa, and a smaller number of vessels. our research suggests that the first two order roots of shrubs in sandy habitats are responsible mainly for absorption, and that they play a major role in root turnover and c and n flux in the soil organic matter pool due to their high proportion of biomass and n concentration, as well as their short lifespan. we used minirhizotrons to determine patterns of root longevity andturnover for the perennial bunchgrass bouteloua gracilisinthe shortgrass steppe of eastern colorado, usa. we hypothesized that rootlongevity would be partially controlled by root diameter, following previouslyobserved patterns in woody plants. in addition, we hypothesized that rootturnover would be greatest in surface soil horizons and decrease with depth dueto variation in soil moisture availability and temperature. root longevity wascorrelated with root diameter. median life span of roots > 0.4mm was approximately 320 days, while roots < 0.2mmhad a median life span of 180 days. there was approximately a 6%decreasein the likelihood of mortality with a 0.10-mm increase inroot diameter, controlling for the effect of depth in the soil profile. rootlength production and mortality were highest in the upper20 cm of the soil profile and decreased with depth.however,because root length density also decreased with depth, there were nosignificantdifferences in turnover rate of root length among sampling intervals. turnoverwas approximately 0.86 yr−1 based on root length production,while turnover was 0.35 yr−1 using root length mortality as ameasurement of flux. the imbalance between turnover estimates may be aconsequence of the time the minirhizotrons were in place prior to imaging or mayresult from our lack of over-winter measures of mortality. our worksuggests that bouteloua gracilis roots have complex lifehistory strategies, similar to woody species. some portion of the root systemishighly ephemeral, while slightly larger roots persist much longer. thesedifferences have implications for belowground carbon and nitrogen cycles in theshortgrass steppe.
highly energy-efficient oxide-confined 850-nm singlemode vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (vcsels) for optical interconnects are presented. error-free (defined as a bit error ratio <; 1 × 10-12) data transmission at 17 and 25 gb/s across 100 m of multimode optical fiber is achieved with a low dissipated heat energy of only 69 and 99 fj/bit, respectively. at 17 and 25 gb/s, the transmission distance is increased to 1000 and 600 m, respectively. to date, our vcsels are the most energy-efficient directly modulated lasers for data transmission across distances up to 1 km of multimode optical fiber. we present extremely energy-efficient oxide-confined 850-nm single-mode vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (vcsels) for optical interconnects. error-free transmission at 17 gb/s across 1 km of multimode optical fiber is achieved with an ultra-low energy-to-data ratio of 99 fj/bit, corresponding to a record-low energy-to-data-distance ratio of 99 fj/(bit ·km). this performance is achieved without changing any of the driving parameters up to 55 °c. to date our vcsels are the most energy-efficient directly modulated light-sources for data transmission across all distances up to 1 km of multimode optical fiber.
background frataxin, the mitochondrial protein deficient in friedreich ataxia, a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder, is thought to be involved in multiple iron-dependent mitochondrial pathways. in particular, frataxin plays an important role in the formation of iron-sulfur (fe-s) clusters biogenesis. methodology/principal findings we present data providing new insights into the interactions of mammalian frataxin with the fe-s assembly complex by combining in vitro and in vivo approaches. through immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that the main endogenous interactors of a recombinant mature human frataxin are iscu, nfs1 and isd11, the components of the core fe-s assembly complex. furthemore, using a heterologous expression system, we demonstrate that mammalian frataxin interacts with the preformed core complex, rather than with the individual components. the quaternary complex can be isolated in a stable form and has a molecular mass of ≈190 kda. finally, we demonstrate that the mature human fxn81–210 form of frataxin is the essential functional form in vivo. conclusions/significance our results suggest that the interaction of frataxin with the core iscu/nfs1/isd11 complex most likely defines the essential function of frataxin. our results provide new elements important for further understanding the early steps of de novo fe-s cluster biosynthesis. frataxin is an essential mitochondrial protein whose reduced expression causes friedreich's ataxia (frda), a lethal neurodegenerative disease. it is believed that frataxin is an iron chaperone that participates in iron metabolism. we have tested this hypothesis using the bacterial frataxin ortholog, cyay, and different biochemical and biophysical techniques. we observe that cyay participates in iron-sulfur (fe-s) cluster assembly as an iron-dependent inhibitor of cluster formation, through binding to the desulfurase iscs. the interaction with iscs involves the iron binding surface of cyay, which is conserved throughout the frataxin family. we propose that frataxins are iron sensors that act as regulators of fe-s cluster formation to fine-tune the quantity of fe-s cluster formed to the concentration of the available acceptors. our observations provide new perspectives for understanding frda and a mechanistic model that rationalizes the available knowledge on frataxin.
artificial streams were set up to test the relationship between near-bed water velocity and periphyton growth. periphyton community samples collected from a japanese stream were incubated for 44 days under a light intensity of 252 ± 72 μmol·photons/m2·s, a temperature of 20–25 °c, and three near-bed water velocity classes: low ( 32.8 cm/s). a logistic model was applied to estimate the maximum net growth rate (μmax) and carrying capacity (bmax). a response surface method was also applied to estimate chlorophyll a (chl-a) and ash-free dry mass (afdm) with respect to the independent variables (i.e., time and water velocity). we detected both the highest μmax (1.99 d−1) and highest bmax (7.01 mg/m2) for chl-a at the moderate water velocity. for afdm, we observed the highest μmax (0.57 d−1) and bmax (1.47 g/m2) at the low and moderate velocity classes, respectively. the total algae density in the region of moderate velocity at the end of the experiment was 6.47 × 103 cells/cm2, corresponding to levels 1.7 and 1.3 times higher than those at lower and higher velocities, respectively. our findings indicated that the moderate near-bed water velocity provided favorable conditions for algal growth and corresponding biomass accumulation. current velocity is a pervasive feature of lotic systems, yet this defining environmental variable is rarely examined as a factor for regulating stream herbivory. to investigate how current modifies herbivory in the upper colorado river, u.s.a., loops of electrified fencing wire were used to reduce in situ grazer densities on 30 × 30 cm tile substrates. after 45 d, electrified tiles had significantly fewer grazers (p = 0.03) and >2x more algal biomass than controls (p = 0.0002). reduced grazing on electrified tiles yielded periphytic assemblages having more diatoms and chlorophytes, as well as greater algal species richness. current velocity effects alone did not significantly regulate algal abundance; however, the interaction between current velocity and grazer exclusion resulted in more algae in slow vs. fast current (p = 0.02). grazer abundances were similar between fast and slow current velocities, suggesting that grazers in the colorado river differ in their ability to regulate algae across the current velocity gradient. our results indicate that stream current-mediated herbivory in streams may be more important than is generally recognized.
nuclear localized her family receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks) have been observed in primary tumor specimens and cancer cell lines for nearly two decades. inside the nucleus, her family members (egfr, her2, and her3) have been shown to function as co-transcriptional activators for various cancer-promoting genes. however, the regions of each receptor that confer transcriptional potential remain poorly defined. the current study aimed to map the putative transactivation domains (tads) of the her3 receptor. to accomplish this goal, various intracellular regions of her3 were fused to the dna binding domain of the yeast transcription factor gal4 (gal4dbd) and tested for their ability to transactivate gal4 uas-luciferase. results from these analyses demonstrated that the c-terminal domain of her3 (ctd, amino acids distal to the tyrosine kinase domain) contained potent transactivation potential. next, nine her3-ctd truncation mutants were constructed to map minimal regions of transactivation potential using the gal4 uas-luciferase based system. these analyses identified a bipartite region of 34 (b1) and 27 (b2) amino acids in length that conferred the majority of her3’s transactivation potential. next, we identified full-length nuclear her3 association and regulation of a 122 bp region of the cyclin d1 promoter. to understand how the b1 and b2 regions influenced the transcriptional functions of nuclear her3, we performed cyclin d1 promoter-luciferase assays in which her3 deleted of the b1 and b2 regions was severely hindered in regulating this promoter. further, the overexpression of her3 enhanced cyclin d1 mrna expression, while her3 deleted of its identified tads was hindered at doing so. thus, the ability for her3 to function as a transcriptional co-activator may be dependent on specific c-terminal tads. purpose: the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) inhibitor gefitinib (iressa) has shown antitumor activity in clinical trials against cancers, such as non–small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc). research on non–small cell lung cancer has elucidated factors that may predict response to gefitinib. less is known about molecular markers that may predict response to gefitinib in hnscc patients. experimental design: we analyzed possible associations of responsiveness to gefitinib with molecular markers of the egfr/erbb receptor family signaling pathway using 10 established hnscc lines in vitro. ic50 of gefitinib sensitivity was determined using clonogenic survival assays. erbb signaling was assessed by western and real-time reverse transcription-pcr analyses of egfr, erbb2, erbb3, and erbb4 expression levels as well as by phosphorylation analysis of pegfr, perbb2, perbb3, pakt, and perk. egfr sequences encoding kinase domain and egfr gene copy numbers were determined by cdna sequencing and real-time pcr, respectively. finally, responsiveness to gefitinib was compared with responsiveness to the anti-egfr antibody cetuximab (erbitux). results: expression levels of perbb2 (p = 0.02) and total erbb3 protein (p = 0.02) associated with resistance to gefitinib. combining gefitinib with pertuzumab (omnitarg), an antibody targeting erbb2 heterodimerization, provided additional growth-inhibitory effect over gefitinib alone on relatively gefitinib-resistant hnscc cell lines. the same markers did not predict resistance to cetuximab. in contrast, a similar trend suggesting association between egfr gene copy number and drug sensitivity was observed for both gefitinib (p = 0.0498) and cetuximab (p = 0.053). no activating egfr mutations were identified. conclusions:egfr amplification may predict sensitivity to gefitinib in hnscc. however, other egfr/erbb receptor family members than egfr may contribute to resistance to gefitinib. erbb2 and erbb3 may have potential as predictive markers and as therapeutic targets for combination therapy in treatment of hnscc with gefitinib.
backgroundmicrornas (mirnas) modulate expressions of inflammatory genes, thereby regulating inflammatory responses. single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in mirnas could affect their efficiency in binding to messenger rnas (mrnas).objectivewe investigated the associations of mirna snps with asthma phenotypes. mir-196a2 (rs11614913 t>c), mir-146a (rs2910164 c>g), and mir-499 (rs3746444 a>g) were genotyped in 347 asthma patients and 172 normal healthy controls (ncs).resultsthe ct/cc genotype of mir-196a2 rs11614913 was associated with eosinophilic asthma (p = 0.004) and a higher sputum eosinophil count compared with the tt genotype (p = 0.003). the cg/gg genotype of mir-146a rs2910164 tended to be associated with higher bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (pc20) compared with the cc genotype. the ag/gg genotype of mir-499 rs3746444 was associated with higher predicted values of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (%fev1) compared with the aa genotype (p = 0.008).conclusionsgenetic polymorphisms in mir-196a2, mir-146a, and mir-499 could be potential biomarkers for asthma phenotypes and targets for asthma treatments in a korean population. to identify proteins that might play an important role in allergen‐induced asthma, we analyzed lung extracts prepared from allergen (ovalbumin)‐challenged animals in a mouse model of this condition. the combination of two‐dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry revealed that annexin‐1, a 37 kda anti‐inflammatory protein that inhibits the activity of cytosolic phospholipase a2 (cpla2), was down‐regulated by allergen challenge in the lungs of ovalbumin‐sensitized mice. immunoblot analysis showed that this effect of ovalbumin challenge was attributable to proteolytic cleavage of annexin‐1. the ovalbumin‐induced degradation of annexin‐1 was blocked by pretreatment of mice with the antioxidant n‐acetylcysteine (nac) or with sodium selenite, both of which have previously been shown to exert anti‐inflammatory effects in this asthma model. ovalbumin challenge also both increased the expression of cpla2 in lung tissue and reduced the extent of the interaction between cpla2 and annexin‐1, and these effects were inhibited by nac or selenite. moreover, the concentrations of cysteinyl leukotrienes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and of leukotriene b4 in lung tissue were increased by ovalbumin challenge in a nac‐ or selenite‐sensitive manner. together, these results suggest that allergen‐induced oxidative stress results in proteolysis of annexin‐1 and consequent up‐regulation of cpla2 activity and leukotriene production in this mouse model of asthma, and that the anti‐inflammatory effects of selenite may provide a basis for the development of new antiasthmatic drugs.
an increase in the availability of data on the influenza a viruses (iav) has enabled the identification of the potential determinants of iav host specificity using computational approaches. in this study, we proposed an alternative approach, based on the adjusted rand index (ari), for the evaluation of genomic signatures of iavs and their ability to distinguish hosts they infected. our experiments showed that the host-specific signatures identified using the ari were more characteristic of their hosts than those identified using previous measures. our results provided updates on the host-specific genomic signatures in the internal proteins of the iav based on the sequence data as of february 2013 in the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi). unlike other approaches for signature recognition, our approach considered not only the ability of signatures to distinguish hosts (according to the ari), but also the chronological relationships among proteins. we identified novel signatures that could be mapped to known functional domains, and introduced a chronological analysis to investigate the changes in host-specific genomic signatures over time. our chronological analytical approach provided results on the adaptive variability of signatures, which correlated with previous studies’ findings, and indicated prospective adaptation trends that warrant further investigation. influenza a viruses may cross species barriers and transmit to humans with the potential to cause pandemics. interplay of human- (pb2 627k) and avian-like (pb2 627e) influenza polymerase complexes with unknown host factors have been postulated to play a key role in interspecies transmission. here, we have identified human importin-α isoforms (α1 and α7) as positive regulators of human- but not avian-like polymerase activity. human-like polymerase activity correlated with efficient recruitment of α1 and α7 to viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vrnps) without affecting subcellular localization. we also observed that human-like influenza virus growth was impaired in α1 and α7 downregulated human lung cells. mice lacking α7 were less susceptible to human- but not avian-like influenza virus infection. thus, α1 and α7 are positive regulators of human-like polymerase activity and pathogenicity beyond their role in nuclear transport.
purpose triple negative (tn) breast cancers which lack expression of the estrogen (er), progesterone (pr), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (her2) receptors convey a poor prognosis due in part to a lack of targeted therapies. methods to identify viable targets for the treatment of tn disease, we have conducted a gene set enrichment analysis (gsea) on seven different breast cancer whole genome gene expression cohorts comparing tn vs. er + her2 − to identify consistently enriched genes that share a common promoter motif. the seven cohorts were profiled on three different genome expression platforms (affymetrix, illumina and rnaseq) consisting in total of 2088 samples with ihc metadata. results gsea identified enriched gene expression patterns in tn samples that share common promoter motifs associated with sox9, e2f1, hif1a, hmga1, myc bach2, cebpb, and gcnf/nr6a1. unexpectedly, nr6a1 an orphan nuclear receptor normally expressed in germ cells of gonads is highly expressed in tn and er + her2 − samples making it an ideal drug target. conclusion with the increasing number of large sample size breast cancer cohorts, an exploratory analysis of genes that are consistently enriched in tn sharing common promoter motifs allows for the identification of possible therapeutic targets with extensive validation in patient derived data sets. we have identified and cloned a novel member of the nuclear receptor superfamily from murine testis, referred to as retinoid receptor-related testis-associated receptor or rtr. degenerate pcr primers homologous to two conserved regions of the dna-binding domain of members of this superfamily were employed to identify this gene. the amino-acid sequence of rtr is most closely related to that of the mouse rxrs with an overall identity of 32-34%; the highest similarity (61%) is observed in the dna-binding domain. northern blot analysis using rna from multiple tissues showed that rtr is predominantly expressed in the testis. northern blot analysis using rna from different testicular cell types showed that rtr mrna is not expressed in early germ cells or sertoli cells but is most abundant in round spermatids. our observations suggest that this putative transcription factor plays a role in the regulation of gene expression particularly during the post-meiotic phase of spermatogenesis.
background the german cockroach, blattella germanica, is an important insect pest that transmits various pathogens mechanically and causes severe allergic diseases. this insect has long served as a model system for studies of insect biology, physiology and ecology. however, the lack of genome or transcriptome information heavily hinder our further understanding about the german cockroach in every aspect at a molecular level and on a genome-wide scale. to explore the transcriptome and identify unique sequences of interest, we subjected the b. germanica transcriptome to massively parallel pyrosequencing and generated the first reference transcriptome for b. germanica. methodology/principal findings a total of 1,365,609 raw reads with an average length of 529 bp were generated via pyrosequencing the mixed cdna library from different life stages of german cockroach including maturing oothecae, nymphs, adult females and males. the raw reads were de novo assembled to 48,800 contigs and 3,961 singletons with high-quality unique sequences. these sequences were annotated and classified functionally in terms of blast, go and kegg, and the genes putatively coding detoxification enzyme systems, insecticide targets, key components in systematic rna interference, immunity and chemoreception pathways were identified. a total of 3,601 ssrs (simple sequence repeats) loci were also predicted. conclusions/significance the whole transcriptome pyrosequencing data from this study provides a usable genetic resource for future identification of potential functional genes involved in various biological processes. insect os-d-like proteins, also known as chemosensory (csp) or sensory appendage proteins (sap), are broadly expressed in various insect tissues, where they are thought to bind short to medium chain length fatty acids and their derivatives. although their specific function remains uncertain, os-d-like members have been isolated from sensory organs (including the sensillum lymph in some cases), and a role in olfaction similar to that of the insect odorant binding proteins (obp) has been suggested for some. we have identified 15 new os-d-like sequences: four from cdna clones described herein and 11 from sequence databases. the os-d-like genes from the anopheles gambiae, apis mellifera, drosophila melanogaster, and drosophila pseudoobscura genomes typically have single, small introns with a conserved splice site. together with all family members entered on genbank, a total of 70 os-d-like proteins, representing the insect orders diptera, dictyoptera, hymenoptera, lepidoptera, orthoptera, and phasmatodea, were analyzed. a neighbor joining distance phenogram identified several protein similarity classes that were characterized by highly conserved sequence motifs, including (a) n-terminal yttkydn(v/i)(n/d)(l/v)deil, (b) central dgkelkxx(i/l)pdal, and (c) c-terminal kydp. in contrast, three similarity classes were characterized by their diversion from these conserved motifs. the functional importance of conserved amino acid residues is discussed in relation to the crystal and nmr structures of mbracspa6.
central vein catheterization is a common procedure performed on patients under intensive care. the safe and successful placement of the central venous catheter depends on vein size. although used for this purpose, the trendelenburg position can be hazardous in some patients. the aim of this study was to compare the effects of the trendelenburg and passive leg raising (plr) positions on the size of the right internal jugular vein (ijv) in mechanically ventilated patients under intensive care. seventy-eight mechanically ventilated patients under intensive care were included into the study. sonographic images of the right ijv were recorded in supine (control), 10° trendelenburg and 40° plr positions. anterior-posterior and transverse diameter, cross-sectional area (csa), and depth were calculated from the recorded images. the size of the right ijv (csa, transverse and vertical diameters) was significantly larger in the trendelenburg and plr positions than in supine position. an increase of 26% in the ijv csa was obtained in the trendelenburg position and 23% in the plr position, compared to the supine position. there was no significant difference between the measurements obtained from the trendelenburg and plr positions. the study shows that the trendelenburg and plr positions increase the size of the ijv to a similar extent in mechanically ventilated patients under intensive care. background the trendelenburg position is used to distend the central veins, improving both the success and safety of vascular cannulation. the purpose of this study was to measure the cross-sectional area (csa) of the internal jugular vein (ijv) in three different positions using surface ultrasonography.   methods fifty-one subjects were enrolled. a sono site titan 180 or m-turbo portable ultrasound machine with a 10.5-mhz broadband linear surface probe was used. we measured the csa of the ijv (at end-expiration at the level of the cricoid cartilage) in three positions: 15° reverse trendelenburg, supine, and 15° trendelenburg.   results the mean csa at 15° reverse trendelenburg was 0.83 cm2 (sd, 0.86), in the supine position it was 1.25 cm2 (sd, 0.98), and at -15° trendelenburg it was 1.47 cm2 (sd, 1.03). moving from reverse trendelenburg to supine, the csa increased by 50%. in contrast, lowering the head to a trendelenburg position increased the mean csa by only 17%. surprisingly, trendelenburg positioning reduced the csa in nine of the 51 subjects.   conclusions trendelenburg positioning augments the csa only modestly, on average, compared with the supine position, and in some patients it reduces the csa.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov; no.: nct01099254; url: www.clinicaltrials.gov.
the open service gateway initiative (osgi) specification defines a dynamic java-based service oriented architecture for networked environments such as home service gateways. to provide isolation between different services, it relies on the java class loading mechanism. while class loaders have many advantages beside isolation, they are poor in protecting the system against malicious or buggy services. in this paper, we propose a new approach for service isolation. it is based on the java isolate technology, without a task-oriented architecture. our approach is more tailored to service-oriented architectures and in particular offers a complete isolation abstraction to the osgi platform. it is currently under development, hence we do not provide in this paper any technical details nor results. to date, systems offering multitasking for the javatm programming language either use one process or one class loader for each application. both approaches are unsatisfactory. using operating system processes is expensive, scales poorly and does not fully exploit the protection features inherent in a safe language. class loaders replicate application code, obscure the type system, and non-uniformly treat ‘trusted’ and ‘untrusted’ classes, which leads to subtle, but nevertheless, potentially harmful forms of undesirable inter-application interaction. in this paper we propose a novel, simple yet powerful solution. the new model improves on existing designs in terms of resource utilization while offering strong isolation among applications. the approach is applicable both on high-end servers and on small devices. the main idea is to maintain only one copy of every class, regardless of how many applications use it. classes are transparently and automatically modified, so that each application has a separate copy of its static fields. two prototypes are described and selected performance data is analyzed. various aspects of the proposed architectural changes to the java virtual machine are discussed.
follicular dendritic cells (fdcs) and complement receptor (cr)1 and complement receptor (cr)2 are important for the generation of humoral immunity. cr1/2 expression on b cells and fdcs was shown to provide a secondary signal for b cell activation, to facilitate transport of ag in immune follicles, and to enhance retention of immune complexes by fdcs. we show in this study that murine b cells predominantly express the cr2 product from the cr2 gene, whereas fdcs almost exclusively express the cr1 isoform generated from the cr2 gene. to define the specific role of cr1, we created an animal that maintains normal cell-restricted expression of cr2 but does not express cr1. cr1-deficient (cr1ko) mice develop normal b1 and b2 immature and mature b cell subsets and have normal levels of naive serum abs but altered levels of natural abs. immunization of the cr1ko animal demonstrates deficient ab responses to t-dependent, but not t-independent, ags. germinal centers from the immunized cr1ko animal possess a deficiency in activated b cells, similar to that seen for animals lacking both cr1 and cr2 or c3. finally, animals lacking only cr1 respond similarly to wild-type animals to infections with streptococcus pneumoniae, a pathogen to which animals lacking c3 or both cr1 and cr2 are particularly sensitive. altogether, these data suggest that the production of cr1, primarily by fdcs, is critical in the generation of appropriately activated b cells of the germinal center and the generation of mature ab responses. a ntibodies (igs) are the major effectors of the adaptive immune response, and different isotype classes of ab are produced to achieve different effects with ab of the same specificity. ig class-switch recombination is a hallmark of b cell responses to t-dependent (td) ags (1). these reactions occur within immune follicles of secondary immune structures, such as the spleen and lymph nodes (2). central to follicles are follicular den-dritic cells (fdcs), which establish the zonal identity (3) and act as a concentrated depot of ag. in the course of an immune challenge, ag is trafficked to the fdcs (4–6), where follicular b cells are recruited for surveillance of retained ag. bcr specificity for an ag retained on an fdc results in internalization and processing for presentation to t cells. the b cell then migrates to the t cell zone and presents the processed peptide to th cells in the context of class ii mhc. upon a secondary signal … affinity maturation of the humoral immune response by somatic hypermutation is marked by a rapid and dramatic increase in affinity for the eliciting antigen. we suggest that the optimal mutation schedule is one in which periods of rapid mutation alternate with periods of mutation-free growth. the multicompartmental structure of the germinal center, together with re-entry of positively selected b cells back into the germinal center, will naturally implement such a schedule, thereby providing an anatomical basis for the efficiency of the germinal center reaction.
the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae), a model of multiple sclerosis, has been studied in mice that were (i) vitamin d-deficient, (ii) minus the vitamin d receptor, (iii) minus a vitamin d 25-hydroxylase, and (iv) minus the vitamin d 25-hydroxyvitamin d-1α-hydroxylase. eae development was markedly suppressed in mice lacking the vitamin d receptor and partially suppressed in vitamin d-insufficient mice. however, the absence of either of the two key hydroxylases (i.e., 25-hydroxylase and 1α-hydroxylase) neither inhibits nor enhances the development of eae. these results indicate that vitamin d and the vitamin d receptor are required for the development of eae. the results also suggest that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 may not play a role in this autoimmune response. a protective association between higher vitamin d levels and the onset of multiple sclerosis (ms) has been demonstrated; however, its role in modulating ms clinical course has been little studied. we investigated whether higher levels of serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin d (25‐oh‐d) were associated with a lower risk of relapses in people with ms.
background hypo-magnesemia is described to occur in as many as 65% of intensive care unit (icu) patients. magnesium (mg) is a cofactor in over 300 enzymatic reactions involving energy metabolism, protein, and nucleic acid synthesis. the membrane pump that creates the electrical gradient across the cell membrane is dependent on mg, and it is important in the activity of electrically excitable tissues. since mg regulates the movement of calcium in smooth muscle cells, it is also important in peripheral vascular tone and blood pressure. studies have linked hypo-magnesemia to multiple chronic diseases and to a higher mortality rate. methods to explore trends within our own tertiary care surgical icu, we sampled our patients’ laboratory records in 2001 and in 2011. hypo-magnesemia in our icu is defined as an mg less than 2.0 mg/dl. results this retrospective review of all sicu patients from october to december revealed that there was a significant increase (p < 0.01) in the patients with their serum mg level measured between 2001 (89%) and 2011 (95%). there was a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in patients with hypomagnesemia (< 2 mg/dl) between 2001 (47.5%) and 2011 (33.0%). on the other hand, there was a significant increase (p < 0.001) in patients with normal serum mg level (> 2 mg/dl) between 2001 (52.5%) and 2011 (67.0%). conclusions there was not only more monitoring of mg in 2011, but a lower incidence of hypo-mg compared to 2001. possible explanations include changing patterns of antibiotic and diuretic use, less amphotericin use, more frequent laboratory surveillance, and better trained icu practitioners. magnesium deficiency and hypomagnesemia remain quite prevalent, particularly in patients in intensive care units, and may have important clinical consequences. magnesium should be measured directly in clinical circumstances in which a risk for magnesium deficiency exists and appropriately corrected when found. this commentary reviews the current knowledge of magnesium homeostasis and the risk factors and clinical consequences of magnesium deficiency and outlines approaches to therapy.
a stochastic, mathematical model of a farrow-finish pig herd was developed and used to investigate the within-herd transmission dynamics of prrsv, and to examine patterns of on-farm persistence and fade-out. the model was structured to represent the management of a typical european pig herd. three parameters determining the natural history of infection were derived from the literature. transmission parameters were chosen using prrsv antibody data from a cross-sectional study of 103 pig herds (evans et al., 2008). the seroprevalence by age was generated from the model at 21-day intervals and was compared to the cross-sectional field data using log-likelihood, accounting for the accuracy of the elisa test used. the model was run for various isolation practices of purchased gilts, contact structure, herd size and the frequency of re-introduction of infectious gilts. the time-dependent log-likelihood patterns varied between herds in a similar way to patterns observed from serological values from the 103 farms. essentially they indicated two patterns of seroprevalence: herds in which prrsv was stably persistent, and herds in which prrsv was unstable, either recently introduced or recently faded-out. with a herd size of 327 sows with identical management, fade-out of virus occurred within 4 weeks in 21.9% of simulations. without isolation of gilts from sows, fade-out within 250 days decreased from 81.6% to 14.3% and for herd sizes of 75, 150, 300 and 600, the probability of persistence of virus for >1200 days was 4%, 13.4%, 20.4% and 18.2%, respectively. introduction of virus at a rate of approximately 0.37 times per year resulted in virus persisting for >1200 days in 32.4% of simulations, compared with 17.6% for no re-introduction. fade-out of virus was most likely to occur within breeding females before virus reached young stock. persistence was more likely once prrsv was present in piglets which in turn infected rearing-pigs. the probability of persistence was higher with increased herd size, increased contact between different age groups and increased re-introduction of infectious gilts. the ability of the model to capture the variability in cross-sectional, age-related serological patterns suggests that the processes of re-introduction, persistence and fade-out of prrsv play critical roles in prrsv epidemiology. the potential importance to pig production and transmission of virus between herds is discussed. the aim of this study was to determine whether porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) could be transmitted by aerosol under field conditions. a total of 210 five-month-old prrsv-negative pigs were housed in a mechanically ventilated finishing facility containing 11 pens. pen 1 contained 10 pigs (indirect contact controls) and pen 2 remained empty, providing a barrier of 2.5 m from the remaining pigs in pens 3 to 11. fifteen or 16 of the pigs in each of pens 3 to 11 were infected experimentally with a field isolate of prrsv and the other six or seven pigs served as direct contact controls. five days after the pigs were infected, two trailers containing 10 five-week-old prrsv-naive sentinel pigs were placed along each side of the building; one was placed 1 m from the exhaust fans on one side of the building, and the other was placed 30 m from the fans on the other side, and the sentinel pigs remained in the trailers for 72 hours. they were then moved to separate buildings on the same site, 30 and 80 m, respectively, from the infected barn, and their prrsv status was monitored for 21 days. the direct and indirect contact control pigs became infected with prrsv but the sentinel pigs did not.
parabens are alkyl esters of p‐hydroxybenzoic acid used widely as antimicrobial preservatives in consumer products, including pharmaceuticals, foods and cosmetics. we showed previously that methyl‐, butyl‐ and propylparaben parabens, even at low doses, stimulate the proliferation of mcf‐7 breast cancer cells and non‐transformed mcf‐10a breast epithelial cells. the present study was undertaken to determine whether this represents a direct effect on cell cycle and apoptotic gene expression. mcf‐7 and mcf‐10a cells were exposed to methyl, butyl‐ and propylparaben (20 nm) or 17β‐estradiol (10 nm). cell cycle and apoptotic gene expression were evaluated by real‐time polymerase chain reaction and protein expression by western blot. 17β‐estradiol upregulated g1/s phase genes and downregulated cell cycle progression inhibitors in both mcf‐7 and mcf‐10a. upregulation of bcl‐xl and downregulation of caspase 9 was observed in mcf‐7, while upregulation of bcl‐xl, bcl2l2 and caspase 9 was noted in mcf‐10a. cyclins in mcf‐7 cells were not affected by any of the parabens. methyl‐ and butylparaben had no effect on the expression of selected apoptotic genes in mcf‐7. in mcf‐10a, all parabens tested increased the expression of g1/s phase genes, and downregulated cell cycle inhibitors. methylparaben increased pro‐survival gene. butylparaben increased bcl2l1 gene, as did 17β‐estradiol, while propylparaben upregulated both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. there are differences in cell cycle and apoptosis gene expression between parabens and 17β‐estradiol in mcf‐7 cells. in mcf‐10a cells, most of the genes activated by parabens were comparable to those activated by 17β‐estradiol. copyright © 2014 john wiley & sons, ltd. backgroundwidely accepted somatic mutation theory of carcinogenesis states that mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in genomes of somatic cells is the cause of neoplastic transformation. identifying frequent mutations in cancer cells suggests the involvement of mutant genes in carcinogenesis.resultsto develop an in vitro model for the analysis of genetic alterations associated with breast carcinogenesis, we used random mutagenesis and selection of human non-tumorigenic immortalized breast epithelial cells mcf-10a in tissue-culture conditions that mimic tumor environment. random mutations were generated in mcf-10a cells by cultivating them in a tissue-culture medium containing the frameshift-inducing agent icr191. the first selective condition we used to transform mcf1-10a cells was cultivation in a medium containing mutagen at a concentration that allowed cell replication despite p53 protein accumulation induced by mutagen treatment. the second step of selection was either cell cultivation in a medium with reduced growth-factor supply or in a medium that mimics a hypoxia condition or growing in soft agar. using mutagenesis and selection, we have generated several independently derived cultures with various degrees of transformation. gene identification by nonsense-mediated mrna decay inhibition (gini) analysis has identified the icr191-induced frameshift mutations in the tp53, smoothelin, ras association (ralgds/af-6) domain family 6 (rassf6) and other genes in the transformed mcf-10a cells. the tp53 gene mutations resulting in the loss of protein expression had been found in all independently transformed mcf-10a cultures, which form large progressively growing tumors with sustained angiogenesis in nude mice.conclusionidentifying genes containing bi-allelic icr191-induced frameshift mutations in the transformed mcf-10a cells generated by random mutagenesis and selection indicates putative breast-tumor suppressors. this can provide a model for studying the role of mutant genes in breast carcinogenesis.
background difficulties with the direct antiglobulin test (dat) and its apparent lack of sensitivity and specificity for immune‐mediated hemolytic anemia (imha) in dogs have raised skepticism regarding its diagnostic value. objective to compare different dats and other hematologic parameters in dogs. animals anticoagulated blood samples from 59 nonanemic and 46 anemic dogs (± imha) from a research colony and veterinary clinics. methods prospective observational study: immunochromatographic strip, gel microcolumn, and capillary techniques were compared with standard microtiter dat using 2 polyvalent antiglobulins. spherocytosis, autoagglutination, osmotic fragility, and clinical data were assessed. results blood samples from all 59 nonanemic dogs were dat‐. among 46 anemic dogs, 33 were suspected of imha, but only 20 were dat+. old and new dat methods yielded comparable and consistent results even after storage of chilled blood samples for 1 week. spherocytosis and autoagglutination (that did not persist after washing) were noted in 15 and 16 dat+ dogs, respectively. the other 26 anemic dogs, including 21 previously transfused dogs and 4 with autoagglutination, tested dat‐ by the other methods. osmotic fragility was increased in 70% (19/27) of anemic and all 15 dat+ dogs tested. limited follow‐up testing revealed dat+ results for 3–70 days. conclusions and clinical importance the novel strip and capillary dat methods are promising adjunct in‐clinic tools. despite prior immunosuppressive treatment and presence of autoagglutination, the dat was positive in anemic dogs with imha. transfusion did not cause false dat+ results. our results support dat as a cornerstone in the diagnosis of canine imha. the coombs' test can detect both immunoglobulin and complement on the surface of rbcs, and as such can be of value as an aid in the diagnosis of imha. techniques that may improve sensitivity include use of monovalent reagents, increased dilutions of antiglobulin to avoid a prozone effect, and testing at 4°c. these techniques are not without controversy, and positive tests should always be interpreted in the presence of other clinical and hematologic evidence for imha. alternate techniques, such as flow cytometry, can improve detection of rbc-bound immunoglobulin, but require a flow cytometer and further standardization between laboratories.
the last step of cysteine biosynthesis in bacteria and plants is catalyzed by o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase. in bacteria, two isozymes, o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-a and o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-b, have been identified that share similar binding sites, although the respective specific functions are still debated. o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase plays a key role in the adaptation of bacteria to the host environment, in the defense mechanisms to oxidative stress and in antibiotic resistance. because mammals synthesize cysteine from methionine and lack o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, the enzyme is a potential target for antimicrobials. with this aim, we first identified potential inhibitors of the two isozymes via a ligand- and structure-based in silico screening of a subset of the zinc library using flap. the binding affinities of the most promising candidates were measured in vitro on purified o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-a and o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-b from salmonella typhimurium by a direct method that exploits the change in the cofactor fluorescence. two molecules were identified with dissociation constants of 3.7 and 33 µm for o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-a and o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-b, respectively. because grid analysis of the two isoenzymes indicates the presence of a few common pharmacophoric features, cross binding titrations were carried out. it was found that the best binder for o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-b exhibits a dissociation constant of 29 µm for o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-a, thus displaying a limited selectivity, whereas the best binder for o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-a exhibits a dissociation constant of 50 µm for o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase-b and is thus 8-fold selective towards the former isozyme. therefore, isoform-specific and isoform-independent ligands allow to either selectively target the isozyme that predominantly supports bacteria during infection and long-term survival or to completely block bacterial cysteine biosynthesis. abstract the bifunctional protein complex, cysteine synthetase, in salmonella typhimurium is composed of the enzymes serine transacetylase and o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase. a point mutation (bb1) in the structural gene for serine transacetylase results in diminished catalytic activity of both components of the complex. enzyme inactivation studies using either specific o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase antiserum or heat show that the isolated o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase components of the mutant are indistinguishable from wild type o-acetyl-serine sulfhydrylase. when o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase from either wild type or mutant source is combined with serine transacetylase from a common source, their behavior is identical as measured by decrement in enzymic activity, immunological inactivation, and heat inactivation. thus, when hybrid cysteine synthetases, composed of one component from the wild type and one from the mutant, are investigated, the o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase components of such hybrid complexes behave like those found in the native cysteine synthetase from which the serine transacetylase component was derived. these studies establish that the diminished catalytic activity of the sulfhydrylase of the mutant results from the association of catalytically normal o-acetyl-serine sulfhydrylase with mutant serine transacetylase. the basis of the pleiotropic phenotype of mutant bb1 is, therefore, an alteration in protein-protein interaction resulting from a structural gene mutation.
cognitive effects of antidepressants and cognitive predictors of antidepressant treatment response are recent focuses of interest in the neuropsychology of depression. we studied the cognitive predictors of treatment response to bupropion and its neuropsychological effects in patients with major depressive disorder. twenty subjects meeting the dsm-iv criteria for major depressive disorder were assessed with the hamilton depression rating scale and a neuropsychological battery. subjects were medicated with 150 mg/day of bupropion sustained release for 8 weeks. at the end of the trial, 12 subjects were classified as responders to treatment and 8 were non-responders. our findings suggest that low pretreatment measures of visual memory and low levels of mental processing speed are predictive of good response to bupropion. the cognitive effects of bupropion after the treatment showed that patients improved in visual memory measures and in mental processing speed. our results suggest that cognitive predictors of treatment response to bupropion and cognitive effects of bupropion in patients with major depressive disorder could be closely related. these findings need to be replicated due to the exploratory nature of the present work. this was a 4-week, three-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled evaluation of the efficacy and safety of bupropion in hospitalized depressed patients. results from 27 placebo and 48 bupropion-treated patients were analyzed for efficacy and safety. assessments of efficacy and safety were made at baseline and weekly during the study. primary and secondary measures of efficacy included the clinical global impressions for severity (cgi-s) and improvement (cgi-i) of illness, hamilton depression and hamilton anxiety scales, and the zung self-rating scales for depression and anxiety. assessments of safety included vital signs, electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory tests, and adverse experiences. dosages of bupropion were 300–600 mg/day. results showed that bupropion was significantly (p<0.01) more effective than placebo at termination of study on the cgi-s, cgi-i, hamilton depression and hamilton anxiety scales. on the zung self-rating depression and anxiety scales, statistical trends favored bupropion at termination of study over placebo (p<0.10). adverse events in the bupropion and placebo groups were minimal with notable absence of sedation and anticholinergic-and cardiovascular-related side effects. we conclude that bupropion was significantly more effective than placebo in treating depression and accompanying anxiety in depressed inpatients.
cd10 predicts survival in different cancers. the prognostic significance in bladder cancer still has to be documented. one hundred fifty lymph node-positive bladder cancer patients were treated by cystectomy and standardized pelvic lymphadenectomy in curative intent. cd10 expression was evaluated in tissue microarrays (tmas) constructed from histopathological normal urothelium, primary tumor (tumor center and invasion front), and corresponding lymph node metastases and correlated with tumor characteristics (stage, extracapsular extension, number, and total diameter of metastases) and survival. cd10 expression was successively lost from normal urothelium to primary tumor to metastases (p < .05) and decreased from the tumor center to the invasion front (p < .002). high cd10 expression in tumor center or invasion front (p < .05) but not in the metastases predicted favorable outcome; the prognostic information in the tumor center was independent from tumor stage and lymph node parameters. high cd10 expression level was not associated with specific tumor characteristics. a well-defined sampling strategy for tmas allows detection of specific biomarker expression patterns and may generate prognostic information inherent in particular tumor areas. the favorable outcome in bladder cancer patients with high cd10 expression might suggest a tumor suppressive function of cd10. we tested 505 cases of nonhematopoietic neoplasms by immunohistochemistry using a newly characterized monoclonal antibody (clone 56c6) against the cd10 antigen. cd10 was expressed widely in neoplasms of the genitourinary tract, including 41 (89%) of 46 cases of renal cell carcinoma, 13 (54%) of 24 cases of transitional cell carcinoma, and 11 (61%) of 18 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma. in addition, 5 (100%) of 5 endometrial stromal sarcomas, 3 (60%) of 5 rhabdomyosarcomas, 7 (50%) of 14 pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 5 (45%) of 11 cases of schwannoma, and 12 (40%) of 30 cases of malignant melanoma also were positive for cd10. similar to normal tissue, cd10 positivity was restricted to the apical surface of malignant glandular cells of well-differentiated colonic, pancreatic, and prostatic adenocarcinoma, whereas in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and other tumors, such as melanoma, transitional cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and endometrial stromal sarcoma, the cd10 positivity showed diffuse cytoplasmic or membranous/golgi patterns. the monoclonal antibody clone 56c6 is a reliable marker for cd10 in paraffin immunohistochemistry after heat-induced epitope retrieval. cd10 expression in renal cell carcinoma and endometrial stromal sarcoma may be a useful marker in the differential diagnoses of these tumors because both tumors otherwise lack specific markers.
backgrounda prominent and distinctive feature of the rye (secale cereale) chromosomes is the presence of massive blocks of subtelomeric heterochromatin, the size of which is correlated with the copy number of tandem arrays. the rapidity with which these regions have formed over the period of speciation remains unexplained.resultsusing a bac library created from the short arm telosome of rye chromosome 1r we uncovered numerous arrays of the psc200 and psc250 tandem repeat families which are concentrated in subtelomeric heterochromatin and identified the adjacent dna sequences. the arrays show significant heterogeneity in monomer organization. 454 reads were used to gain a representation of the expansion of these tandem repeats across the whole rye genome. the presence of multiple, relatively short monomer arrays, coupled with the mainly star-like topology of the monomer phylogenetic trees, was taken as indicative of a rapid expansion of the psc200 and psc250 arrays. the evolution of subtelomeric heterochromatin appears to have included a significant contribution of illegitimate recombination. the composition of transposable elements (tes) within the regions flanking the psc200 and psc250 arrays differed markedly from that in the genome a whole. solo-ltrs were strongly enriched, suggestive of a history of active ectopic exchange. several dna motifs were over-represented within the ltr sequences.conclusionthe large blocks of subtelomeric heterochromatin have arisen from the combined activity of tes and the expansion of the tandem repeats. the expansion was likely based on a highly complex network of recombination mechanisms. bare-1 is a highly abundant, copia-like, ltr (long terminal repeat) retrotransposon in the genus hordeum. the ltrs provide the promoter, terminator, and polyadenylation signals necessary for the replicational life cycle of retrotransposons. we have examined the variability and evolution of bare-1-like elements, focusing on the ltrs. three groups were found, corresponding to each of the hordeum genome types analyzed, which predate the divergence of these types. the most variable ltr regions are tandem repeats near the 3′ end and the promoter. in barley (h. vulgare l.), two main classes of ltr promoters were defined, corresponding to bare-1 and to a new class we call bare-2. these can be considered as families within the group i bare elements. although less abundant in cultivated barley than is bare-1, bare-2 is transcriptionally active in leaves and calli. a sequenced bare-2 has more than 99% similar ltrs and perfect terminal direct repeats (tdrs), indicating it is a recent insertion, but the coding region, especially gag, is disrupted by frameshifts and stop codons. bare-2 appears to be a chimeric element resulting from retrotransposon recombination by strand switching during replication, with ltrs and 5′utr more similar to bare-1 and the rest more similar to wis-2. we provide evidence as well for another form of recombination, where ltr-ltr recombination has generated tandem multimeric bare-1 elements in which internal coding domains are interspersed with shared ltrs. the data indicate that recombination contributes to the complexity and plasticity of retroelement evolution in plant genomes.
objective serum cholesterol was reported to be associated with depressed mood, but the studies conducted among household population are rare.   methods we used the data of 4115 men and 4275 women aged 18 or older, who completed a depression screening interview and had blood collected as a part of the national health and nutrition examination survey, 2005-2008. the serum concentrations of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) were gender-specifically categorized into lower, intermediate, and upper quartiles. depression was measured using the patient health questionnaire, a 9-item screening instrument asking about the frequency of depression symptoms over the past 2 weeks.   results after adjustment for socio-demographics and behavioral risks, a u-shaped association was detected between severe depression and ldl-c among men. the odds ratios (ors) of severe depression were 5.13 (95% ci=1.74-15.09), 1 (reference) and 2.28 (1.07-4.86) respectively for the men with lower (<169 mg/dl), intermediate (169-221 mg/dl), and upper quartile (≥ 222 mg/dl) ldl-c. among women, lower hdl-c was significantly associated with an elevated odds of severe depression [or=2.96 (1.59-5.52)] compared with upper quartile of hdl-c, the association diminished after adjustment for covariates [or=1.24 (0.66-2.32)]. no clear pattern of association between cholesterol and moderate depression was observed from either men or women.   limitation the inherent limitation of cross-sectional design prevented the authors from investigating causality.   conclusions a u-shaped association was identified between ldl-c and severe depression among men. further studies are necessary to explore the biological mechanism and identify the clinical implication among populations vulnerable to psychiatric disorders. primary prevention trials which have shown that the lowering of serum cholesterol concentrations in middle-aged subjects by diet, drugs, or both leads to a decrease in coronary heart disease have also reported an increase in deaths due to suicide or violence. there has been no adequate explanation for this association. i have reviewed the relevant published work and describe a physiological mechanism that might account for this curious finding. one of the functions of serotonin in the central nervous system is the suppression of harmful behavioural impulses. when mouse brain synaptosomal membrane cholesterol is increased there is a pronounced increase in the number of serotonin receptors. low membrane cholesterol decreases the number of serotonin receptors. since membrane cholesterol exchanges freely with cholesterol in the surrounding medium, a lowered serum cholesterol concentration may contribute to a decrease in brain serotonin, with poorer suppression of aggressive behaviour.

incubating cells at elevated temperatures causes an inhibition of protein synthesis. mild heat stress at 41-42 degrees c inhibits the fraction of active, polysomal ribosomes from greater than 60% (preheating) to less than 30%. a return to 37 degrees c leads to an increase in protein synthesis, termed "recovery." continuous incubation at 41-42 degrees c also leads to a gradual restoration of protein synthesis (greater than 70% of ribosomes reactivated by 2-4 h), termed "adaptation". protein synthesis inhibition and reactivation is prestressed, recovered cells that contain elevated levels of the heat stress proteins occur to the same extent and at the same rate as in "naive" cells. the adaptation response requires transcription of new rna whereas recovery does not. a large number of phosphorylation changes are induced by severe heat stress and occur with kinetics similar to the inhibition of protein synthesis. these include phosphorylation of eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor (eif)- 2 alpha and dephosphorylation of eif-4b and eif-4fp25 (eif-4e). however, the extent to which the modification occurs is proportional to the severity of the stress, and, under mild (41-42 degrees c) heat stress conditions, these initiation factor phosphorylation changes do not occur. similarly, under conditions of severe heat stress eif-2 alpha and eif-4b frequently recover to their prestress phosphorylation state before the recovery of protein synthesis. eif-4e dephosphorylation likewise does not occur under mild heat stress conditions. therefore, these changes in phosphorylation states, which are thought to be sufficient cause, are not necessary for the inhibition of protein synthesis observed. heat shock at 45 degrees c virtually abolishes protein synthesis in hela cells, but return to 37 degrees c effects a complete recovery and the concomitant synthesis of heat shock-induced proteins. heat shock induces polysome disaggregation, indicating initiation is principally inhibited. in vitro assays for initiation factor activities reveal heat shock inhibits eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eif-2), eif-(3 + 4f), and eif-4b. immunoblot analyses show that eif-2 alpha and eif-2 beta become modified during heat shock, and eif-4b variants disappear. upon return to 37 degrees c, these alterations reverse. the modifications of eif-2 alpha and eif-4b are due to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. enzymatic activities induced by heat shock inhibit protein synthesis and modify initiation factors in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. initiation factor modifications may contribute to, or cause, protein synthesis inhibition.
retinoid-related orphan receptor (ror)α4 is the major rorα isoform expressed in adipose tissues and liver. in this study we demonstrate that rorα-deficient staggerer mice (rorα(sg/sg)) fed with a high-fat diet (hfd) exhibited reduced adiposity and hepatic triglyceride levels compared with wild-type (wt) littermates and were resistant to the development of hepatic steatosis, adipose-associated inflammation, and insulin resistance. gene expression profiling showed that many genes involved in triglyceride synthesis and storage, including cidec, cidea, and mogat1, were expressed at much lower levels in liver of rorα(sg/sg) mice. in contrast, overexpression of rorα in mouse hepatoma hepa1-6 cells significantly increased the expression of genes that were repressed in rorα(sg/sg) liver, including sult1b1, adfp, cidea, and apoa4. chip and promoter analysis suggested that several of these genes were regulated directly by rorα. in addition to reduced lipid accumulation, inflammation was greatly diminished in white adipose tissue (wat) of rorα(sg/sg) mice fed with an hfd. the infiltration of macrophages and the expression of many immune response and proinflammatory genes, including those encoding various chemo/cytokines, toll-like receptors, and tnf signaling proteins, were significantly reduced in rorα(sg/sg) wat. moreover, rorα(sg/sg) mice fed with an hfd were protected from the development of insulin resistance. rorα(sg/sg) mice consumed more oxygen and produced more carbon dioxide, suggesting increased energy expenditure in this genotype. our study indicates that rorα plays a critical role in the regulation of several aspects of metabolic syndrome. therefore, rorα may provide a novel therapeutic target in the management of obesity and associated metabolic diseases. homozygous staggerermice (sg/sg) display decreased anddysfunctional retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ror ) expression.we observed decreases in serum (and liver) triglycerides and total and high density lipoprotein serum cholesterol in sg/sgmice. moreover, the sg/sgmice were characterized by reduced adiposity (associated with decreased fat pad mass and adipocyte size). candidate-based expression profiling demonstrated that the dyslipidemia in sg/sg mice is associated with decreased hepatic expression of srebp-1c, and the reverse cholesterol transporters,abca1 andabcg1. this is consistent with the reduced serum lipids. the molecular mechanism did not involve aberrant expression of lxr and/or chrebp. however, chip and transfection analyses revealed that ror is recruited to and regulates the activity of the srebp-1c promoter. furthermore, the lean phenotype in sg/sg mice is also characterized by significantly increased expression of pgc-1 , pgc-1 , and lipin1mrna in liver andwhite andbrownadipose tissue from sg/sg mice. in addition, we observed a significant 4-fold increase in 2-adrenergic receptor mrna in brown adipose tissue. finally, dysfunctional ror expression protects against diet-induced obesity. following a 10-week high fat diet, wild-type but not sg/sg mice exhibited a 20% weight gain, increased hepatic triglycerides, and notable white and brown adipose tissue accumulation. in summary, these changes in gene expression (that modulate lipid homeostasis) in metabolic tissues are involved in decreased adiposity and resistance to dietinduced obesity in the sg/sg mice, despite hyperphagia. in conclusion, we suggest this orphan nuclear receptor is a key modulator of fat accumulation and that selective ror modulators may have utility in the treatment of obesity.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of using citric acid on false negative rates induced by ppis during (14)c-ubt in dyspeptic patients with h. pylori infection. in a crossover randomized controlled clinical trial, one hundred dyspeptic patients (46 females and 54 males) with determined h. pylori infection who referred to gastrointestinal outpatient clinic of razi hospital-rasht, iran. all the patients underwent a (14)c-ubt heliprobe(®) baseline test and the positive ones entered the second phase. they were divided randomly to two groups and started ppis treatment by pantoprazole (20 mg/daily pantozol(®) nycomed company) and underwent two other ubts in days 12-13 and 14-15 with and without 4 grams citric acid. in group i who underwent ubt with citric acid in days 12-13 (ubt2) and ubt without citric acid in days 14-15 (ubt3), there was no significant difference between the ubt results with and without citric acid (p≥0.05). in group ii who underwent ubt without citric acid in days 12-13 and ubt with citric acid in days 14-15, the false negative rates were not significantly different between ubt with and without citric acid (p≥0.05). in both groups the results of ubt without citric acid after pantoprazole consumption didn't change significantly compared to the baseline ubt. also the difference between the false negative rates of baseline ubt and ubt without citric acid was not significant (p>0.05). these results suggest that acidification of gastric environment during (14)c-ubt cannot prevent false negative results and do not increase the accuracy of the test in patients taking ppis. background/aims omeprazole, a benzimidazole proton pump inhibitor, has an antibacterial effect against helicobacter pylori at neutral ph and inhibits its urease activity. the aim of this study was to characterize h. pylori acid resistance and to determine whether omeprazole effects its survival at low ph.   methods we studied survival of h. pylori and other enteric organisms in buffered solutions (ph 2-7) in the presence or absence of 10 mmol/l urea and/or omeprazole.   results in the absence of urea, the acid tolerances of wild-type h. pylori, a urease-negative h. pylori mutant, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were similar. in the presence of urea, the survival of the wild-type h. pylori at ph 2 was significantly greater than that of the other organisms. omeprazole (100 micrograms/ml) had a marked inhibitory effect on the survival of both wild-type and urease-negative h. pylori at low ph, and similar effects on e. coli, p. mirabilis, and salmonella typhimurium.   conclusions whereas survival of h. pylori below ph 4 is urease dependent, h. pylori uses non-urease-mediated mechanisms at or above ph 4. omeprazole inhibits the survival of h. pylori at low ph through a mechanism independent of its effect on urease, an antibacterial effect that extends to other enteric bacteria.
drawing on social identity theory, we examine how whites’ race-related beliefs drive their reactions to race-based affirmative action policies (aaps). across laboratory and field settings, we find that whites with relatively high modern racism (mr) or collective relative deprivation (crd) beliefs perceive greater white disadvantage in organizations that have race-based aaps, than in organizations that do not. alternatively, race-based aaps do not lead to perceptions of white disadvantage among whites with relatively low mr and crd beliefs. we also find that white disadvantage mediates the relationship between the combined effects of race-based aaps, mr beliefs, and crd beliefs and the perceived fairness of the organization’s selection and promotion policies. our findings suggest that race-based aaps do not necessarily lead to perceptions of white disadvantage, but are contingent upon the interpretive lens of whites’ mr and crd beliefs, and also offer practical insights for preventing negative reactions to race-based aaps. the present experiments suggest that the desire to benefit the in-group drives dominant-group members' policy preferences, independent of concern for out-groups' outcomes. in experiment 1, the effect of a manipulation of affirmative action procedures on policy support was mediated by how whites expected the policy to affect fellow whites, but not by the expected effect on minorities. in experiments 2 and 3, when focused on losses for the white in-group, whites' racial identity was negatively related to support for affirmative action. however, when focused on gains for the black out-group or when participants were told that whites were not affected by the policy, racial identity did not predict attitudes toward the policy. in experiments 2 and 3, perceived fairness mediated these effects.

because the p300/cbp-mediated hyperacetylation of rela (p65) is critical for nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) activation, the attenuation of p65 acetylation is a potential molecular target for the prevention of chronic inflammation. during our ongoing screening study to identify natural compounds with histone acetyltransferase inhibitor (hati) activity, we identified epigallocatechin-3-gallate (egcg) as a novel hati with global specificity for the majority of hat enzymes but with no activity toward epigenetic enzymes including hdac, sirt1, and hmtase. at a dose of 100 micromol/l, egcg abrogates p300-induced p65 acetylation in vitro and in vivo, increases the level of cytosolic ikappabalpha, and suppresses tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha)-induced nf-kappab activation. we also showed that egcg prevents tnfalpha-induced p65 translocation to the nucleus, confirming that hyperacetylation is critical for nf-kappab translocation as well as activity. furthermore, egcg treatment inhibited the acetylation of p65 and the expression of nf-kappab target genes in response to diverse stimuli. finally, egcg reduced the binding of p300 to the promoter region of interleukin-6 gene with an increased recruitment of hdac3, which highlights the importance of the balance between hats and histone deacetylases in the nf-kappab-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway. importantly, egcg at 50 micromol/l dose completely blocks ebv infection-induced cytokine expression and subsequently the ebv-induced b lymphocyte transformation. these results show the crucial role of acetylation in the development of inflammatory-related diseases. ikappabalpha is an inhibitory molecule that sequesters nf-kappab dimers in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. upon stimulation, nf-kappab moves to the nucleus and induces the expression of a variety of genes including ikappabalpha. this newly synthesized ikappabalpha also translocates to the nucleus, removes activated nf-kappab from its target genes, and brings it back to the cytoplasm to terminate the phase of nf-kappab activation. we show here that ikappabalpha enhances the transactivation potential of several homeodomain-containing proteins such as hoxb7 and pit-1 through a nf-kappab-independent association with histone deacetylase (hdac) 1 and hdac3 but not with hdac2, -4, -5, and -6. ikappabalpha bound both hdac proteins through its ankyrin repeats, and this interaction was disrupted by p65. immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated further that ikappabalpha acts by partially redirecting hdac3 to the cytoplasm. at the same time, an ikappabalpha mutant, which lacked a functional nuclear localization sequence, interacted very efficiently with hdac1 and -3 and intensively enhanced the transactivation potential of pit-1. our results support the hypothesis that the nf-kappab inhibitor ikappabalpha regulates the transcriptional activity of homeodomain-containing proteins positively through cytoplasmic sequestration of hdac1 and hdac3, a mechanism that would assign a new and unexpected role to ikappabalpha.
the aim of the present study was to assess the possibility and efficacy of utilizing a laminin-chitosan-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid), otherwise known as laminin-chitosan-plga, nerve conduit with the co-transplantation of schwann and neural stem cells to repair peripheral nerve defects. previous in vitro experiments have demonstrated that the three-dimensional structure of the built in fiber filament electrospinning of laminin-chitosan-plga nerve conduit is beneficial to the migration and regeneration of nerve cells, and has notable mechanical strength and plasticity. it is able to provide support in the neural tissue regeneration process, and has the ability to degrade itself once peripheral nerves complete their regeneration, providing more advantages than other biological and synthetic materials. in the present study, 132 female sprague dawley rats were used to establish an animal model of laryngeal nerve injury, and the rats were randomly divided into six groups for experimentation. the nerve conduit was prepared and co-cultured with schwann and neural stem cells, and micro-surgical techniques were used to repair the 5-mm-long recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries. functional and histological assessments were performed at 8 and 12 weeks post-surgery, respectively. the results revealed that the laminin-chitosan-plga nerve conduit combined with schwann and neural stem cells was able to promote nerve regeneration (p<0.05), and its effect was superior to those of the autograft (p<0.05). the results of the present study suggest that this is the ideal method for repairing peripheral nerve defects, and cells in the graft may promote nerve regeneration. a number of surprising observations have shown that stem cells, in suitable conditions, have the ability to produce a whole spectrum of cell types, regardless, whether these tissues are derived from the same germ layer or not. this phenomenon is called stem cell plasticity, which means that tissue-specific stem cells are mutually interchangeable. in our experiments, as a model, we used neural stem cells (nscs) harvested from fetal (e14-15) neocortex and beta-galactosidase positive. in the first experiment we found that on days 12 and 30 after sub-lethal irradiation (ld 8.5 gy) and (beta-galactosidase(+)) nscs transplantation all mice survived, just as the group with bone marrow transplantation. moreover, the bone marrow of mice transplanted nscs contained the number of cfu-gm colonies with beta-galactosidase(+) cells which was as much as 50% higher. these differences were statistically significant, p<0.001. in the second experiment, we studied kinetics of (beta-galactosidase(+)) nscs after their transplantation to sub-lethally irradiated mice. histochemistry of tissues was performed on days 12 and 30 post-transplantation, and beta-galactosidase(+) cells were detected with the help of histochemical examination of removed tissues (lung, liver, spleen, thymus, and skeletal muscle). in tissues removed on day 12 post-transplantation, we found a significantly higher number of beta-galactosidase(+) cells in the spleen and thymus on day 30. while we presumed the presence beta-galactosidase(+) cells in the spleen, as spleen and reticuloendothelial system represent an important retaining system for different cell types, the presence of beta-galactosidase(+) cells in the thymus was rather surprising but very interesting. this indicates a certain mutual and close interconnection of transplanted stem cells and immune system in an adult organism. in the third experiment, we verified the mutual interchange of sca-1 surface antigen in the bone marrow cells and nscs before transplantation. analysis of this antigen showed 24.8% sca-1 positive cells among the bone marrow cells, while nscs were sca-1 negative. our experiments show that nscs share hemopoietic identity and may significantly influence the recovery of damaged hematopoiesis but do not have typical superficial markers as hscs. this result is important for the determination of predictive factors for hemopoiesis recovery, for stem cell plasticity and for their use in the cell therapy.
there is evidence that amyloid beta-protein (abeta) deposits or abeta intermediates trigger pathogenic factors in alzheimer's disease patients. we have previously reported that c-abl kinase activation involved in cell signalling regulates the neuronal death response to abeta fibrils (abeta(f)). in the present study we investigated the therapeutic potential of the selective c-abl inhibitor sti571 on both the intrahippocampal injection of abeta(f) and appsw/psen1deltae9 transgenic mice alzheimer's disease models. injection of abeta(f) induced an increase in the numbers of p73 and c-abl immunoreactive cells in the hippocampal area near to the lesion. chronic intraperitoneal administration of sti571 reduced the rat behavioural deficit induced by abeta(f), as well as apoptosis and tau phosphorylation. our in vitro studies suggest that inhibition of the c-abl/p73 signalling pathway is the mechanism underlying of the effects of sti571 on abeta-induced apoptosis for the following reasons: (i) abeta(f) induces p73 phosphorylation, the tap73 isoform levels increase so as to enhance its proapoptotic function, and all these effects where reduced by sti571; (ii) c-abl kinase activity is required for neuronal apoptosis and (iii) sti571 prevents the abeta-induced increase in the expression of apoptotic genes. furthermore, in the abeta-injected area there was a huge increase in phosphorylated p73 and a larger number of tap73-positive cells, with these changes being prevented by sti571 coinjection. moreover, the intraperitoneal administration of sti571 rescued the cognitive decline in appsw/psen1deltae9 mice, p73 phosphorylation, tau phosphorylation and caspase-3 activation in neurons around abeta deposits. besides, we observed a decrease in the number and size of abeta deposits in the appsw/psen1deltae9-sti571-treated mice. these results are consistent with the role of the c-abl/p73 signalling pathway in abeta neurodegeneration, and suggest that sti571-like compounds would be effective in therapeutic treatments of alzheimer disease. here, we investigated the intracellular mechanisms that underlie the relative invulnerability of adult versus developing dorsal root ganglion (drg) sensory neurons. in culture, adult neurons were resistant to stimuli that caused apoptosis of their neonatal counterparts. in both adult and neonatal neurons, death stimuli induced the apoptotic c-jun n-terminal protein kinase (jnk) pathway, but jnk activation only caused death of neonatal neurons, indicating that adult neurons have a downstream block to apoptosis. expression of the dominant-inhibitory p53 family member, δnp73, rescued jnk-induced apoptosis of neonatal neurons, suggesting that it might participate in the downstream apoptotic block in adult neurons. to test this possibility, we examined adult drg neurons cultured from p73+/- mice. adult p73+/- drg neurons were more vulnerable to apoptotic stimuli than their p73+/+ counterparts, and invulnerability could be restored to the p73+/- neurons by increased expression of δnp73. moreover, although drg neuron development was normal in p73+/- animals in vivo, axotomy caused death of adult p73+/- but not p73+/+ drg neurons. thus, one way adult neurons become invulnerable is to enhance endogenous survival pathways, and one critical component of these survival pathways is p73.
in this study we aimed to compare the findings of coronary dual-source computed tomography angiography of myocardial bridges with cadaveric dissections. forty-one isolated, non-damaged fresh sheep hearts were used in this study. myocardial bridges of the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery were demonstrated and analyzed by a coronary dual-source computed tomography angiography. dissections along the left anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery were performed by using zeiss opmi pico microscope and the length of the bridges were measured. the depths of the myocardial bridges were measured from the stained sections by using the light microscope (leica dm 6000b). mbs were found in all 41 hearts (100 %) during dissections. dual-source computed tomography angiography successfully detected 87.8 % (36 of the 41 hearts) of the myocardial bridges measured on left anterior interventricular branch of left coronary artery. the lengths of the myocardial bridges were found 5–40 and 8–50 mm with dissection and dual-source computed tomography angiography, respectively. and the depths were found 0.7–4.5 mm by dual-source computed tomography angiography and 0.745–4.632 mm morphologically. comparison of the mean values of the lengths showed statistically significantly higher values (22.0 ± 8.5, 17.7 ± 7.7 mm, p = 0.003) for the dissections. radiological assessment also effectively discriminated complete bridges from incomplete ones. our study showed that coronary computed tomography angiography is reliable in evaluating the presence and depth of myocardial bridges. our purpose in this study was to investigate the perivasculary space under the myocardial bridges (mb) in dog, sheep, goat and human hearts. a total of 160 hearts were studied, and perivasculary space under the myocardial bridges was examined under microscope. the specimens belonged to 25 dogs, 100 sheep, 25 goats and 10 humans. special attention was paid to evaluate the distance between the mb and coronary arteries (ca), ca and underlying myocardium (um) and to find the relation of concomitant vein number accompanying the ca and mb. 219 myocardial bridges were found in total of hearts, and specimens from these bridges were examined under microscope. there were large variations in distance between the mb and ca (0–714 µm) and distance between ca and um (0–309 µm). the myocardial bridges were classified into three groups in terms of the number of veins accompanying ca, the bridges with no concomitant veins with one concomitant vein and with two concomitant veins. this suggests that the distance between the mb and ca is crucial to determine how much force is on the ca. the environment surrounding the ca may be a crucial factor in determining whether the mb influences the induction of heart disorders or not.
introduction venous thromboembolism (vte) constitutes a major risk factor in hospitalized acutely ill medical patients. it has been demonstrated in numerous papers that by using different forms of prophylaxis, a significant reduction of the incidence of vte can be achieved. in this article we assessed the tendencies in the use of venous thromboprophylaxis (tp) at internal medicine departments in denmark. the results were compared with results from a similar study conducted in 2005.   material and methods all medical departments in denmark received a two-page questionnaire on tp. the recipients were asked to evaluate the frequency, use of local instructions, form of administration, side-effects and duration of tp at their departments. one reminder was sent out.   results a total of 188 responses were received (90% response rate), 16 were excluded. virtually all departments indicated that they used tp (92%). at intensive care units, the tp was used according to local guidelines at 77% of the wards and at the other subspecialties of internal medicine, tp was used in less than 50%. by far the most frequently used prophylaxis method was low molecular weight heparin, which was used by more than 80% of the departments. side-effects, most often superficial bleeding and haematomas, were reported in 25% of the cases. the following serious side-effects were reported: heparininduced thrombocytopenia (n = 2), stroke (n = 1) and gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 3). no difference was observed between the hospitals of larger cities and those of smaller cities.   conclusion in denmark, no significant increase in the use of tp at internal medicine departments has been observed since 2005. the guideline's strong recommendation of tp is still not reflected in daily practice.   funding not relevant.   trial registration not relevant. perioperative antithrombotic clinical regimens have reduced the incidence of postoperative deep venous thrombosis (dvt). long-term effects of asymptomatic postoperative dvt have been studied in a number of clinical trials and the present review describes the clinical significance of asymptomatic postoperative dvt regarding the possible development of postthrombotic syndrome (pts). we performed a systematic review of reference databases focusing upon studies including patients suspected of having postoperative dvt and reporting subsequent cases of pts at the end of a well-defined follow-up period. the included studies were stratified according to type of screening method and applied statistics. over-all evaluation included meta-analyses based upon the cochrane software package. the overall relative risk of developing pts was 1.58 (95% confidence intervals: 1.24-2.02) in patients suffering from asymptomatic dvt as compared to patients without dvt (p<0.0005). in conclusion, asymptomatic postoperative dvt is associated with an increased risk of late development of pts. the finding emphasizes that postoperative dvt, diagnosed by means of well-defined objective measures, remains the correct scientific endpoint in trials evaluating the efficacy of preoperative antithrombotic treatment regimens.
we have used fluorescent labeling, confocal microscopy and computer-assisted motion analysis to observe and quantify individual wild-type and myosin ii mutant cell behavior during early multicellular development in dictyostelium discoideum. when cultured with an excess of unlabeled wild-type cells, labeled control cells are randomly distributed within aggregation streams, while myosin ii mutant cells are found primarily at the lateral edges of streams. wild-type cells move at average rates of 8.5 +/- 4.9 microns/min within aggregation streams and can exhibit regular periodic movement at 3.5 minute intervals; half as long as the 7 minute period reported previously for isolated cells. myosin ii mutants under the same conditions move at 5.0 +/- 4.8 microns/min, twice as fast as reported previously for isolated myosin ii mutant cells, and fail to display regular periodic movement. when removed from aggregation streams myosin ii mutant cells move at only 2.5 +/- 2.0 microns/min, while wild-type cells under these conditions move at 5.9 +/- 4.5 microns/min. analysis of cell morphology further reveals that myosin ii mutant cells are grossly and dynamically deformed within wild-type aggregation streams but not when removed from streams and examined in isolation. these data reveal that the loss of myosin ii has dramatic consequences for cells undergoing multicellular development. the segregation of mutant cells to aggregation stream edges demonstrates that myosin ii mutants are unable to penetrate a multicellular mass of wild-type cells, while the observed distortion of myosin ii mutant cells suggests that the cortex of such cells is too flacid to resist forces generated during movement. the increased rate of mutant cell movement and distortion of mutant cell morphology seen within wild-type aggregation streams further argues both that movement of wild-type cells within a multicellular mass can generate traction forces on neighboring cells and that mutant cell morphology and behavior can be altered by these forces. in addition, the distortion of myosin ii mutant cells within wild-type aggregation streams indicates that myosin is not required for the formation of cell-cell contacts. finally, the consequences of the loss of myosin ii for cells during multicellular development are much more severe than has been previously revealed for isolated cells. the techniques used here to analyze the behavior of individual cells within multicellular aggregates provide a more sensitive assay of mutant cell phenotype than has been previously available and will be generally applicable to the study of motility and cytoskeletal mutants in dictyostelium. dictyostelium amebae have been engineered by homologous recombination of a truncated copy of the myosin heavy chain gene (heavy meromyosin (hmm) cells) and by transformation with a vector encoding an antisense rna to myosin heavy chain mrna (mhca cells) so that they lack native myosin heavy chain protein. in the former case, cells synthesize only the heavy meromyosin portion of the protein and in the latter case they synthesize negligible amounts of the protein. surprisingly, it was demonstrated that both cell lines are viable and motile. in order to compare the motility of these cells with normal cells, the newly developed computer-assisted dynamic morphology system (dms) was employed. the results demonstrate that the average hmm or mhca ameba moves at a rate of translocation less than half that of normal cells. it is rounder and less polar than a normal cell, and exhibits a rate of cytoplasmic expansion and contraction roughly half that of normal cells. in a spatial gradient of camp, the average ameba of hmm or mhca exhibits a chemotactic index of +0.10 or less, compared to the chemotactic index of +0.50 exhibited by normal cells. finally, the initial area, rate of expansion, and final area of pseudopods are roughly half that of normal cells. the five fastest hmm amebae (out of 35 analyzed in detail) moved at an average rate of translocation equal to that of normal amebae, and exhibited an average chemotactic index of +0.34. in addition, the average rate of cytoplasmic flow in fast hmm cells was equal to that of the average normal ameba. however, fast hmm amebae still exhibited the same defects in pseudopod formation that were exhibited by the entire hmm cell population. these results suggest that myosin heavy chain is involved in the "fine tuning" and efficiency of pseudopod formation, but is not essential for the basic behavior of pseudopod expansion.
abstract winged bean kunitz chymotrypsin inhibitor (wci) accumulates in an organ-specific and temporally regulated manner. the protein is encoded by a multigene family that includes at least four putative inhibitor-coding genes and three pseudogenes. the structure of the wci genes indicates that an insertion at a 5′ proximal site occurred after duplication of the ancestral wci gene and that several gene conversion events subsequently contributed to the evolution of this gene family. analysis of the promoter activity of the 5′ regions of the wci genes in transgenic tobacco showed that only the 5′ regions of the wci-3a and wci-3b genes, which encode the major wci protein in winged bean, promoted the organ-specific and temporally regulated expression of a reporter gene. the 5′ region of a pseudogene, the wci-p1 gene which contains frameshift mutations, exhibited constitutive promoter activity in tobacco, an indication that the 5′ region of the wci-p1 gene might spontaneously have acquired new regulatory sequences during evolution. since gene conversion is a relatively frequent event and since the homology between the wci-p1 and wci-3a/b genes is disrupted at a 5′ proximal site by remnants of an inserted sequence, the wci-p1 gene appears to be a possible intermediate that could be converted into a new functional gene with a distinct pattern of expression by a single gene-conversion event. conversion between duplicated genes limits their independent evolution. models in which conversion frequencies decrease as genes diverge are examined to determine conditions under which genes can "escape" further conversion and hence escape from a gene family. a review of results from various recombination systems suggests two classes of sequence-dependence models: (1) the "k-hit" model in which conversion is completely inactivated by a few (k) mutational events, such as the insertion of a mobile element, and (2) more general models where conversion frequency gradually declines as genes diverge through the accumulation of point mutants. exact analysis of the k-hit model is given and an approximate analysis of a more general sequence-dependent model is developed and verified by computer simulation. if mu is the per nucleotide mutation rate, then neutral duplicated genes diverging through point mutants are likely to escape conversion provided 2 mu/lambda much greater than 0.1, where lambda is the conversion rate between identical genes. if 2 mu/lambda much less than 0.1, the expected number of conversions before escape increases exponentially so that, for biological purposes, the genes never escape conversion. for single mutational events sufficient to block further conversions, occurring at rate nu per copy per generation, many conversions are expected if 2 nu/lambda much less than 1, while the genes essentially evolve independently if 2 nu/lambda much greater than 1. implications of these results for both models of concerted evolution and the evolution of new gene functions via gene duplication are discussed.
background: pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the united states and both incidence and mortality are highest in african americans. obesity is also disproportionately high in african americans, but limited data are available on the relation of obesity to pancreatic cancer in this population. methods: seven large prospective cohort studies pooled data from african american participants. body mass index (bmi) was calculated from self-reported height and weight at baseline. cox regression was used to calculate hrs and 95% confidence intervals (ci) for levels of bmi relative to bmi 18.5–24.9, with adjustment for covariates. primary analyses were restricted to participants with ≥5 years of follow-up because weight loss before diagnosis may have influenced baseline bmi in cases who died during early follow-up. results: in follow-up of 239,597 participants, 897 pancreatic cancer deaths occurred. hrs were 1.08 (95% ci, 0.90–1.31) for bmi 25.0 to 29.9, 1.25 (95% ci, 0.99–1.57) for bmi 30.0 to 34.9, and 1.31 (95% ci, 0.97–1.77) for bmi ≥35.0 among those with ≥5 years of follow-up (ptrend = 0.03). the association was evident among both sexes and was independent of a history of diabetes. a stronger association was observed among never-smokers (bmi ≥30 vs. referent: hr = 1.44; 95% ci, 1.02–2.03) than among smokers (hr = 1.16; 95% ci, 0.87–1.54; pinteraction = 0.02). conclusion: the findings suggest that obesity is independently associated with increased pancreatic cancer mortality in african americans. impact: interventions to reduce obesity may also reduce risk of pancreatic cancer mortality, particularly among never-smokers. cancer epidemiol biomarkers prev; 23(10); 2119–25. ©2014 aacr. overweight and obesity are health problems of epidemic proportions, increasing the risk not only of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus but also of various types of cancer. obesity is strongly associated with changes in the physiological function of adipose tissue, leading to insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and altered secretion of adipokines. several of these factors, such as insulin resistance, increased levels of leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and endogenous sex steroids, decreased levels of adiponectin, and chronic inflammation, are involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. this article reviews these mechanisms, focusing on adipose tissue dysfunction as a unifying causal factor. although understanding of the link between obesity and cancer might provide therapeutic targets, preventing overweight and obesity still remains number one priority.

this paper presents a technique for visualizing large spatial data sets in web mapping systems (wms). the technique creates a hierarchical clustering tree, which is subsequently used to extract clusters that can be displayed at a given scale without cluttering the map. voronoi polygons are used as aggregation symbols to represent the clusters. this technique retains hierarchical relationships between data items at different scales. in addition, aggregation symbols do not overlap, and their sizes and the number of points that they cover is controlled by the same parameter. a prototype has been implemented and tested showing the effectiveness of the method for visualizing large data sets in wms. information visualisation is about gaining insight into data through a visual representation. this data is often multivariate and increasingly, the datasets are very large. to help us explore all this data, numerous visualisation applications, both commercial and research prototypes, have been designed using a variety of techniques and algorithms. whether they are dedicated to geo-spatial data or skewed hierarchical data, most of the visualisations need to adopt strategies for dealing with overcrowded displays, brought about by too much data to fit in too small a display space. this paper analyses a large number of these clutter reduction methods, classifying them both in terms of how they deal with clutter reduction and more importantly, in terms of the benefits and losses. the aim of the resulting taxonomy is to act as a guide to match techniques to problems where different criteria may have different importance, and more importantly as a means to critique and hence develop existing and new techniques.
background although this is beginning to change, the content of antenatal care has been relatively neglected in safe-motherhood program efforts. this appears in part to be due to an unwarranted belief that interventions over this period have far less impact than those provided around the time of birth. in this par, we review available evidence for 21 interventions potentially deliverable during pregnancy at high coverage to neglected populations in low income countries, with regard to effectiveness in reducing risk of: maternal mortality, newborn mortality, stillbirth, prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction. selection was restricted to interventions that can be provided by non-professional health auxiliaries and not requiring laboratory support. methods in this narrative review, we included relevant cochrane and other systematic reviews and did comprehensive bibliographic searches. inclusion criteria varied by intervention; where available randomized controlled trial evidence was insufficient, observational study evidence was considered. for each intervention we focused on overall contribution to our outcomes of interest, across varying epidemiologies. results in the aggregate, achieving high effective coverage for this set of interventions would very substantially reduce risk for our outcomes of interest and reduce outcome inequities. certain specific interventions, if pushed to high coverage have significant potential impact across many settings. for example, reliable detection of pre-eclampsia followed by timely delivery could prevent up to ¼ of newborn and stillbirth deaths and over 90% of maternal eclampsia/pre-eclampsia deaths. other interventions have potent effects in specific settings: in areas of high p falciparum burden, systematic use of insecticide-treated nets and/or intermittent presumptive therapy in pregnancy could reduce maternal mortality by up to 10%, newborn mortality by up to 20%, and stillbirths by up to 25–30%. behavioral interventions targeting practices at birth and in the hours that follow can have substantial impact in settings where many births happen at home: in such circumstances early initiation of breastfeeding can reduce risk of newborn death by up to 20%; good thermal care practices can reduce mortality risk by a similar order of magnitude. conclusions simple interventions delivered during pregnancy have considerable potential impact on important mortality outcomes. more programmatic effort is warranted to ensure high effective coverage. background and objectives hookworm infection is among the major causes of anaemia in poor communities, but its importance in causing maternal anaemia is poorly understood, and this has hampered effective lobbying for the inclusion of anthelmintic treatment in maternal health packages. we sought to review existing evidence on the role of hookworm as a risk factor for anaemia among pregnant women. we also estimate the number of hookworm infections in pregnant women in sub-saharan africa (ssa). methods structured searches using medline and embase as well as manual searches of reference lists were conducted, and unpublished data were obtained by contacting authors. papers were independently reviewed by two authors, and relevant data were extracted. we compared haemoglobin concentration (hb) according to intensity of hookworm infection and calculated standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. to estimate the number of pregnant women, we used population surfaces and a spatial model of hookworm prevalence. findings one hundred and five reports were screened and 19 were eligible for inclusion: 13 cross-sectional studies, 2 randomised controlled trials, 2 non-randomised treatment trials and 2 observational studies. comparing uninfected women and women lightly (1–1,999 eggs/gram [epg]) infected with hookworm, the standardised mean difference (smd) was −0.24 (95% ci: −0.36 to −0.13). the smd between women heavily (4000+ epg) infected and those lightly infected was −0.57 (95% ci: −0.87 to −0.26). all identified intervention studies showed a benefit of deworming for maternal or child health, but since a variety of outcomes measures were employed, quantitative evaluation was not possible. we estimate that 37.7 million women of reproductive age in ssa are infected with hookworm in 2005 and that approximately 6.9 million pregnant women are infected. conclusions evidence indicates that increasing hookworm infection intensity is associated with lower haemoglobin levels in pregnant women in poor countries. there are insufficient data to quantify the benefits of deworming, and further studies are warranted. given that between a quarter and a third of pregnant women in ssa are infected with hookworm and at risk of preventable hookworm-related anaemia, efforts should be made to increase the coverage of anthelmintic treatment among pregnant women.
background human defensin (hd) 5 and hd6, both paneth cell alpha-defensins, contribute to the antimicrobial barrier against intestinal infection. we have previously demonstrated that levels of both hd5 and hd6 mrna were reduced in adults living in urban zambia, compared with those in adults living in london. the aim of the present study was to determine, during 2 years of follow-up, whether alpha-defensin expression in zambian adults is related to susceptibility to diarrhea.   methods we analyzed intestinal biopsy samples from a longitudinal cohort study conducted in 83 zambian adults by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization, and we measured the incidence of diarrhea.   results levels of hd5 and hd6 mrna in paneth cells varied between participants, over time, and seasonally and were strongly correlated with mucosal architecture. gene expression was almost exclusively restricted to paneth cells. the median (interquartile range) hd5 mrna level was 6.0 (5.6-6.7) log10 transcripts/microg of total rna among 18 participants who experienced diarrhea within 2 months after biopsy-sample collection, compared with 6.8 (6.2-7.3) log10 transcripts/microg of total rna among 94 participants who did not (p=.006). a similar observation was made for hd6.   conclusions these data indicate that intestinal alpha-defensin expression is dynamic and seasonal and suggest that susceptibility to intestinal infection is related to alpha-defensin expression. to determine the response of the small intestinal mucosa to environmental conditions, we studied changes in mucosal architecture and function in a longitudinal cohort study in african adults. over three consecutive years, 238 adults submitted monthly stool samples for parasitologic and bacteriologic analysis and underwent an annual endoscopic jejunal biopsy for mucosal morphometry. absorption and permeability assays were performed on the same day as the enteroscopy. variation in mucosal architecture and function was correlated with environmental factors and stool microbiology. the whole cohort had structural and functional evidence of tropical enteropathy, but structure and function were only weakly correlated. there were marked changes over time, and seasonal variation was observed in villous height (16%), xylose recovery (16%), and permeability (28%). asymptomatic intestinal infections were common. enteropathy was more severe in participants with citrobacter rodentium or hookworm ova in the stool sample taken one month before the investigations were performed.
abstract epicidin 280 is a novel type a lantibiotic produced bystaphylococcus epidermidis bn 280. during c18reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography two epicidin 280 peaks were obtained; the two compounds had molecular masses of 3,133 ± 1.5 and 3,136 ± 1.5 da, comparable antibiotic activities, and identical amino acid compositions. amino acid sequence analysis revealed that epicidin 280 exhibits 75% similarity to pep5. the strains that produce epicidin 280 and pep5 exhibit cross-immunity, indicating that the immunity peptides cross-function in antagonization of both lantibiotics. the complete epicidin 280 gene cluster was cloned and was found to comprise at least five open reading frames (ecii, ecia, ecip,ecib, and ecic, in that order). the proteins encoded by these open reading frames exhibit significant sequence similarity to the biosynthetic proteins of the pep5 operon ofstaphylococcus epidermidis 5. a gene for an abc transporter, which is present in the pep5 gene cluster but is necessary only for high yields (g. bierbaum, m. reis, c. szekat, and h.-g. sahl, appl. environ. microbiol. 60:4332–4338, 1994), was not detected. instead, upstream of the immunity gene ecii we found an open reading frame, ecio, which could code for a novel lantibiotic modification enzyme involved in reduction of an n-terminally located oxopropionyl residue. epicidin 280 produced by the heterologous host staphylococcus carnosus tm 300 after introduction of eciiapbc (i.e., no ecio was present) behaved homogeneously during reverse-phase chromatography. lantibiotics form a group of modified peptides with unique structures, containing post-translationally modified amino acids such as dehydrated and lanthionine residues. in the gram-positive bacteria that secrete these lantibiotics, the gene clusters flanking the structural genes for various linear (type a) lantibiotics have recently been characterized. the best studied representatives are those of nisin (nis), subtilin (spa), epidermin (epi), pep5 (pep), cytolysin (cyl), lactocin s (las) and lacticin 481 (lct). comparison of the lantibiotic gene clusters shows that they contain conserved genes that probably encode similar functions.the nis, spa, epi and pep clusters contain lanb and lanc genes that are presumed to code for two types of enzymes that have been implicated in the modification reactions characteristic of all lantibiotics, i.e. dehydration and thio-ether ring formation. the cyl, las and lct gene clusters have no homologue of the lanb gene, but they do contain a much larger lanm gene that is the lanc gene homologue. most lantibiotic gene clusters contain a lanp gene encoding a serine protease that is presumably involved in the proteolytic processing of the prelantibiotics. all clusters contain a lant gene encoding and abc transporter likely to be involved in the export of (precursors of) the lantibiotics. the lane, lanf and lang genes in the nis, spa and epi clusters encode another transport system that is possibly involved in self-protection. in the nisin and subtilin gene clusters two tandem genes, lanr and lank, have been located that code for a two-component regulatory system.finally, non-homologous genes are found in some lantibiotic gene clusters. the nisl and spal genes encode lipoproteins that are involved in immunity, the pepi gene encodes a membrane-located immunity protein, and epid encodes an enzyme involved in a post-translational modification found only in the c-terminus of epidermin. several genes of unknown function are also found in the las gene cluster.a database has been assembled for all putative gene products of type a lantibiotic gene clusters. database searches, multiple sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction have been used to identify conserved sequence segments in the lanb, lanc, lane, lanf, lang, lank, lanm, lanp, lanr and lant gene products that may be essential for structure and function. this database allows for a rapid screening of newly determined sequences in lantibiotic gene clusters.
author(s): supancic iii, james steven | advisor(s): ramanan, deva k | abstract: cameras can naturally capture sequences of images, or videos, and for computers to understand videos, they must track to connect the past with the present. we focus on two problems which challenge current state-of-the-art trackers. first, we address the challenge of long-term occlusion. for this challenge, a tracker must know when it has lost track and how to reinitialize tracking when the target reappears. we tackle reinitialization by building good appearance models for humans and hands, with a particular emphasis on robustness and occlusion. for the second challenge, appearance variation, the tracker must know when and how to re-learn (or update) an appearance model. common solutions to this challenge encounter the classic problem of drift: aggressively learning putative appearance changes allows small errors to compound, as elements of the background environment pollute the appearance model. we propose two solutions. first, we consider self-paced learning, wherein a tracker begins by learning from frames it finds easy. as the tracker becomes better at recognizing the target, it begins to learn from harder frames. we also develop a data-driven approach in which we train a tracking policy to decide when and how to update an appearance model. to take this direct approach to “learning when to learn”, we exploit large-scale internet data through reinforcement learning. we interpret the resulting policy and conclude with extensions for tracking multiple objects. by solving these tracking challenges, we advance applications in augmented reality, vehicle automation, healthcare, and security. this paper presents a method for acquiring dense nonrigid shape and deformation from a single monocular depth sensor. we focus on modeling the human hand, and assume that a single rough template model is available. we combine and extend existing work on model-based tracking, subdivision surface fitting, and mesh deformation to acquire detailed hand models from as few as 15 frames of depth data. we propose an objective that measures the error of fit between each sampled data point and a continuous model surface defined by a rigged control mesh, and uses as-rigid-as-possible (arap) regularizers to cleanly separate the model and template geometries. a key contribution is our use of a smooth model based on subdivision surfaces that allows simultaneous optimization over both correspondences and model parameters. this avoids the use of iterated closest point (icp) algorithms which often lead to slow convergence. automatic initialization is obtained using a regression forest trained to infer approximate correspondences. experiments show that the resulting meshes model the user's hand shape more accurately than just adapting the shape parameters of the skeleton, and that the retargeted skeleton accurately models the user's articulations. we investigate the effect of various modeling choices, and show the benefits of using subdivision surfaces and arap regularization.
objective: new diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (mci) due to alzheimer's disease (ad) have been developed using biomarkers aiming to establish whether the clinical syndrome is likely due to underlying ad. we investigated the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) biomarkers in predicting progression from amnesic mci to dementia, testing the hypotheses that (1) markers of amyloid and neurodegeneration provide distinct and complementary prognostic information over different time intervals, and that (2) evidence of neurodegeneration in amyloid-negative mci individuals would be useful prognostically. methods: data were obtained from the adni-1 (alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative phase 1) database on all individuals with a baseline diagnosis of mci, baseline mri and csf data, and at least one follow-up visit. mri data were processed using a published set of a priori regions of interest to derive a measure known as the ``ad signature,'' as well as hippocampal volume. the csf biomarkers amyloid-β, total tau, and phospho tau were also examined. we performed logistic regression analyses to identify the best baseline biomarker predictors of progression to dementia over 1 or 3 years, and cox regression models to test the utility of these markers for predicting time-to-dementia. results: for prediction of dementia in mci, the ad signature cortical thickness biomarker performed better than hippocampal volume. although csf tau measures were better than csf amyloid-β at predicting dementia within 1 year, the ad signature was better than all csf measures at prediction over this relatively short-term interval. csf amyloid-β was superior to tau and ad signature at predicting dementia over 3 years. when csf amyloid-β was dichotomized using previously published cutoff values and treated as a categorical variable, a multivariate stepwise cox regression model indicated that both the ad signature mri marker and the categorical csf amyloid-β marker were useful in predicting time-to-event diagnosis of ad dementia. conclusion: in amnesic mci, short-term (1 year) prognosis of progression to dementia relates strongly to baseline markers of neurodegeneration, with the ad signature mri biomarker of cortical thickness performing the best among mri and csf markers studied here. longer-term (3 year) prognosis in these individuals was better predicted by a marker indicative of brain amyloid. prediction of time-to-event in a survival model was predicted by the combination of these biomarkers. these results provide further support for emerging models of the temporal relationship of pathophysiologic events in ad and demonstrate the utility of these biomarkers at the prodromal stage of the illness. in 2010, we put forward a hypothetical model of the major biomarkers of alzheimer's disease (ad). the model was received with interest because we described the temporal evolution of ad biomarkers in relation to each other and to the onset and progression of clinical symptoms. since then, evidence has accumulated that supports the major assumptions of this model. evidence has also appeared that challenges some of our assumptions, which has allowed us to modify our original model. refinements to our model include indexing of individuals by time rather than clinical symptom severity; incorporation of interindividual variability in cognitive impairment associated with progression of ad pathophysiology; modifications of the specific temporal ordering of some biomarkers; and recognition that the two major proteinopathies underlying ad biomarker changes, amyloid β (aβ) and tau, might be initiated independently in sporadic ad, in which we hypothesise that an incident aβ pathophysiology can accelerate antecedent limbic and brainstem tauopathy.
efforts to improve child survival in lower-income countries typically focus on fundamental factors such as economic resources and infrastructure provision, even though research from post-industrial countries confirms that family instability has important health consequences. we tested the association between maternal union instability and children’s mortality risk in africa, latin america and the caribbean, and asia using children’s actual experience of mortality (discrete-time probit hazard models) as well as their experience of untreated morbidity (probit regression). children of divorced/separated mothers experience compromised survival chances, but children of mothers who have never been in a union generally do not. among children of partnered women, those whose mothers have experienced prior union transitions have a higher mortality risk. targeting children of mothers who have experienced union instability—regardless of current union status—may augment ongoing efforts to reduce childhood mortality, especially in africa and latin america where union transitions are common. although children's family lives are diverse, the measurement of children's living arrangements has lagged, focusing on the relationships of children to parents while largely ignoring sibling composition. using data from the 2008 survey of income and program participation (n = 23,985) the authors documented patterns of family complexity among a nationally representative sample of children ages 0-17 living in a range of family structures. they also examined the independent and joint associations of family structure and family complexity on child economic well-being. family complexity was independently related to economic disadvantage, namely, a lower income-to-needs ratio and a higher likelihood of public assistance receipt. the role of family complexity was partially contingent on family structure, with the positive association between family complexity and receipt of public assistance more pronounced for children in families with 2 married biological parents. this study demonstrates the utility of integrating family structure and family complexity in studies of children's well-being.
tissues with the highest rates of proliferation typically exhibit the highest frequencies of apoptosis, but the mechanisms that coordinate these processes are largely unknown. the homeodomain protein gax is down‐regulated when quiescent cells are stimulated to proliferate, and constitutive gax expression inhibits cell proliferation in a p21waf/cip‐dependent manner. to understand how mitogen‐induced proliferation influences the apoptotic process, we investigated the effects of deregulated gax expression on cell viability. forced gax expression induced apoptosis in mitogen‐activated cultures, but quiescent cultures were resistant to cell death. though mitogen activation was required for apoptosis, neither the cdk inhibitor p21waf/cip nor the tumor suppressor p53 was required for gax‐induced cell death. arrest in g1 or s phases of the cell cycle with chemical inhibitors also did not affect apoptosis, further suggesting that gax‐mediated cell death is independent of cell cycle activity. forced gax expression led to bcl‐2 down‐regulation and bax up‐regulation in mitogen‐activated, but not quiescent cultures. mouse embryonic fibroblasts homozygous null for the bax gene were refractive to gax‐induced apoptosis, demonstrating the functional significance of this regulation. these data suggest that the homeostatic balance between cell growth and death can be controlled by mitogen‐dependent pathways that circumvent the cell cycle to alter bcl‐2 family protein expression. the transduction of vascular myocytes with exogenous genetic material will be a common feature of many gene-based therapies for cardiovascular disorders. therefore, the successful application of cardiovascular gene therapy will require a thorough understanding of the molecular biology of the smooth muscle cell. of key importance are the transcriptional regulatory events that coordinate the de-differentiation and proliferation of myocytes in response to vascular injury. the goal of this review is to highlight what is known about the regulators of vascular myocyte transcription that may serve as candidate genes for the development of genetic strategies to manage postinterventional restenosis.
cognitive dysfunction may be a core feature of major depressive disorder, including affective processing bias, abnormal response to negative feedback, changes in decision making, and increased impulsivity. accordingly, a translational medicine paradigm predicts clinical action of novel antidepressants by examining drug-induced changes in affective processing bias. with some exceptions, these concepts have not been systematically applied to preclinical models to test new chemical entities. the purpose of this review is to examine whether an empirically derived behavioral screen for antidepressant drugs may screen for compounds, at least in part, by modulating an impulsive biasing of responding and altered decision making. the differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (drl) 72-second schedule is an operant schedule with a documented fidelity for discriminating antidepressant drugs from nonantidepressant drugs. however, a theoretical basis for this empirical relationship has been lacking. therefore, this review will discuss whether response bias toward impulsive behavior may be a critical screening characteristic of drl behavior requiring long inter-response times to obtain rewards. this review will compare and contrast drl behavior with the five-choice serial reaction time task, a test specifically designed for assessing motoric impulsivity, with respect to psychopharmacological testing and the neural basis of distributed macrocircuits underlying these tasks. this comparison suggests that the existing empirical basis for the drl 72-second schedule as a pharmacological screen for antidepressant drugs is complemented by a novel hypothesis that altering impulsive response bias for rodents trained on this operant schedule is a previously unrecognized theoretical cornerstone for this screening paradigm. rationalen-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (nmdar) antagonists such as ketamine induce cognitive symptoms in man similar to those of schizophrenia and therefore might be useful as models of the disease in animals. however, it is unclear which nmdar antagonist(s) offer the best means to produce cognitive deficits in attention and working memory and to what extent those deficits can be measured selectively in rats.objectivesthe present study systematically compared the effects of eight different nmdar antagonists—mk-801, phencyclidine, (s)-(+)-ketamine, memantine, sdz-220,581, ro 25-6981, cp 101-606 and nvp-aam077—in rats using standard tests of visual attention, the five-choice serial reaction time task (5csrt), and working memory, the delayed matching to position task (dmtp).resultsdrug-induced responses varied qualitatively and quantitatively in both a compound- and a task-dependent manner. effects were generally confounded by concomitant motor and motivational disruption, although individual doses of phencyclidine for example appeared to impair selectively cognitive functions. interestingly, glun2b selective antagonists were unique in their effects; inducing potential performance benefit in the 5csrt.conclusionsoverall, the opportunity to induce a selective cognitive deficit in attention (5csrt) or working memory (dmtp) in the rat is limited by both the nmdar antagonist and the dose range used. the importance of a preclinical focus on ketamine, which is used more frequently in clinical settings, is limited by the extent to which cognitive effects can be both detected and quantified using this exposure regimen within these two operant assays.
primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (ph1) is a rare genetic kidney disease caused by a deficiency of alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (agt). genetic heterogeneity of the agt gene cannot fully account for heterogeneity in the clinical phenotype. this study investigates a possible contribution to the clinical phenotype from snps in ret or pax2 genes associated with reduced nephron number. the frequencies of these snps were compared in ph1-affected dna samples and normal controls, and relative to age of onset in ph1-affected individuals. the frequencies of the risk alleles were higher with early age of onset, although not significantly so. however, homozygosity for the risk alleles of ret and pax2 was not seen in the late onset group. the overall frequencies of risk alleles and the numbers of homozygotes were significantly higher for pax2 in ph1 samples versus controls, suggestive of a bias towards more severe clinical phenotypes in the ph1 samples submitted for analysis. during kidney development, pax2 and pax8 are expressed very early in the mammalian nephric duct and both precede the expression of receptor tyrosine kinase, c-ret. however, in pax2-/- mutant mice, expression of c-ret is lost after embryonic day 10.5. as the ret/gdnf pathway is necessary for renal development and there is a temporal and spatial relationship of pax2 and c-ret expression in the developing genito-urinary system, we postulate that pax2 is necessary for c-ret expression in the developing kidney. in vitro, pax2 protein is capable of physically interacting with a c-ret promoter, and both pax2 and pax8 can activate the expression of a reporter gene driven by the c-ret promoter. compound heterozygous null mice (pax2+/-: ret+/-) display an increased incidence of unilateral and bilateral renal agenesis, and smaller kidneys with fewer nephrons. furthermore, the expression of gdnf is reduced 2-3-fold, whereas c-ret expression is reduced 9-47-fold in pax2 heterozygous embryonic kidneys as detected by real-time quantitative rt (qrt)-pcr. the data demonstrate that pax2 plays an integral role in the initiation and maintenance of the ret/gdnf pathway by not only activating the ligand of the pathway, but by also enhancing the expression of the pathway receptor ret. the effects of reduced pax2 gene dosage are thus amplified resulting in a haploinsufficient phenotype.
obesity and its comorbidities are taking an increasing toll on human health. key pathways that were identified with single gene variants in humans and model organisms have led to improved understanding and treatment of rare cases of human obesity. however, similar progress remains elusive for the more common multifactorial cases of metabolic dysfunction and disease. a survey of mouse chromosome substitution strains (csss) provided insight into the complex genetic control of diet-induced obesity and related conditions. we now report a survey of 60 traits related to obesity and metabolic syndrome in mice with a single substituted chromosome as well as selected traits measured in congenic strains derived from the substituted strain. we found that each strain that was resistant to diet-induced obesity had a distinct phenotype that uniquely modeled different combinations of traits related to metabolic disease. for example, the chromosome 6 css remained insulin resistant in the absence of obesity, demonstrating an atypical relationship between body weight and insulin resistance. these results provide insights into the genetic control of constant components of this mouse model of diet-induced metabolic disease as well as phenotypes that vary depending on genetic background. a better understanding of these genotype-phenotype relationships may enable a more individualized diagnosis and treatment of obesity and the metabolic syndrome. values of insulin-mediated glucose disposal vary continuously throughout a population of apparently healthy persons, and a difference of > or = 600% exists between the most insulin-sensitive and the most insulin-resistant persons. approximately 50% of this variability can be attributed to differences in adiposity (25%) and fitness (25%), with the remaining 50% likely of genetic origin. the more insulin-resistant a person, the more likely that he or she will develop some degree of glucose intolerance, high triacylglycerol and low hdl concentrations, essential hypertension, and procoagulant and proinflammatory states, all of which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd). to identify persons at greater cvd risk because of these abnormalities, the world health organization, the adult treatment panel iii, and the international diabetes federation created a new diagnostic category, the metabolic syndrome. although the components of the 3 versions of the metabolic syndrome are similar, the specific values for those components that define an abnormality are somewhat different, and the manner in which the abnormalities are used to make a positive diagnosis varies dramatically from version to version. this review will summarize the similarities in and differences between the 3 versions of the metabolic syndrome, point out that the clustering of components that make up all 3 definitions of the metabolic syndrome is not accidental and occurs only in insulin-resistant persons, develop the argument that diagnosing the metabolic syndrome in a person has neither pedagogical nor clinical utility, and suggest that the clinical emphasis should be on treating effectively any cvd risk factor that is present.
an in situ perfused rat liver system is useful for studying the hepatic disposition of drugs and their metabolites. however, the effects of the perfusion conditions on drug disposition are unclear. we examined the effects of conditions such as flow rate (13 or 26 ml/min) and bile acid on disposition of diclofenac (df) as a model drug and df metabolites [diclofenac-1-o-acyl glucuronide (df-glu) or 4′-hydroxydiclofenac (df-4′oh)] in the absence of albumin. df, df-glu, and df-4′oh concentrations in the perfusate and cumulative amounts of df-glu excreted in bile were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography methods. df in the perfusate was rapidly eliminated as the perfusate flow rate increased. the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from 0 to 60 min (auc0–60) for df-glu and df-4′oh in a perfusate containing bile acid was lower at a flow rate of 26 and 13 ml/min, respectively. the bile flow rate at 26 ml/min with 24 μm of bile acid in the perfusate was significantly higher (ca. 3.5 times) compared with that at 13 ml/min without bile acid. cumulative biliary df-glu excretion was also dramatically affected by the flow rate and addition of bile acid. this study indicated that the flow rate and bile acid in the perfused rat liver were key factors for bile flow rate and df, df-glu, and df-4′oh disposition in the absence of albumin. the "hepatic arterial buffer response" hypothesis states that the hepatic artery is not controlled by liver parenchymal cell metabolic activity. bile salts stimulate liver metabolism (elevate bile formation) and dilate the hepatic artery. the present data show that the vascular and metabolic effects in cats anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium are independent. low doses of taurocholate (1 microm . min-1 . kg-1) produce metabolic but not vascular responses. at higher doses both the hepatic artery and superior mesenteric artery dilate with equal sensitivity. taurocholate into the portal vein produced elevated bile flow and hepatic arterial dilation; infusion via the hepatic artery resulted in equal metabolic responses but much greater vascular effects. in addition, the time course of onset and termination of the metabolic and vascular responses supports the conclusion that the effects of taurocholic acid on hepatic bile flow and hepatic arterial flow are independent actions. this adds further support for the hepatic arterial buffer response being controlled by factors other than local hepatic metabolic demands.
objectives to compare the proportion of stage i lung cancer and population mortality in china to those in u.s. and europe where lung cancer screening by low-dose computed tomography (ldct) has been already well practiced. methods the proportions of stage i lung cancer in ldct screening population in u.s. and europe were retrieved from nlst and nelson trials. the general proportion of stage i lung cancer in china was retrieved from a rapid meta-analysis, based on a literature search in the china national knowledge infrastructure database. the lung cancer mortality and prevalence of china, u.s. and europe was retrieved from globocan 2012 fact sheet. mortality-to-prevalence ratio (mpr) was applied to compare the population survival outcome of lung cancer. results the estimated proportion of stage i lung cancer in china is merely 20.8% among hospital-based cross-sectional population, with relative ratios (rrs) being 2.40 (95% ci 2.18–2.65) and 2.98 (95% ci 2.62–3.38) compared by ldct-screening population in u.s. and europe trials, respectively. mpr of lung cancer is as high as 58.9% in china, with rrs being 0.46 (95% ci 0.31–0.67) and 0.58 (95% ci 0.39–0.85) compared by u.s. and europe, respectively. conclusions by the epidemiological inference, the ldct mass screening might be associated with increasing stage i lung cancer and therefore improving population survival outcome. how to translate the experiences of lung cancer screening by ldct from developed counties to china in a cost-effective manner needs to be further investigated. background the aggressive and heterogeneous nature of lung cancer has thwarted efforts to reduce mortality from this cancer through the use of screening. the advent of low-dose helical computed tomography (ct) altered the landscape of lung-cancer screening, with studies indicating that low-dose ct detects many tumors at early stages. the national lung screening trial (nlst) was conducted to determine whether screening with low-dose ct could reduce mortality from lung cancer.   methods from august 2002 through april 2004, we enrolled 53,454 persons at high risk for lung cancer at 33 u.s. medical centers. participants were randomly assigned to undergo three annual screenings with either low-dose ct (26,722 participants) or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography (26,732). data were collected on cases of lung cancer and deaths from lung cancer that occurred through december 31, 2009.   results the rate of adherence to screening was more than 90%. the rate of positive screening tests was 24.2% with low-dose ct and 6.9% with radiography over all three rounds. a total of 96.4% of the positive screening results in the low-dose ct group and 94.5% in the radiography group were false positive results. the incidence of lung cancer was 645 cases per 100,000 person-years (1060 cancers) in the low-dose ct group, as compared with 572 cases per 100,000 person-years (941 cancers) in the radiography group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.03 to 1.23). there were 247 deaths from lung cancer per 100,000 person-years in the low-dose ct group and 309 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the radiography group, representing a relative reduction in mortality from lung cancer with low-dose ct screening of 20.0% (95% ci, 6.8 to 26.7; p=0.004). the rate of death from any cause was reduced in the low-dose ct group, as compared with the radiography group, by 6.7% (95% ci, 1.2 to 13.6; p=0.02).   conclusions screening with the use of low-dose ct reduces mortality from lung cancer.

the authors report on the use of a catheter with a cleft for catheterization of a branch artery arising from the aorta with an acute angle. the cleft was created on either the right or cephalad portion at the tip of a seated 4-f shepherd hook catheter in the artery origin, depending on vessel angulation during chemoembolization procedures. this catheter was used in eight arteries-seven inferior phrenic arteries and one right subcostal artery-that could not be catheterized with a conventional coaxial technique. the microcatheter was successfully introduced into all eight vessels through the cleft without complications. purposeto evaluate the incidence of each extrahepatic collateral pathway to hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) and to assess technical success rates and complications of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (tace) through each collateral.methodswe retrospective evaluated extrahepatic collateral pathways to hcc on angiography in 386 procedures on 181 consecutive patients. one hundred and seventy patients had previously undergone tace. tace through extrahepatic collaterals using iodized oil and gelatin sponge particles was performed when a catheter was advanced into the tumor-feeding branch to avoid nontarget embolization.resultsa single collateral was revealed in 275 tace procedures, two were revealed in 74, and three or more were revealed in 34. incidences of collateral source to hcc were 83% from the right inferior phrenic artery (ipa), 24% from the cystic artery, 13% from the omental artery, 12% from the right renal capsular artery (rca) and left ipa, 8% from the right internal mammary artery (ima) and right intercostal artery (ica), and 7% from the right inferior adrenal artery (iaa). technical success rates of tace were 53% in the right ica, 70% in the cystic artery, 74% in the omental artery, 93% in the left ipa, 96% in the right ipa, and 100% in the right rca, right ima, and right iaa. complications included skin necrosis after tace through the right ima (n = 1), cholecystitis after tace through the cystic artery (n = 1), and ulcer formation after tace through the right gastric artery (n = 1), in addition to pleural effusion and basal atelectasis after tace through the ipa and ima.conclusionour study suggests that tace through extrahepatic collaterals is possible with high success rates, and is also relatively safe.
this paper addresses the problem of unsupervised video summarization, formulated as selecting a sparse subset of video frames that optimally represent the input video. our key idea is to learn a deep summarizer network to minimize distance between training videos and a distribution of their summarizations, in an unsupervised way. such a summarizer can then be applied on a new video for estimating its optimal summarization. for learning, we specify a novel generative adversarial framework, consisting of the summarizer and discriminator. the summarizer is the autoencoder long short-term memory network (lstm) aimed at, first, selecting video frames, and then decoding the obtained summarization for reconstructing the input video. the discriminator is another lstm aimed at distinguishing between the original video and its reconstruction from the summarizer. the summarizer lstm is cast as an adversary of the discriminator, i.e., trained so as to maximally confuse the discriminator. this learning is also regularized for sparsity. evaluation on four benchmark datasets, consisting of videos showing diverse events in first-and third-person views, demonstrates our competitive performance in comparison to fully supervised state-of-the-art approaches. we present a novel method for summarizing raw, casually captured videos. the objective is to create a short summary that still conveys the story. it should thus be both, interesting and representative for the input video. previous methods often used simplified assumptions and only optimized for one of these goals. alternatively, they used handdefined objectives that were optimized sequentially by making consecutive hard decisions. this limits their use to a particular setting. instead, we introduce a new method that (i) uses a supervised approach in order to learn the importance of global characteristics of a summary and (ii) jointly optimizes for multiple objectives and thus creates summaries that posses multiple properties of a good summary. experiments on two challenging and very diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where we outperform or match current state-of-the-art.
abstractbackground and purposealthough gait disturbance is an important feature of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (nph), only tentative theories have been offered to explain its pathophysiology. it has been suggested that the mesencephalic locomotor region is the anatomical substrate for the development of the hypokinetic nph gait. to investigate this possibility, we evaluated the correlation between gait disturbance and midbrain diameter.methodswe enrolled 21 patients with nph and 20 age–matched control subjects for the study. the maximal diameter of the midbrain and pons, and the width of the lateral and third ventricles were measured using midsagittal t1–weighted mri and axial t2–weighted mri, respectively. gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and incontinence were semiquantified.resultsthe maximal midbrain diameter was significantly smaller in the nph group than in the controls (14.8 ± 0.9 vs. 17.1 ± 0.7mm, p < 0.001). there were inverse correlations between the midbrain diameter and the widths of the two ventricles (r = –0.562, p = 0.008 for the third ventricle, and r = –0.510, p = 0.018 for the lateral ventricle). the severity of gait disturbance was negatively correlated with the midbrain diameter (r = –0.598, p = 0.004), but the degree of cognitive dysfunction and incontinence showed no significant correlation with midbrain diameter or ventricular width.conclusionsthis study suggests that midbrain atrophy is significantly associated with gait disturbance in nph. we present nine cases of obstructive hydrocephalus (oh) associated with marked parkinsonism. four patients had noncommunicating oh (ncoh) [three nontumoral aqueductal stenosis (as), one tumoral as]. the presentation was that of acute or subacute parkinsonism, usually at the time of acute recurrent ventricular obstruction. three had a marked response to levodopa and required short‐term treatment after shunting. however, one has remained levodopa dependent after 21/2 years. three of the five patients with communicating oh (coh) presented with shunt‐responsive normal pressure hydrocephalus (nph), only later to develop progressive parkinsonism. one of these was found to have progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) at autopsy and psp was clinically susepected in one other patient. a third had an atypical course suggestive of psp; however, autopsy demonstrated the combination of lewy body parkinsonism and the sequelae of hydrocephalus. the remaining two coh patients presented with levodopa‐responsive parkinsonism. subsequent clinical features and imaging studies suggested the presence of nph. the pathophysiology of hydrocephalic parkinsonism probably involves variable sites of dysfunction in the nigrostriatal pathway and/or the cortico‐striato‐pallido‐thalamo‐cortical circuit. at certain locations these pathways lie in close proximity to the ventricular system and may be subjected to mass effects and ischemic changes secondary to ventriculomegaly. the additional importance of possible associations between subcortical cerebral ischemia, nph, and “degenerative” disorders such as psp and parkinson's disease is discussed.
backgroundan organism’s dna sequence is one of the key factors guiding the positioning of nucleosomes within a cell’s nucleus. sequence-dependent bending anisotropy dictates how dna is wrapped around a histone octamer. one of the best established sequence patterns consistent with this anisotropy is the periodic occurrence of at-containing dinucleotides (ww) and gc-containing dinucleotides (ss) in the nucleosomal locations where dna is bent in the minor and major grooves, respectively. although this simple pattern has been observed in nucleosomes across eukaryotic genomes, its use for prediction of nucleosome positioning was not systematically tested.resultswe present a simple computational model, termed the w/s scheme, implementing this pattern, without using any training data. this model accurately predicts the rotational positioning of nucleosomes both in vitro and in vivo, in yeast and human genomes. about 65 – 75% of the experimentally observed nucleosome positions are predicted with the precision of one to two base pairs. the program is freely available at http://people.rit.edu/fxcsbi/ws_scheme/. we also introduce a simple and efficient way to compare the performance of different models predicting the rotational positioning of nucleosomes.conclusionsthis paper presents the w/s scheme to achieve accurate prediction of rotational positioning of nucleosomes, solely based on the sequence-dependent anisotropic bending of nucleosomal dna. this method successfully captures dna features critical for the rotational positioning of nucleosomes, and can be further improved by incorporating additional terms related to the translational positioning of nucleosomes in a species-specific manner. abstract recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the dna sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. although the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal dna has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. based on our evaluations of dna deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions to predict nucleosome positioning. there are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal dna varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of pyrimidine-purine (yr) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g., yyrr versus ryry); (iii) we postulate that alternating at-rich and gc-rich motifs reflect sequence-dependent interactions between histone arginines and dna in the minor groove. using these functions, we analyzed 20 nucleosome positions mapped in vitro at single nucleotide resolution (including clones 601, 603, 605, the pgub plasmid, chicken β-globin and three 5s rdna genes). we predicted 15 of the 20 positions with 1-bp precision, and two positions with 2-bp precision. the predicted position of the ‘601’ nucleosome (i.e., the optimum of the computed score) deviates from the experimentally determined unique position by no more than 1 bp—an accuracy exceeding that of earlier predictions. our analysis reveals a clear heterogeneity of the nucleosomal sequences which can be divided into two groups based on the positioning ‘rules’ they follow. the sequences of one group are enriched by highly deformable yr/yyrr motifs at the minor-groove bending sites shl ±3.5 and ±5.5, which is similar to the α-satellite sequence used in most crystallized nucleosomes. apparently, the positioning of these nucleosomes is determined by the interactions between histones h2a/h2b and the terminal parts of nucleosomal dna. in the other group (that includes the ‘601’ clone) the same yr/yyrr motifs occur predominantly at the sites shl ±1.5. the interaction between the h3/h4 tetramer and the central part of the nucleosomal dna is likely to be responsible for the positioning of nucleosomes of this group, and the dna trajectory in these nucleosomes may differ in detail from the published structures. thus, from the stereochemical perspective, the in vitro nucleosomes studied here follow either an x-ray-like pattern (with strong deformations in the terminal parts of nucleosomal dna), or an alternative pattern (with the deformations occurring predominantly in the central part of the nucleosomal dna). the results presented here may be useful for genome-wide classification of nucleosomes, linking together structural and thermodynamic characteristics of nucleosomes with the underlying dna sequence patterns guiding their positions.
purpose to determine if oral losartan treatment decreases the retinal ganglion cell (rgc) death caused by experimental intraocular pressure (iop) elevation in mice. methods we produced iop increase in cd1 mice and performed unilateral optic nerve crush. mice received oral losartan, spironolactone, enalapril, or no drug to test effects of inhibiting angiotensin receptors. iop was monitored by tonolab, and blood pressure was monitored by tail cuff device. rgc loss was measured in masked axon counts and rgc bodies by β-tubulin labeling. scleral changes that could modulate rgc injury were measured including axial length, scleral thickness, and retinal layer thicknesses, pressure-strain behavior in inflation testing, and study of angiotensin receptors and pathways by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. results losartan treatment prevented significant rgc loss (median loss = 2.5%, p = 0.13), while median loss with water, spironolactone, and enalapril treatments were 26%, 28% and 43%; p < 0.0001). the lower rgc loss with losartan was significantly less than the loss with spironolactone or enalapril (regression model p = 0.001; drug treatment group term p = 0.01). both losartan and enalapril significantly lowered blood pressure (p< 0.001), but losartan was protective, while enalapril led to worse than water-treated rgc loss. rgc loss after crush injury was unaffected by losartan treatment (difference from control p = 0.9). survival of rgc in cell culture was not prolonged by sartan treatment. axonal transport blockade after 3 day iop elevations was less in losartan-treated than in control glaucoma eyes (p = 0.007). losartan inhibited effects of glaucoma, including reduction in extracellular signal-related kinase activity and modification of glaucoma-related changes in scleral thickness and creep under controlled iop. conclusions the neuroprotective effect of losartan in mouse glaucoma is associated with adaptive changes in the sclera expressed at the optic nerve head. accumulation of specific deposits and extracellular molecules under the retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) has been previously observed in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (amd) and may play a role in the pathogenesis of amd. even though age is the major determinant for developing amd, clinical studies have revealed hypertension (htn) as another systemic risk factor. angiotensin ii (ang ii) is considered the most important hormone associated with htn. to evaluate the relationship of ang ii to amd, we studied whether mouse rpe expresses functional ang ii receptor subtypes and whether htn-induced ang ii regulates expression of these receptors as well as critical ecm molecules (mmp-2 and type iv collagen) involved in ecm turnover in rpe. we used 9-month-old c57bl/6 male mice infused with ang ii alone or ang ii in combination with the at1 receptor antagonist candesartan or the at2 receptor antagonist pd123319 for 4 weeks to determine whether htn-associated ang ii was important for ecm regulation in rpe. we found that mouse rpe expressed both ang ii receptor subtypes at the mrna and protein levels. infusion with ang ii induced htn and elevated plasma and ocular ang ii levels. ang ii also regulated at1a and at1b receptor mrna expression, the intracellular concentration of calcium [ca(2+)](i), mmp-2 activity, and type iv collagen accumulation. concurrent administration of ang ii with the at1 receptor blocker prevented the increase in blood pressure and rise in ocular ang ii levels, as well as the calcium and mmp-2 responses. in contrast, the type iv collagen response to ang ii was prevented by blockade of at2 receptors, but not at1 receptors. plasma ang ii levels were not modified by the at1 or at2 receptor blockade. since the effects of ang ii on mmp-2 and type iv collagen require inhibition of both ang ii receptor subtypes, these receptors may play a role as a potential therapeutic targets to prevent ecm turnover dysregulation in the rpe basement membrane, suggesting a pathogenic mechanism to explain the link between htn and amd.
ribosome biogenesis is critical in the growth of eukaryotic cells, in which the synthesis of precursor ribosomal rna is the first and rate-limiting step. here, we show that human pih1 domain-containing protein 1 (pih1) interacts directly with histone h4 and recruits the brg1-swi/snf complex via snf5 to human rrna genes. this process is likely involved in pih1-dependent dnase i-hypersensitive chromatin remodeling at the core promoter of the rrna genes. pih1 mediates the occupancy of not only the brg1 complex but also the pol i complex at the core promoter and enhances transcription initiation of rrna genes. additionally, the interaction between pih1 and h4k16 expels tip5, a component of the silencing nucleolar remodeling complex (norc), from the core region, suggesting that pih1 is involved in the derepression of norc-silenced rrna genes. these data indicate that pih1 is a positive regulator of human rrna genes and is of great importance for the recovery of human cells from nutrient starvation and the transition to glucose-induced exponential growth in vivo. the snf2h-containing chromatin-remodeling complex norc is responsible for silencing a fraction of mammalian rrna genes (rdna). norc silences transcription by establishing heterochromatic features-including dna methylation, hypoacetylation of histone h4, and methylation of h3k9-at the rdna promoter []. we have investigated the mechanism of norc-mediated rdna silencing and show that binding of the bromodomain of tip5, the large subunit of norc, to acetylated nucleosomes is a prerequisite for norc function. a point mutation within the bromodomain impairs the association of norc with chromatin, prevents heterochromatin formation, and abolishes transcriptional repression. moreover, the association of norc with chromatin requires acetylation of histone h4 at lysine 16 (ach4k16), and binding to ach4k16 is required for subsequent deacetylation of h4k5, h4k8, and h4k12, indicating that acetylation of h4k16 plays an active role in norc-mediated heterochromatin formation. the bromodomain cooperates with an adjacent phd finger to recruit hdac1, dnmt1, dnmt3, and snf2h to rdna. if specifically targeted to the rdna promoter, the phd finger/bromodomain is capable of establishing heterochromatic features and rdna silencing. thus, the phd finger/bromodomain represents an autonomous unit that binds to ach4k16 and coordinates the chain of events that establish the repressed state of rdna.
the current statement is a systematic review of the available data concerning the efficacy of medication treatment of bipolar disorder (bp). a systematic medline search was made concerning the treatment of bp (rcts) with the names of treatment options as keywords. the search was updated on 10 march 2012. the literature suggests that lithium, first and second generation antipsychotics and valproate and carbamazepine are efficacious in the treatment of acute mania. quetiapine and the olanzapine–fluoxetine combination are also efficacious for treating bipolar depression. antidepressants should only be used in combination with an antimanic agent, because they can induce switching to mania/hypomania/mixed states/rapid cycling when utilized as monotherapy. lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine and aripiprazole are efficacious during the maintenance phase. lamotrigine is efficacious in the prevention of depression, and it remains to be clarified whether it is also efficacious for mania. there is some evidence on the efficacy of psychosocial interventions as an adjunctive treatment to medication. electroconvulsive therapy is an option for refractory patients. in acute manic patients who are partial responders to lithium/valproate/carbamazepine, adding an antipsychotic is a reasonable choice. the combination with best data in acute bipolar depression is lithium plus lamotrigine. patients stabilized on combination treatment might do worse if shifted to monotherapy during maintenance, and patients could benefit with add-on treatment with olanzapine, valproate, an antidepressant, or lamotrigine, depending on the index acute phase. a variety of treatment options for bp are available today, but still unmet needs are huge. combination therapy may improve the treatment outcome but it also carries more side-effect burden. further research is necessary as well as the development of better guidelines and algorithms for the step-by-step rational treatment. objective in a naturalistic follow-up of adult bipolar patients, the authors examined the contributions of demographic, phenomenological, and clinical variables, including antidepressant use, to prospectively observed mood episode frequency.   method for 1,742 bipolar i and ii patients in the systematic treatment enhancement program for bipolar disorder (step-bd), episodes of mood disorders were evaluated for up to 1 year of treatment.   results at entry, 32% of the patients met the dsm-iv criteria for rapid cycling in the prestudy year. of the 1,742 patients, 551 (32%) did not complete 1 year of treatment. among the 1,191 patients remaining, those with prior rapid cycling (n=356) were more likely to have further recurrences, although not necessarily more than four episodes per year. at the end of 12 months, only 5% (n=58) of the patients could be classified as rapid cyclers; 34% (n=409) had no further mood episodes, 34% (n=402) experienced one episode, and 27% (n=322) had two or three episodes. patients who entered the study with earlier illness onset and greater severity were more likely to have one or more episodes in the prospective study year. antidepressant use during follow-up was associated with more frequent mood episodes.   conclusions while dsm-iv rapid cycling was prospectively observed in only a small percentage of patients, the majority of these patients had continued recurrences at lower but clinically significant rates. this suggests that cycling is on a continuum and that prevention of recurrences may require early intervention and restricted use of antidepressants.
peptidergic neurons are a group of neuronal cells that synthesize and secrete peptides to regulate a variety of biological processes. to identify genes controlling the development and function of peptidergic neurons, we conducted a screen of 545 splice-trap lines and identified 28 loci that drove expression in peptidergic neurons when crossed to a gfp reporter transgene. among these lines, an insertion in the alan shepard (shep) gene drove expression specifically in most peptidergic neurons. shep transcripts and shep proteins were detected primarily and broadly in the central nervous system (cns) in embryos, and this expression continued into the adult stage. loss of shep resulted in late pupal lethality, reduced adult life span, wing expansion defects, uncoordinated adult locomotor activities, rejection of males by virgin females, and reduced neuropil area and reduced levels of multiple presynaptic markers throughout the adult cns. examination of the bursicon neurons in shep mutant pharate adults revealed smaller somata and fewer axonal branches and boutons, and all of these cellular phenotypes were fully rescued by expression of the most abundant wild-type shep isoform. in contrast to shep mutant animals at the pharate adult stage, shep mutant larvae displayed normal bursicon neuron morphologies. similarly, shep mutant adults were uncoordinated and weak, while shep mutant larvae displayed largely, although not entirely, normal locomotor behavior. thus, shep played an important role in the metamorphic development of many neurons. abstract the basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) protein dimmed (dimm) supports the differentiation of secretory properties in numerous peptidergic cells of drosophila melanogaster. dimm is coexpressed with diverse amidated neuropeptides and with the amidating enzyme peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (phm) in approximately 300 cells of the late embryo. here we confirm that dimm has transcription factor activity in transfected hek 293 cells and that the phm gene is a direct target. the mammalian dimm orthologue mist1 also transactivated the phm gene. dimm activity was dependent on the basic region of the protein and on the sequences of three e-box sites within phm's first intron; the sites make different contributions to the total activity. these data suggest a model whereby the three e boxes interact cooperatively and independently to produce high phm transcriptional activation. this dimm-controlled phm regulatory region displayed similar properties in vivo. spatially, its expression mirrored that of the dimm protein, and its activity was largely dependent on dimm. further, in vivo expression was highly dependent on the sequences of the same three e boxes. this study supports the hypothesis that dimm is a master regulator of a peptidergic cell fate in drosophila and provides a detailed transcriptional mechanism of dimm action on a defined target gene.
perfluorooctane sulfonate (pfos) is a globally distributed persistent organic pollutant that has been found to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in aquatic food webs. although principally in its linear isomeric configuration, 21-35% of the pfos manufactured via electrochemical fluorination is produced as a branched structural isomer. pfos isomer patterns were investigated in multiple tissues of polar bears (ursus maritimus) from east greenland. the liver (n = 9), blood (n = 19), brain (n = 16), muscle (n = 5), and adipose (n = 5) were analyzed for linear pfos (n-pfos), as well as multiple mono- and di-trifluoromethyl-substituted branched isomers. n-pfos accounted for 93.0 ± 0.5% of σ-pfos isomer concentrations in the liver, whereas the proportion was significantly lower (p<0.05) in the blood (85.4 ± 0.5%). branched isomers were quantifiable in the liver and blood, but not in the brain, muscle, or adipose. in both the liver and blood, 6-perfluoromethylheptane sulfonate (p6mhps) was the dominant branched isomer (2.61 ± 0.10%, and 3.26 ± 0.13% of σ-pfos concentrations, respectively). no di-trifluoromethyl-substituted isomers were detectable in any of the tissues analyzed. these tissue-specific isomer patterns suggest isomer-specific pharmacokinetics, perhaps due to differences in protein affinities, and thus differences in protein interactions, as well transport, absorption, and/or metabolism in the body. long-term temporal trends (1991-2008) and spatial differences of perfluoroalkylated substances (pfass) were investigated in harbor porpoise (phocoena phocoena) liver samples of juvenile females from the baltic and north sea. additionally, spatial differences between the populations in the baltic sea and atlantic ocean (i.e. iceland and norway) and the influence of the body mass, age and sex on the pfas concentrations were examined. perfluorooctane sulfonate (pfos) was the predominant compound with a concentration range of 160-2425 ng/g wet weight (ww), followed by perfluorooctane sulfonamide (pfosa, 1-237 ng/g ww) and perfluoroundecanoate (pfuna, 3-124 ng/g ww). in terms of temporal trends, perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (pfsas) and pfosa concentrations decreased over time, while, conversely, the c(9)-c(13) perfluoroalkyl carboxylate (pfca) concentrations increased. spatial distribution of the contaminant concentrations showed consistently higher concentrations in the baltic sea and lowest concentrations in the icelandic population of the atlantic ocean.
analysis of the genome of the human pathogen, aspergillus fumigatus, revealed the presence of several putative glutathione transferase (gst) open reading frames. three a. fumigatus gst genes, termed gsta, b, and c, were cloned and recombinant proteins expressed in escherichia coli. functional analysis of recombinant gsta-c confirms that the enzymes exhibit gst activity and glutathione peroxidase activity. rt-pcr confirmed low basal expression of gsta and gstc which was markedly up-regulated (at least 4x-10x) in the presence of either h2o2 or 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (cdnb). gstb expression was only observed in the presence of cdnb. these results demonstrate for the first time the existence of three functional gsts in a. fumigatus and strongly suggest a role for these enzymes in the response of the organism to both oxidative stress and xenobiotic presence. the glutathione s-transferases (gst) represent a major group of detoxification enzymes. all eukaryotic species possess multiple cytosolic and membrane-bound gst isoenzymes, each of which displays distinct catalytic as well as noncatalytic binding properties: the cytosolic enzymes are encoded by at least five distantly related gene families (designated class alpha, mu, pi, sigma, and theta gst), whereas the membrane-bound enzymes, microsomal gst and leukotriene c4 synthetase, are encoded by single genes and both have arisen separately from the soluble gst. evidence suggests that the level of expression of gst is a crucial factor in determining the sensitivity of cells to a broad spectrum of toxic chemicals. in this article the biochemical functions of gst are described to show how individual isoenzymes contribute to resistance to carcinogens, antitumor drugs, environmental pollutants, and products of oxidative stress. a description of the mechanisms of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gst isoenzymes is provided to allow identification of factors that may modulate resistance to specific noxious chemicals. the most abundant mammalian gst are the class alpha, mu, and pi enzymes and their regulation has been studied in detail. the biological control of these families is complex as they exhibit sex-, age-, tissue-, species-, and tumor-specific patterns of expression. in addition, gst are regulated by a structurally diverse range of xenobiotics and, to date, at least 100 chemicals have been identified that induce gst; a significant number of these chemical inducers occur naturally and, as they are found as nonnutrient components in vegetables and citrus fruits, it is apparent that humans are likely to be exposed regularly to such compounds. many inducers, but not all, effect transcriptional activation of gst genes through either the antioxidant-responsive element (are), the xenobiotic-responsive element (xre), the gst p enhancer 1(gpe), or the glucocorticoid-responsive element (gre). barbiturates may transcriptionally activate gst through a barbie box element. the involvement of the ah-receptor, maf, nrl, jun, fos, and nf-kappa b in gst induction is discussed. many of the compounds that induce gst are themselves substrates for these enzymes, or are metabolized (by cytochrome p-450 monooxygenases) to compounds that can serve as gst substrates, suggesting that gst induction represents part of an adaptive response mechanism to chemical stress caused by electrophiles. it also appears probable that gst are regulated in vivo by reactive oxygen species (ros), because not only are some of the most potent inducers capable of generating free radicals by redox-cycling, but h2o2 has been shown to induce gst in plant and mammalian cells: induction of gst by ros would appear to represent an adaptive response as these enzymes detoxify some of the toxic carbonyl-, peroxide-, and epoxide-containing metabolites produced within the cell by oxidative stress. class alpha, mu, and pi gst isoenzymes are overexpressed in rat hepatic preneoplastic nodules and the increased levels of these enzymes are believed to contribute to the multidrug-resistant phenotype observed in these lesions. the majority of human tumors and human tumor cell lines express significant amounts of class pi gst. cell lines selected in vitro for resistance to anticancer drugs frequently overexpress class pi gst, although overexpression of class alpha and mu isoenzymes is also often observed. the mechanisms responsible for overexpression of gst include transcriptional activation, stabilization of either mrna or protein, and gene amplification. in humans, marked interindividual differences exist in the expression of class alpha, mu, and theta gst. the molecular basis for the variation in class alpha gst is not known.

transcription factors contribute to the differentiation of cortical neurons, orchestrate specific interneuronal circuits, and define synaptic relationships. we have investigated neurons expressing chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor ii (coup-tfii), which plays a role in the migration of gabaergic neurons. whole-cell, patch-clamp recording in vitro combined with colocalization of molecular cell markers in the adult cortex differentiates distinct interneurons. the majority of strongly coup-tfii-expressing neurons were in layers i–iii. most calretinin (cr) and/or cholecystokinin- (cck) and/or reelin-positive interneurons were also coup-tfii-positive. cr-, cck-, or reelin-positive neurons formed 80%, 20%, or 17% of coup-tfii-positive interneurons, respectively. about half of coup-tfii-/cck-positive interneurons were cr-positive, a quarter of them reelin-positive, but none expressed both. interneurons positive for coup-tfii fired irregular, accommodating and adapting trains of action potentials (aps) and innervated mostly small dendritic shafts and rarely spines or somata. paired recording showed that a calretinin-/coup-tfii-positive interneuron elicited inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (ipsps) in a reciprocally connected pyramidal cell. calbindin, somatostatin, or parvalbumin-immunoreactive interneurons and most pyramidal cells express no immunohistochemically detectable coup-tfii. in layers v and vi, some pyramidal cells expressed a low level of coup-tfii in the nucleus. in conclusion, coup-tfii is expressed in a diverse subset of gabaergic interneurons predominantly innervating small dendritic shafts originating from both interneurons and pyramidal cells. while the cortical interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (mge) migrate rather diffusely into the cortex, interneurons that migrate out from the caudal ganglionic eminence (cge) mainly move caudally into the caudal cerebral cortex and the hippocampus in the form of the caudal migratory stream (cms) (yozu et al., 2005). although transplantation experiments at embryonic day 13.5 had revealed that the migrating cells in these two populations are already intrinsically different in regard to their ability to respond to the cge environment (yozu et al., 2005), it is not known how the cge cells are specified and how their migratory behavior is determined. in this study we showed that, although cge and lateral ganglionic eminence (lge) express almost the same marker molecules, lge cells do not migrate caudally when transplanted into the cge, suggesting that lge cells are intrinsically different from cge cells. we therefore compared the transcriptomes of the cge, mge, and lge, and the results showed that coup-tfii was expressed preferentially in the cge as well as in the migrating interneurons in the cms. transplantation experiments revealed that coup-tfii is sufficient to change the direction of mge cell migration to caudal when transplanted into the cge environment, and knockdown of coup-tfii inhibited the caudal migration of the cge cells. these results suggest that coup-tfii is both required and sufficient for the cge-cell-specific migratory behavior in the caudal direction. thus, a locally expressed transcription factor determines the migratory direction of the cortical interneurons in a region-specific manner.
protein interactions are an important resource to obtain an understanding of cell function. recently, researchers have compared networks of interactions in order to understand network evolution. while current methods first infer homologs and then compare topologies, we here present a method which first searches for interesting topologies and then looks for homologs. pina (protein interaction network analysis) takes the protein interaction networks of two organisms, scans both networks for subnetworks deemed interesting, and then tries to find orthologs among the interesting subnetworks. the application is very fast because orthology investigations are restricted to subnetworks like hubs and clusters that fulfill certain criteria regarding neighborhood and connectivity. finally, the hubs or clusters found to be related can be visualized and analyzed according to protein annotation. y‐family dna polymerases can replicate past a variety of damaged bases in vitro but, with the exception of dna polymerase η (polη), which is defective in xeroderma pigmentosum variants, there is little information on the functions of these polymerases in vivo. here, we show that dna polymerase ι (polι), like polη, associates with the replication machinery and accumulates at stalled replication forks following dna‐damaging treatment. we show that polη and polι foci form with identical kinetics and spatial distributions, suggesting that localization of these two polymerases is tightly co‐ordinated within the nucleus. furthermore, localization of polι in replication foci is largely dependent on the presence of polη. using several different approaches, we demonstrate that polη and polι interact with each other physically and that the c‐terminal 224 amino acids of polι are sufficient for both the interaction with polη and accumulation in replication foci. our results provide strong evidence that polη targets polι to the replication machinery, where it may play a general role in maintaining genome integrity as well as participating in translesion dna synthesis.

in this paper, we study the hop-count properties of one-dimensional wireless ad-hoc networks, where the nodes are placed independently and identically according to a poisson distribution with an arbitrary density function. we derive exact equations to calculate the probability mass function of two hop-count random variables: the number of hops needed for a node located at an arbitrary location in the network to receive a message from a node located at one end of the linear network, and the number of hops needed for a node located at one end of the network to receive a message from a node at an arbitrary location. based on the derived formulas, we then propose localization and location verification methods. through simulations, we show that our proposed localization method not only has a competitive performance for a range-free method, but also outperforms range-based methods with a local distance measurement error of 10% or more. furthermore, the proposed location verification protocol is shown to have better results compared to the existing verification systems that also use the hop-count information. an important feature of our methods is that they are applicable to arbitrary densities. this is unlike the existing methods that are limited only to the case of uniform node densities. using simulations, we also evaluate the proposed schemes in the presence of rician fading and show that their performance is rather robust with respect to the change in the fading parameter. moreover, the hop-count equations derived in this work can be used in analyzing other aspects of broadcasting protocols such as quality of service and delay. security plays an important role in the ability to deploy and retrieve trustworthy data from a wireless sensor network. location verification is an effective defense against attacks which take advantage of a lack, or compromise, of location information. in this work, a secure probabilistic location verification method for randomly deployed dense sensor networks is proposed. the proposed probabilistic location verification (plv) algorithm leverages the probabilistic dependence of the number of hops a broadcast packet traverses to reach a destination and the euclidean distance between the source and the destination. a small number of verifier nodes are used to determine the plausibility of the claimed location, which is represented by a real number between zero and one. using the calculated plausibility metric, it is possible to create arbitrary number of trust levels in the location claimed. simulation studies verify that the proposed solution provides high performance in face of various types of attacks.

cancer has been identified as the leading cause of death. it is predicted that around 20–26 million people will be diagnosed with cancer by 2020. with this alarming rate, there is an urgent need for a more effective methodology to understand, prevent and cure cancer. microarray technology provides a useful basis of achieving this goal, with cluster analysis of gene expression data leading to the discrimination of patients, identification of possible tumor subtypes and individualized treatment. amongst clustering techniques, k-means is normally chosen for its simplicity and efficiency. however, it does not account for the different importance of data attributes. this paper presents a new locally weighted extension of k-means, which has proven more accurate across many published datasets than the original and other extensions found in the literature. motivation it is far from trivial to select the most effective clustering method and its parameterization, for a particular set of gene expression data, because there are a very large number of possibilities. although many researchers still prefer to use hierarchical clustering in one form or another, this is often sub-optimal. cluster ensemble research solves this problem by automatically combining multiple data partitions from different clusterings to improve both the robustness and quality of the clustering result. however, many existing ensemble techniques use an association matrix to summarize sample-cluster co-occurrence statistics, and relations within an ensemble are encapsulated only at coarse level, while those existing among clusters are completely neglected. discovering these missing associations may greatly extend the capability of the ensemble methodology for microarray data clustering.   results the link-based cluster ensemble (lce) method, presented here, implements these ideas and demonstrates outstanding performance. experiment results on real gene expression and synthetic datasets indicate that lce: (i) usually outperforms the existing cluster ensemble algorithms in individual tests and, overall, is clearly class-leading; (ii) generates excellent, robust performance across different types of data, especially with the presence of noise and imbalanced data clusters; (iii) provides a high-level data matrix that is applicable to many numerical clustering techniques; and (iv) is computationally efficient for large datasets and gene clustering.   availability online supplementary and implementation are available at: http://users.aber.ac.uk/nii07/bioinformatics2010.   supplementary information supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.
latex fractions from calotropis procera, cryptostegia grandiflora, plumeria rubra, and himatanthus drasticus were assayed in order to prospect for new plant peptidases with milk-clotting activities, for use as rennet alternatives. only c. procera and c. grandiflora latex fractions exhibited proteolytic and milk-clotting activities, which were not affected by high concentrations of nacl and cacl2. however, pre-incubation of both samples at 75°c for 10min eliminated completely their activities. both proteolytic fractions were able to hydrolyze k-casein and to produce peptides of 16kda, a similar sds-page profile to commercial chymosin. rp-hplc and mass spectrometry analyses of the k-casein peptides showed that the peptidases from c. procera or c. grandiflora hydrolyzed k-casein similar to commercial chymosin. the cheeses made with both latex peptidases exhibited yields, dry masses, and soluble proteins similar to cheeses prepared with commercial chymosin. in conclusion, c. procera and c. grandiflora latex peptidases with the ability to coagulate milk can be used as alternatives to commercial animal chymosin in the cheese manufacturing process. latex proteins have drawn attention because they have shown several pharmacological activities. herein, the fibrin(ogen)olytic activity of cryptostegia grandiflora (cglp) and plumeria rubra (prlp) latices were evaluated and characterized. ion-exchange chromatography separated cglp in proteolytic (cglp pi) and nonproteolytic proteins (cglp pii). cglp and cglp pi hydrolyzed azocasein in a dose-dependent manner, whereas cglp pii and prlp showed negligible activities. cglp and cglp pi accelerated plasmatic clot formation and digested all fibrinogen chains in a time/dose-dependent manner, though in a nonspecific way. cglp and cglp pi did not fully hydrolyze the subunits of the fibrin clot since fibrin &agr;-chain showed resistance to proteolysis. no fibrinogenolytic activity was noticed after incubation of cglp and cglp pi with e-64. these results suggested that fibrinogenolytic and procoagulant activities of c. grandiflora were performed by cysteine proteases and confirm the activity of latex cysteine proteases as thrombin and plasmin-like proteins.
dentin possesses unique hierarchical structure, which has a significant influence on the mechanical properties. understanding the relationship between structure and mechanical properties of dentin is essential for preventing and curing oral diseases, as well as, potentially for developing man-made engineering materials with superior mechanical performance. in this study, the effect of the two-layered structure, where hard peritubular dentin (ptd) containing dentin tubules are embedded in soft intertubular dentin (itd), on the fracture behavior of dentin is investigated. a numerical model is developed, in which ptd cracking, itd cracking and the debonding of the interface between ptd and itd are all taken into account. numerical simulations reveal that ptd fracture and interface debonding are the major failure mechanisms, which are consistent with experimental observation. it is identified that the cohesive strength and critical separation of interface are the key parameters controlling which of the mechanisms is active. the low cohesive strength of interface and small critical separation of interface can lead to interface debonding, while the large cohesive strength and critical separation give rise to ptd fracture. in addition, it is found that large volume fraction of dentin tubules and small volume fraction of ptd can enhance the toughness of dentin, which provides a new insight into the degraded mechanical properties of old dentin. a methodology to determine the constitutive parameters for the simulation of progressive delamination is proposed. the procedure accounts for the size of a cohesive finite element and the length of the cohesive zone to ensure the correct dissipation of energy. in addition, a closed-form expression for estimating the minimum penalty stiffness necessary for the constitutive equation of a cohesive finite element is presented. it is shown that the resulting constitutive law allows the use of coarser finite element meshes than is usually admissible, which renders the analysis of large-scale progressive delamination problems computationally tractable.
genes crucial for cancer development can be mutated via various mechanisms, which may reflect the nature of the mutagen. in thyroid papillary carcinomas, mutations of genes coding for effectors along the mapk pathway are central for transformation. braf point mutation is most common in sporadic tumors. by contrast, radiation-induced tumors are associated with paracentric inversions activating the receptor tyrosine kinases ret and ntrk1. we report here a rearrangement of braf via paracentric inversion of chromosome 7q resulting in an in-frame fusion between exons 1-8 of the akap9 gene and exons 9-18 of braf. the fusion protein contains the protein kinase domain and lacks the autoinhibitory n-terminal portion of braf. it has elevated kinase activity and transforms nih3t3 cells, which provides evidence, for the first time to our knowledge, of in vivo activation of an intracellular effector along the mapk pathway by recombination. the akap9-braf fusion was preferentially found in radiation-induced papillary carcinomas developing after a short latency, whereas braf point mutations were absent in this group. these data indicate that in thyroid cancer, radiation activates components of the mapk pathway primarily through chromosomal paracentric inversions, whereas in sporadic forms of the disease, effectors along the same pathway are activated predominantly by point mutations. the ntrk1 gene in the q arm of chromosome i encodes one of the receptors for the nerve growth factor and is frequently activated as an oncogene in papillary thyroid carcinomas. the activation is due to chromosomal rearrangements juxtaposing the ntrk1 tyrosine kinase domain to 5′‐end sequences from different genes. the thyroid trk oncogenes are activated by recombination with at least three different genes: the gene coding for tropomyosin and tpr, both on chromosome i, and tfg on chromosome 3. in a previous study, we showed that two tumors carrying the tpr/ntrk1 rearrangement contained structurally different oncogenes named trk‐t1 and trk‐t2. in this paper, we report (1) the cdna structure of trk‐t2. (2) evidence that trk‐t2 is generated by different rearrangements in two thyroid tumors, and (3) a detailed analysis of the three different tpr/ntrk1 rearrangements. with molecular studies based on southern blot hybridization, cloning, and sequencing, we show that all the rearrangements are nearly balanced, involving deletion, insertion, or duplication of only few nucleotides. in one case, an additional rearrangement involving sequences derived from chromosome 17 was detected. genes chromosom. cancer 19:112–123, 1997. © 1997 wiley‐liss, inc.
aa amyloidosis, or secondary amyloidosis, is a rare but serious complication of chronic inflammatory diseases. chronic inflammatory arthritis is the commonest cause of aa amyloidosis and, when the latter appears, treatment can be frustrating. deposition of fibrils, derived from circulating acute-phase reactant serum amyloid a protein (saa), in the kidneys can lead to proteinuria and progressive loss of renal function. we describe the case of a 14-year-old female with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis who developed nephrotic syndrome secondary to aa amyloidosis; while she was unresponsive to all measures, including anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy, treatment with tocilizumab, an anti-human interleukin-6 receptor antibody, immediately normalized the saa and reversed the nephrotic syndrome. we discuss this new therapeutic approach. constitutively overproduced in proliferating synovial tissues, interleukin-6 (il-6) is deeply involved in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (ra). tocilizumab is a humanized anti-human il-6 receptor antibody that binds to soluble and membrane-bound il-6 receptor, and at detectable levels in blood, tocilizumab is capable of almost completely blocking the transmembrane signaling of il-6. in clinical trials for patients with ra in japan, tocilizumab monotherapy has shown clinical efficacy equaling that of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) inhibitor in combination with methotrexate, and in an extension study in patients who responded to tocilizumab, almost no patients showed a decrease in the efficacy of tocilizumab. evidence obtained in a phase iii study in japan demonstrated that tocilizumab monotherapy had a sig-nificant inhibitory effect on the progression of structural joint damage compared with that of conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmards). furthermore it has been shown that tocilizumab has an excellent ability to suppress serum amyloid a levels and could therefore be an important therapeutic strategy in amyloid a amyloidosis secondary to rheumatic diseases. the safety profile of tocilizumab appears to be satisfactory. however, several serious infections were also reported, and careful monitoring is therefore important during use.
myxobolus prochilodus and myxobolus porofilus are parasites of prochilodus lineatus, an economically important south american fish found in la plata and paraiba do sul river basins. this study focusing on parasite-host interaction provides an ultrastructural and phylogenetic analysis, the latter based on ssrdna sequencing of these parasites respectively infecting the gill filaments and fins of p. lineatus taken from the mogi guaçu river, são paulo, brazil. a total of 13 adult specimens were examined in this study. the prevalence of infection was 7.69 % for m. prochilodus and 15.38 % for m. porofilus. phylogenetic analysis showed m. prochilodus and m. porofilus clustered in a subclade composed of parasites of the prochilodontidae family. in m. prochilodus infecting gill filaments, where cellular degeneration in the epithelium was observed, the plasmodia were surrounded by a capsule composed of layers of fibrocyte-like cells, with cellular projections joined to the projections of other fibrocyte-like cells by desmosomes, and more externally typical fibroblast layers. some granular leukocytes were seen interspersed among these layers. in m. porofilus infecting the fins, the capsule of connective tissue was represented only by loosely arranged collagen fibers, and no granular leucocytes were observed. finally, several unusual vacuoles with filamentous content and some characteristics usually described as degenerative alterations, as myelin figure, were noted in plasmodia and pansporoblasts of both myxosporean species. the possible influence of inflammatory response and xenobiotics was considered to be the explanation for the alterations observed in myxobolus species and its host. myxozoans are among the most abundant parasites in nature. their life cycles involve two hosts: an invertebrate, usually an annelid, and a vertebrate, usually a fish. they affect fish species in their natural habitats but also constitute a menace for fish aquaculture. using different strategies they are able to parasitize and cause damage in multiple organs, including mucosal tissues, which they use also as portals of entry. in fish, the main mucosal sites include the intestine, skin and gills. recently the finding of a specific mucosal immunoglobulin in teleost (igt), analogous to mammalian iga, and the capacity of fish to develop a specific mucosal immune response against different pathogens, has highlighted the importance of studying immune responses at mucosal sites. in this review, we describe the major biological characteristics of myxozoan parasites and present the data available regarding immune responses for species that infect mucosal sites. as models for mucosal immunity we review the responses to enteromyxum spp. and ceratomyxa shasta, both of which parasitize the intestine. the immune response at the skin and gills is also described, as these mucosal tissues are used by myxozoans as attaching surfaces and portal of entry, and some species also parasitize these sites. finally, the development of immunoprophylactic strategies is discussed.
we have fabricated highly luminescent samples with erbium-doped amorphous silicon suboxide <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="tex">$(a\hbox{-sio}_{x} \langle \hbox{er}\rangle)$</tex></formula> layers on <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="tex">$\hbox{sio}_{2}/\hbox{si}$</tex></formula> substrates. the layers are designed to provide a resonance with large modal overlap with the active material and with low quality factor (q-factor) at 1540 nm. also, the structure has higher q-factor resonances in the wavelength range between 800 and 1000 nm. within this range, strong light emission from <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="tex">$a\hbox{-sio}_{x}$</tex></formula> defect-related radiative centers and emission from the <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="tex">$\hbox{er}^{3+}\,{}^{4}{ \rm i}_{11/2} - ^{4}{\rm i}_{15/2}$</tex></formula> optical transition (980 nm) are observed. a twofold and fourfold improvement in photoluminescence (pl) intensity are achieved in the wavelength ranges between 800 and 1000 nm and between 1500 and 1600 nm (region of <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="tex">$\hbox{er}^{3+}\,{}^{4}{\rm i}_{13/2} - {}^{4}{\rm i}_{15/2}$</tex></formula> transition), respectively, when compared to the <formula formulatype="inline"> <tex notation="tex">$a\hbox{-sio}_{x} \langle \hbox{er} \rangle$</tex></formula> active material deposited directly on si substrate. the latter higher pl intensity enhancement is apparently caused by optical pumping at 980 nm (higher q-factor) with subsequent emission from the <formula formulatype="inline"><tex notation="tex">${}^{4}{\rm i}_{15/2}$</tex></formula> level in the low q-factor resonance at 1540 nm. further, five times increase of this emission at 1540 nm is obtained after optimized temperature annealing. the temperature-induced quenching in the pl intensity indicates distinct deactivation energies related to different types of er centers which are more or less coupled to defects depending on the thermal treatment temperature we present a novel method for maximizing signal gain in continuously pumped silicon-waveguide raman amplifiers made with silicon-on-insulator technology. our method allows for pump-power depletion during raman amplification and makes use of a variational technique. its use leads to a system of four coupled nonlinear differential equations, whose numerical solution provides the optimal axial profile of the effective mode area along the waveguide length that maximizes the output signal power for a given amplifier length and a preset input (or output) cross-section area. in practice, the optimum profile can be realized by varying the cross-section area of a silicon waveguide along its length by tapering its width appropriately.
backgroundcardiovascular disease (cvd) is the leading cause of death among older people in africa. this study aimed to investigate the relationship of urbanization and ethnicity with cvd risk markers in kenya.methodsa cross-sectional population-based survey was carried out in nakuru kenya in 2007-2008. 100 clusters of 50 people aged ≥50 years were selected by probability proportionate to size sampling. households within clusters were selected through compact segment sampling. participants were interviewed by nurses to collect socio-demographic and lifestyle information. nurses measured blood pressure, height, weight and waist and hip circumference. a random finger-prick blood sample was taken to measure glucose and cholesterol levels.hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (sbp) ≥140 mm hg, or diastolic blood pressure (dbp) ≥90 mm hg or current use of antihypertensive medication; diabetes as reported current medication or diet control for diabetes or random blood glucose level ≥11.1 mmol/l; high cholesterol as random blood cholesterol level ≥5.2 mmol/l; and obesity as body mass index (bmi)≥30 kg/m2.results5010 eligible subjects were selected, of whom 4396 (88%) were examined. there was a high prevalence of hypertension (50.1%, 47.5-52.6%), obesity (13.0%, 11.7-14.5%), diabetes (6.6%, 5.6-7.7%) and high cholesterol (21.1%, 18.6-23.9). hypertension, diabetes and obesity were more common in urban compared to rural groups and the elevated prevalence generally persisted after adjustment for socio-demographic, lifestyle, obesity and cardiovascular risk markers. there was also a higher prevalence of hypertension, obesity, diabetes and high cholesterol among kikuyus compared to kalenjins, even after multivariate adjustment. cvd risk markers were clustered both across the district and within individuals. few people received treatment for hypertension (15%), while the majority of cases with diabetes received treatment (68%).conclusionscvd risk markers are common in kenya, particularly in urban areas. exploring differences in cvd risk markers between ethnic groups may help to elucidate the epidemiology of these conditions. although demography continues to be the most prominent discipline concerned with population dynamics, involvement of other disciplines is highly desirable. the case for a multidisciplinary approach to population theory has been aptly stated by kurt mayer: “any meaningful interpretation of the cause and effects of population changes must … extend beyond formal statistical measurement of the components of change, i.e. fertility, mortality and migration, and draw on the theoretical framework of several other disciplines for assistance (mayer 1962).” in noting that the “analysis of the causal determinants and consequences of population change forms the subject matter of population theory,” mayer inferentially acknowledges the epidemiologic character of population phenomena, for as its etymology indicates, (epi, upon; demos, people; logos, study), epidemiology is the study of what “comes upon” groups of people. more specifically, epidemiology is concerned with the distribution of disease and death, and with their determinants and consequences in population groups. inasmuch as patterns of health and disease are integral components of population change, epidemiology's reservoir of knowledge about these patterns and their determinants in population groups serves not only as a basis for prediction of population change but also as a source of hypotheses that can be further tested to correct, refine and build population theory. furthermore, many epidemiologic techniques that have heretofore been limited to the examination of health and disease patterns can be profitably applied as well to the exploration of other mass phenomena, such as fertility control.    a theory of epidemiologic transition, sensitive to the formulations of population theorists who have stressed the demographic, biologic, sociologic, economic and psychologic ramifications of transitional processes, was conceived by this author less than four years ago. recognition of the limitations of demographic transition theory and of the need for comprehensive approaches to population dynamics stimulated the development of this theory (van nort and karon 1955; micklin 1968).
onychomycosis is a common fungal infection, afflicting some 10% of the adult population in industrialized countries. aside from cosmetic concerns, onychomycosis can be the cause of toe and foot pain, as well as the underlying etiology for serious secondary bacterial infections and traumatic ulcerations. in select populations, such as diabetics, the latter conditions may even result in loss of all or part of the lower extremity. thus, a simple, cost-effective and safe treatment for onychomycosis is highly desirable. although both topical and oral systemic antifungal agents are available for this purpose, they are not always effective, carry some medical risks, are associated with potentially significant drug-drug interactions, and may be unacceptable to patient and healthcare provider alike. physical modalities, such as laser therapy, therefore appear appealing. the question is whether laser treatment is sufficiently efficacious and safe to warrant the current high cost per treatment. the readily available literature on this controversy will be reviewed herein. it has always been difficult to treat onychomycosis due to decrease ability of topical agents to penetrate the nail and reach the affected nail bed. oral antifungal have shown good response but due to longer duration course it has potential to cause systemic side effects, leading to patient non‐adherence and adverse events. lasers, therefore, have been suggested for the treatment of onychomycosis due to their minimally invasive nature and the potential for requiring fewer treatment sessions. the aim of writing this article is to review a literature regarding treatment of onychomycosis by laser. this article will discuss about all the available laser treatment options for onychomycosis as well as their currently published, peer‐reviewed literature.
diabetes results from a reduction of pancreatic β-cells. stimulating replication could normalize β-cell mass. however, adult human β-cells are recalcitrant to proliferation. we identified osteoprotegerin, a bone-related decoy receptor, as a β-cell mitogen. osteoprotegerin was induced by and required for lactogen-mediated rodent β-cell replication. osteoprotegerin enhanced β-cell proliferation in young, aged, and diabetic mice. this resulted in increased β-cell mass in young mice and significantly delayed hyperglycemia in diabetic mice. osteoprotegerin stimulated replication of adult human β-cells, without causing dedifferentiation. mechanistically, osteoprotegerin induced human and rodent β-cell replication by modulating creb and gsk3 pathways, through binding receptor activator of nf-κb (rank) ligand (rankl), a brake in β-cell proliferation. denosumab, an fda-approved osteoporosis drug, and rankl-specific antibody induced human β-cell proliferation in vitro, and in vivo, in humanized mice. thus, osteoprotegerin and denosumab prevent rankl/rank interaction to stimulate β-cell replication, highlighting the potential for repurposing an osteoporosis drug to treat diabetes. abstract the cyclic amp (camp) signaling pathway is central in β-cell gene expression and function. in the nucleus, protein kinase a (pka) phosphorylates creb, resulting in recruitment of the transcriptional coactivators p300 and creb binding protein (cbp). cbp, but not p300, is phosphorylated at serine 436 in response to insulin action. cbp phosphorylation disrupts creb-cbp interaction and thus reduces nuclear camp action. to elucidate the importance of the camp-pka-creb-cbp pathway in pancreatic β cells specifically at the nuclear level, we have examined mutant mice lacking the insulin-dependent phosphorylation site of cbp. in these mice, the creb-cbp interaction is enhanced in both the absence and presence of camp stimulation. we found that islet and β-cell masses were increased twofold, while pancreas weights were not different from the weights of wild-type littermates. β-cell proliferation was increased both in vivo and in vitro in isolated islet cultures. surprisingly, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from perfused, isolated mutant islets was reduced. however, β-cell depolarization with kcl induced similar levels of insulin release from mutant and wild-type islets, indicating normal insulin synthesis and storage. in addition, transcripts of pgc1a, which disrupts glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, were also markedly elevated. in conclusion, sustained activation of cbp-responsive genes results in increased β-cell proliferation. in these β cells, however, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was diminished, resulting from concomitant creb-cbp-mediated pgc1a gene activation.
whereas outdoor navigation systems typically rely upon gps, indoor systems have to rely upon dierent techniques for localizing the user, as gps signals cannot be received indoors. over the past decade various indoor navigation systems have been developed. this paper provides a comprehensive overview of existing indoor navigation systems and analyzes the dierent techniques used for: (1) locating the user; (2) planning a path; (3) representing the environment; and (4) interacting with the user. our survey identies a number of research issues that could facilitate large scale deployment of indoor navigation systems. in the research project navio (pedestrian navigation systems in combined indoor/outdoor environements) at our university we are working on the improvement of navigation services for pedestrians. thereby we are mainly focusing on the information aspect of location-based services, i.e., on the user’s task at hand and the support of the user’s decisions by information provided by such a service. specifications will allow us to select appropriate sensor data and to integrate data when and where needed, to propose context-dependent routes fitting to partly conflicting interests and goals as well as to select appropriate communication methods in terms of supporting the user guidance by various multimedia cartography forms. these taks are addressed in the project in three different work packages, i.e., the first on “integrated positioning”, the second on “pedestrian route modeling” and the third on “multimedia route communication”. in this paper we will concentrate on the research work and findings in the first work package. for continuous positioning of a pedestrian suitable location technologies include gnss and indoor location techniques, cellular phone positioning, dead reckoning sensors (e.g. magnetic compass, gyro and accelerometers) for measurement of heading and travelled distance as well as barometric pressure sensors for height determination. the integration of these sensors in a modern multi-sensor system can be performed using an adapted kalman filter. to test and to demonstrate our approach, we take a use case scenario into account, i.e., the guidance of visitors to departments of the vienna university of technology. the results of simulation studies and practical tests could confirm that such a service can achieve a high level of performance for the guidance of a pedestrian in urban areas and mixed indoor and outdoor environments.
bile acid sequestrants (bas) represent a therapeutic approach for the management of hypercholesterolemia that relies on the cationic polymeric nature of bas to selectively bind negatively charged bile acids. we hypothesized that the cross-linking of β-cyclodextrin (β-cd) and saccharides such as starch or dextrin with divinyl sulfone (dvs) yields homo- and hetero-polymeric materials with the ability to trap sterols. our hypothesis was put to test by synthesizing a library of 22 polymers that were screened to evaluate their capability to sequester both cholesterol (chol) and cholic and deoxycholic acids (ca and dca). three polymers synthesized in high yield were identified as promising. two were neutral hetero-polymers of β-cd and starch or dextrin and the third was a weakly cationic homo-polymer of starch, highlighting the importance of the cavity effect. they were tested in hypercholesterolemic male wistar rats and their ability to regulate hypercholesterolemia was similar to that for the reference bas cholestyramine, but with two additional advantages: (i) they normalized the tg level and (ii) they did not increase the creatinine level. neither hepatotoxicity nor kidney injury was detected, further supporting them as therapeutical candidates to manage hypercholesterolemia. beta-cyclodextrin is a compound that forms inclusion complexes with a variety of molecules, specially bile acids and sterols. this study examines the effects of beta-cyclodextrin on cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in hypercholesterolaemic rats. male wistar rats were divided into 4 groups that received during 7 weeks: control diet, 2% cholesterol diet (a), a+2.5% beta-cyclodextrin (b) and a+5% beta-cyclodextrin (c). the cholesterol-rich diet induced hepatomegaly and fatty liver and significantly reduced cholesterol, bile acid and phospholipid secretion. addition of beta-cyclodextrin normalised biliary lipid secretion. moreover, when compared to a, beta-cyclodextrin significantly lowered plasma phospholipid concentration (b: -21%; c: -29%) and the liver free/total cholesterol molar ratio (b: -40%; c: -38%), increased bile acid faecal output (b: +17%; c: +62%) and enhanced cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase activity (b:+50%; c : +100%)and mrna levels (b: + 14%; c: +29%). 5% beta-cyclodextrin also reduced plasma triglycerides concentration (-38%). however, alt and ast activities were significantly increased (b: +140% and +280%; c: +72% and +135%) and there was a high incidence of cell necrosis with portal inflammatory cell infiltration. addition of beta-cyclodextrin to a cholesterol-rich diet results in a triglyceride-lowering action, enhancement of bile acid synthesis and excretion, and normalization of biliary lipid secretion, but produces a marked hepatotoxic effect.
estrogen influences the development and function of the nervous system through estrogen receptor-dependent changes in gene expression and by rapidly influencing diverse intracellular signaling pathways. we have investigated the influence of estradiol on developing neonatal rat cerebellar neurons in primary culture and found that low concentrations of 17β-estradiol (17β-e2), 17α-e2, 17β-e2-bsa, and ici182,780 stimulated phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (erk1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapk). neither testosterone nor progesterone increased erk1/2 phosphorylation. the effects of the estrogens were specific to the erk1/2 mapk pathway and were blocked by u0126, an inhibitor of the erk1/2 mapk kinase (mek1/2). compared with control cultures, significant mapk-dependent decreases in viable granule cell numbers were observed in dissociated explant cultures of developing cerebellar neurons 24–96 hr after pulse treatment with 10 pm 17β-e2 or 10 nm ici182,780. in contrast, continuous exposure to 10 pm 17β-e2 significantly increased granule cell numbers. analysis of bromodeoxyuridine incorporation revealed that a 15 min pulsed treatment with 10 pm 17β-e2 increased mitogenesis, whereas continuous exposure to the same concentration of 17β-e2 was anti-mitotic. estradiol did not increase caspase activity; however, significant increases in cellular permeability and lysis were observed. cell lysis and death were independent of the pan-caspase inhibitor zvad-fmk but were blocked fully by the irreversible calpain inhibitor pd150606. these results indicate that rapid activation of the erk1/2 mapk pathway by low concentrations of 17β-e2 induces oncotic/necrotic, but not apoptotic, programmed cell death in a subpopulation of developing granule cells and increased mitogenesis of the granule cell neuroblasts refractory to estrogen-induced neurotoxicity. cell death is generally classified into two large categories: apoptosis represents active, programmed cell death, while necrosis represents passive cell death without underlying regulatory mechanisms. recent progress revealed that caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, play a central role in the regulation of apoptosis. unexpectedly, however, caspase inhibition occasionally turns the morphology of programmed cell death from apoptotic into necrotic without inhibiting death itself. in this article, we review different models of caspase-independent programmed cell death showing necrotic-like morphology, including our ras-mediated caspase-independent cell death. based on these findings, we suggest the existence of a necrotic-like cell death regulated by cellular intrinsic death programs distinct from that of apoptosis. even though type 2 physiological cell death, or autophagic degeneration, has been recognized as a necrotic-like programmed cell death for a long time, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been identified despite its physiological significance. this has been in part due to the previous absence of adequate caspase-independent cellular models to study, recent efforts may now help to elucidate these mechanisms.
we evaluated stock structure and demographic (population) history of red snapper (lutjanus campechanus) in the northern gulf of mexico (gulf) via analysis of mitochondrial (mt)dna sequences from 360 individuals sampled from four cohorts (year classes) at three localities across the northern gulf. exact tests of genetic homogeneity and analysis of molecular variance both among cohorts within localities and among localities were non-significant. nested clade analysis provided evidence of different temporal episodes of both range expansion and restricted gene flow due to isolation by distance. a mismatch distribution of pairwise differences among mtdna haplotypes and a maximum-likelihood coalescence analysis indicated a population expansion phase that dated to the pleistocene and probably represents (re)colonization of the continental shelf following glacial retreat. the spatial distribution of red snapper in the northern gulf appears to have a complex history that likely reflects glacial advance/retreat, habitat availability and suitability, and hydrology. habitat availability/suitability and hydrology may partially restrict gene flow among present-day red snapper in the northern gulf and give rise to a metapopulation structure with variable demographic connectivity. this type of population structure may be difficult to detect with commonly used, selectively neutral genetic markers. since the 1920s, population geneticists have had measures that describe how genetic variation is distributed spatially within a species’ geographical range. modern genetic survey techniques frequently yield information on the evolutionary relationships among the alleles or haplotypes as well as information on allele frequencies and their spatial distributions. this evolutionary information is often expressed in the form of an estimated haplotype or allele tree. traditional statistics of population structure, such as f statistics, do not make use of evolutionary genealogical information, so it is necessary to develop new statistical estimators and tests that explicitly incorporate information from the haplotype tree. one such technique is to use the haplotype tree to define a nested series of branches (clades), thereby allowing an evolutionary nested analysis of the spatial distribution of genetic variation. such a nested analysis can be performed regarding the geographical sampling locations either as categorical or continuous variables (i.e. some measure of spatial distance). it is shown that such nested phylogeographical analyses have more power to detect geographical associations than traditional, nonhistorical analyses and, as a consequence, allow a broader range of gene‐flow parameters to be estimated in a precise fashion. more importantly, such nested analyses can discriminate between phylogeographical associations due to recurrent but restricted gene flow vs. historical events operating at the population level (e.g. past fragmentation, colonization, or range expansion events). restricted gene flow and historical events can be intertwined, and the cladistic analyses can reconstruct their temporal juxtapositions, thereby yielding great insight into both the evolutionary history and population structure of the species. examples are given that illustrate these properties, concentrating on the detection of range expansion events.
spawning female blue crabs, callinectes sapidus, use ebb-tide transport (ett) to migrate seaward. in estuaries with semi-diurnal tides, ett in ovigerous blue crabs is driven by a circatidal rhythm in vertical swimming in which crabs ascend into the water column during ebb tide. the ontogeny of this rhythm was examined by monitoring swimming behavior of females before the pubertal molt, females that had recently undergone the molt but had not yet produced a clutch of eggs, and ovigerous females from an estuary with strong semi-diurnal tides. to assess variation in swimming rhythms with ambient tidal regime, swimming rhythms of ovigerous females from semi-diurnal (beaufort, north carolina), diurnal (st. andrew bay, florida), and non-tidal (south river, north carolina) estuaries were compared. experiments were conducted during the summers of 2006–2008. female crabs prior to oviposition had variable endogenous swimming rhythms (circadian, circatidal, or circalunidian). ovigerous females from estuaries with semi-diurnal and diurnal tides had pronounced circatidal or circalunidian rhythms with swimming during the time of ambient ebb tide. swimming rhythms of several ovigerous crabs switched between circatidal and circalunidian during the ~5-day observation period. ovigerous crabs from a non-tidal estuary had a circadian rhythm with vertical swimming around the time of sunset. these results suggest that, while endogenous swimming rhythms are present in some female blue crabs prior to oviposition, rapid seaward movement via ett in tidal estuaries begins following oviposition of the first clutch of eggs. abstract ovigerous blue crabs, callinectes sapidus rathbun, undergo ebb-tide transport (ett) during the spawning migration from estuaries to coastal areas where they release larvae. an initial field study found that only females with mature embryos underwent the spawning migration and that postspawned females switched to flood-tide transport for movement back into and up estuaries. alternatively, a more recent field study found ett occurred in females throughout embryo development and continued after larval release. an endogenous rhythm in vertical migration underlies ett during the spawning migration. a past study found the circatidal rhythm was only present in females with mature embryos but not in females with immature embryos or after larval release. the present study reinvestigates this rhythm in vertical migration. both females with early embryos and postlarval release females entrained in the field have circatidal rhythms, in which they swim vertically at the time of consecutive ebb tides at the collection site or on alternate ebb tides. these results support the field study that ovigerous females undergo ett throughout embryo development and after larval release. thus, females will be transported seaward and release subsequent larval clutches in coastal areas that increase the likelihood that larvae will be transported to offshore developmental areas.
efficient and secure network services in wireless sensor networks making effective use of the vast amounts of data gathered by large-scale sensor networks will require scalable, self-organizing, and energy-efficient data dissemination algorithms. previous work has identified data-centric routing as one such method. in an asso-ciated position paper [23], we argue that a companion method, data-centric storage (dcs), is also a useful approach. under dcs, sensed data are stored at a node determined by the name associated with the sensed data. in this paper, we describe ght, a geographic hash table system for dcs on sensornets. ght hashes keys into geographic coordi-nates, and stores a key-value pair at the sensor node geographically nearest the hash of its key. the system replicates stored data lo-cally to ensure persistence when nodes fail. it uses an efficient consistency protocol to ensure that key-value pairs are stored at the appropriate nodes after topological changes. and it distributes load throughout the network using a geographic hierarchy. we evaluate the performance of ght as a dcs system in simulation against two other dissemination approaches. our results demonstrate that ght is the preferable approach for the application workloads predicted in [23], offers high data availability, and scales to large sensornet deployments, even when nodes fail or are mobile.
overview: over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that cognitive enhancement with noninvasive brain stimulation (nbs) is a real phenomenon. recently, it has been suggested that such enhancements be viewed within the framework of a zero-sum game: that the performance enhancements found with nbs represent a re-allotment of finite processing resources, with the gains in one situation balanced by costs elsewhere. in examining the nbs literature, we have found that about half of reports of nbs enhancements may have been the result of resource reallocation, although it is not clear that a cost can be identified in each situation. moreover, the other half of reports suggest that nbs can cause not a resource reallocation but an actual addition of resources available. it is suggested here that while it is important to examine whether costs occur with nbs, a more helpful framework from which to understand cognitive enhancements with nbs may be to understand brains as systems designed to continuously enhance their own functions and available resources (through learning, automatizing useful behaviors, etc.), and to view nbs as a means to augment these ongoing processes. here we review the usefulness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) in modulating cortical networks in ways that might produce performance enhancements in healthy human subjects. to date over sixty studies have reported significant improvements in speed and accuracy in a variety of tasks involving perceptual, motor, and executive processing. two basic categories of enhancement mechanisms are suggested by this literature: direct modulation of a cortical region or network that leads to more efficient processing, and addition-by-subtraction, which is disruption of processing which competes or distracts from task performance. potential applications of tms cognitive enhancement, including research into cortical function, rehabilitation therapy in neurological and psychiatric illness, and accelerated skill acquisition in healthy individuals are discussed, as are methods of optimizing the magnitude and duration of tms-induced performance enhancement, such as improvement of targeting through further integration of brain imaging with tms. one technique, combining multiple sessions of tms with concurrent tms/task performance to induce hebbian-like learning, appears to be promising for prolonging enhancement effects. while further refinements in the application of tms to cognitive enhancement can still be made, and questions remain regarding the mechanisms underlying the observed effects, this appears to be a fruitful area of investigation that may shed light on the basic mechanisms of cognitive function and their therapeutic modulation.
background diagnostic and therapeutic importance of pelvic lymph node (ln) dissection (plnd) in radical cystectomy (rc) has gained recent attention. a method of pathological analysis of ln affects total number of ln removed, number of ln involved, and ln density.   objective to compare extended lymphadenectomy to standard lymphadenectomy in terms of ln yield, density, and effect on survival.   materials and methods from jan 2004 - july 2009, 78 patients underwent rc whose complete histopathological report was available for analysis. all were transitional cell carcinoma. from july 2007 onward extended ln dissection was started and lns were sent in six packets. twenty-eight patients of standard plnd kept in group i. group ii had 23 patients of standard plnd (ln sent in four packets), and group iii had 23 patients of extended plnd (ln sent in six packets). spss 15 software used for statistical calculation.   results distribution of t-stage among three groups is not statistically significant. median number of ln harvested were 5 (range, 1-25) in group i, 9 (range, 3-28) in group ii, and 16 (range, 1-25) in group iii. although this is significant, we did not find significant difference in number of positive ln harvested. we did not find any patient with skip metastasis to common iliac ln in group 3.   conclusions separate package ln evaluation significantly increased the total number of ln harvested without increasing the number of positive ln and survival. purpose to our knowledge the extent of lymphadenectomy with cystectomy, the number of lymph nodes to be retrieved and the anatomical groups to be dissected are still undetermined. this study was done to clarify these issues.   materials and methods a total of 200 patients underwent radical cystectomy and extended lymphadenectomy up to the level of origin of the inferior mesenteric artery. removed tissues were labeled according to anatomical location and sent separately for pathological evaluation. in each group the number and status of lymph nodes were determined. the number of positive nodes was correlated with the number of retrieved nodes. cases with a single positive node were identified and the anatomical location was defined.   results the mean number of retrieved nodes per patient +/- se was 50.6 +/- 14.4 and 48 (24%) patients had nodal disease. the mean number of positive nodes per involved case was 8.08 +/- 13.2. there was a weak correlation between the number of positive nodes and the number of harvested nodes. bilateral disease was noted in 39.6% of cases. single node involvement was observed in 22 cases, of which all except 1 were in the endopelvic region.   conclusions there is a sentinel region, which is the endopelvic region (that is the internal iliac and obturator groups of lymph nodes). there are no skipped lesions. negative nodes in the endopelvic region indicate that more proximal dissection is not necessary. bilateral endopelvic dissection is mandatory.
abstract campylobacter jejuni, a gram-negative, invasive organism, is a common cause of food-borne bacterial diarrheal disease. however, the relationship between c. jejuni and the innate immune system is not well described. to better characterize host defense against c. jejuni, we investigated the ability of nitric oxide/reactive nitrogen species to kill two strains of c. jejuni. c. jejuni viability was measured after exposure to reactive nitrogen species produced biochemically as acidified nitrite and by bone marrow-derived macrophages. we report that acidified nitrite caused a 3-log-increased kill of c. jejuni (p < 0.05) at doses that did not affect the viability of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. expression of nos2, the gene responsible for the production of inducible nitric oxide, was increased >100-fold in murine macrophages after incubation with c. jejuni (p < 0.001). these macrophages effected a 2-log-increased kill of c. jejuni over 24 h compared to that by nos2−/− macrophages unable to produce nitric oxide (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that the mammalian host upregulates the production of nitric oxide in response to exposure to c. jejuni and that nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen species comprise part of the innate defense mechanisms that contribute to the resolution of c. jejuni infection. abstract salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium and dublin lysed primary bovine alveolar macrophages and immortalized j774.2 macrophage-like cells in the absence of either the morphological changes or dna fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis. macrophage lysis was dependent on a subset of caspases and an intactsipb gene.
cancer is often associated with multiple and progressive genetic alterations in genes that are important for normal development. bcas3 (breast cancer amplified sequence 3) is a gene of unknown function on human chromosome 17q23, a region associated with breakpoints of several neoplasms. the normal expression pattern of bcas3 has not been studied, though it is implicated in breast cancer progression. rudhira, a murine wd40 domain protein that is 98% identical to bcas3 is expressed in embryonic stem (es) cells, erythropoiesis and angiogenesis. this suggests that bcas3 expression also may not be restricted to mammary tissue and may have important roles in other normal as well as malignant tissues. we show that bcas3 is also expressed in human es cells and during their differentiation into blood vascular precursors. we find that bcas3 is aberrantly expressed in malignant human brain lesions. in glioblastoma, hemangiopericytoma and brain abscess we note high levels of bcas3 expression in tumor cells and some blood vessels. bcas3 may be associated with multiple cancerous and rapidly proliferating cells and hence the expression, function and regulation of this gene merits further investigation. we suggest that bcas3 is mis-expressed in brain tumors and could serve as a human es cell and tumor marker. desmoplastic medulloblastoma (dmb) is a malignant cerebellar tumour composed of two distinct tissue components, pale islands and desmoplastic areas. previous studies revealed mutations in genes encoding members of the sonic hedgehog pathway, including ptch, smoh and sufuh in dmbs. however, little is known about other genomic aberrations. we performed comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) analysis of 22 sporadic dmbs and identified chromosomal imbalances in 20 tumours (91%; mean, 4.9 imbalances/tumour). recurrent chromosomal gains were found on chromosomes 3, 9 (six tumours each), 20, 22 (five tumours each), 2, 6, 7, 17 (four tumours each) and 1 (three tumours). recurrent losses involved chromosomes x (eight tumours), y (six of eleven tumours from male patients), 9, 12 (four tumours each), as well as 10, 13 and 17 (three tumours each). four tumours demonstrated high‐level amplifications involving sequences from 1p22, 5p15, 9p, 12p13, 13q33‐q34 and 17q22‐q24, respectively. further analysis of the 9p and 17q22‐q24 amplicons by array‐based cgh (matrix‐cgh) and candidate gene analyses revealed amplification of jmjd2c at 9p24 in one dmb and amplification of rps6kb1, appbp2, ppm1d and bcas3 from 17q23 in three dmbs. among the 17q23 genes, rps6kb1 showed markedly elevated transcript levels as compared to normal cerebellum in five of six dmbs and four of five classic medulloblastomas investigated. finally, cgh analysis of microdissected pale islands and desmoplastic areas showed common chromosomal imbalances in five of six informative tumours. in summary, we have identified several novel genetic alterations in dmbs and provide genetic evidence for a monoclonal origin of their different tissue components. copyright © 2006 pathological society of great britain and ireland. published by john wiley & sons, ltd.
backgroundpulmonary embolism (pe) is an underdiagnosed entity in the pediatric population in part because of the low level of suspicion and awareness in the clinical world.objectiveto examine its relative prevalence, associated risk factors and imaging features in our pediatric population.materials and methodsa total of 92 patients age 21 years and younger with a high clinical suspicion of pe and who had available radiographic studies were identified from january 2003 to september 2006. patients with a positive ct scan or a high probability ventilation/perfusion scan formed the case group; patients with a high clinical suspicion of pe and no radiographic evidence of pe or deep venous thrombosis (dvt), randomly matched in age and sex, became the matched control group. we reviewed the charts of both groups and analyzed the imaging studies.resultsin our hospital, the prevalence of pe in patients with a strong suspicion of pe was 14%. the overall prevalence of thromboembolic disease (pe and/or dvt) was 25%. recent surgery or orthopedic procedure, blood dyscrasias and contraceptive use were more common in patients with pe. no child died of pe in our study. the youngest child with pe in our study was 13 years. girls were twice as likely to develop pe as boys.conclusionpe is a relatively common diagnosis in our tertiary care pediatric population when the clinical suspicion is high. we suggest increased awareness and index of suspicion in order to initiate prompt diagnostic imaging and treatment. summary.  venous thromboembolic (vte) events are being increasingly diagnosed in systemic and cerebral vessels in children. systemic vte are increasing in children as a result of therapeutic advances and improved clinical acumen in primary illnesses that previously caused mortality. the epidemiology of systemic vte has been studied in international registries. in children older than 3 months, teenagers are the largest group developing vte. the most common etiologic factor is the presence of central venous lines. clinical studies have determined the most sensitive diagnostic method for diagnosing upper system vte are ultrasound for jugular venous thrombosis and venography for intrathoracic vessels. however, the most sensitive diagnostic methods for lower system vte and pulmonary embolism (pe) have not been established. treatment studies for vte consist of inadequately powered randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. the long‐term outcome of systemic vte, post‐thrombotic syndrome, has been reported in children. cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (csvt) is becoming increasingly diagnosed in children due to the recognition of the associated subtle clinical symptoms and improved cerebrovascular imaging. the etiology of csvt includes thrombophilia, head and neck infections, and systemic illness. estimates of the incidence and outcome of childhood csvt have recently become available through the canadian pediatric ischaemic stroke registry. clinical studies have not yet been carried out in children to determine the best method of diagnosis or treatment. there have only been case‐series studies carried out in the treatment of csvt. properly designed clinical trials are urgently required in children with systemic vte/pe and csvt to define the best methods of diagnosis, treatment and long‐term management.
backgroundit remains unknown whether primary ocular adnexal extranodal marginal zone b-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (malt lymphoma) is a homogeneous entity, as there are few reports of the results of cytogenetic or molecular analyses of these tumors.methodswe performed interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) analysis to detect translocations and aneuploidy in 34 cases of primary ocular adnexal malt lymphoma, and reviewed the histopathological findings. correlations between the results of fish analysis, the histopathological features and the clinical data were also analyzed.resultsamong the 34 cases, fish analysis revealed t(14;18)(q32;q21) in one case, trisomy 3 in 21 cases (62%), and trisomy 18 in 16 cases (47%). the cases with trisomy 18 had significantly more prominent lymphoepithelial lesions (lels) and less nodularity in the tumors. in regard to the clinical correlations, tumors with trisomy 18 were observed predominantly in females and younger patients; also, in the majority of the cases, the tumor was of conjunctival origin. all the cases with recurrence showed trisomy 18 in the tumor.conclusionprimary ocular adnexal malt lymphoma is a significantly heterogeneous entity. cases with trisomy 18 may have unique clinicopathological features. we performed a prospective multiparametric correlative clinical, histopathologic, and immunologic analysis of 117 ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations developing in 108 patients between october 1977 and july 1987. the ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations were distributed among the 108 patients as follows: orbit 69 (64%), conjunctiva 30 (28%), and eyelids nine (8%). the 117 ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations were classified as follows: polyclonal lymphoid hyperplasia, 32 (22 orbit, nine conjunctiva, one eyelid) (27%); monoclonal b cell lymphoma, 81 (48 orbit, 25 conjunctiva, eight eyelid) (69%); null cell lymphoma, one (orbit) (1%); and histologically indeterminate, three (one each: orbit, conjunctiva, eyelid) (3%). patients presenting with ocular adnexal polyclonal lymphoid hyperplasia and monoclonal b cell lymphoma, and patients developing unilateral and bilateral ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations did not differ significantly with respect to age, sex, presenting complaints, duration of symptoms, or ophthalmic findings. classifying ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations into benign and malignant categories by histopathologic criteria and into polyclonal and monoclonal b cell categories by immunophenotypic criteria was not useful in predicting eventual outcome, including the occurrence of extraocular lymphoma. however, the clinicopathologic characteristics did differ according to the anatomic site of involvement and histopathology of the ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations. lymphoid infiltrates of the conjunctiva were associated with a lower incidence of extra-ocular lymphoma (20%) than were those of the orbit and eyelid, 35% and 67%, respectively (statistically significant, p less than .03). ocular adnexal small lymphocytic and intermediate lymphocytic lymphomas were less often associated with extra-ocular lymphoma than were ocular adnexal lymphomas of all other histologic types, 27% and 46%, respectively (p less than .09). however, the single most important and statistically significant prognostic factor in these patients was the extent of disease at the time of presentation with an ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferation (p less than .001). eighty-six percent of patients presenting with a unilateral or bilateral clinical stage le ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferation, regardless of the histopathology or the immunophenotype, had a benign indolent clinical course and failed to develop ocular or extra-ocular lymphoma during a median follow-up period of 51 months. the results of this study substantially improve our understanding of extranodal small lymphocytic proliferations in general, and those of the ocular adnexa in particular.
background possible associations of parasite infection with cancer risk have recently attracted much attention. published studies concerning the association between toxoplasma gondii (t. gondii) infection and leukemia risk have generated inconsistent results. in the present study, we aimed to address this topic by conducting a quantitative meta-analysis. material/methods relevant publications were searched in electronic databases and eligible studies were rigorously screened and selected. essential information was extracted and the data were pooled. subgroup analysis on source of controls and detection target was also performed. results a total of 6 studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected. the overall data show that t. gondii infection might have an association with increased leukemia risk (or=3.05; 95%ci=1.83–5.08). similar results were shown in the subgroups regarding source of controls and detection target. conclusions our results suggest that t. gondii infection might be a risk factor for leukemia, providing new insight into the etiology of leukemia. future studies with large sample sizes in different geographic areas are needed to confirm this conclusion. toxoplasma gondii is a worldwide prevalent pathogen that infects most of the warm-blood vertebrates. to investigate the regulation network of splenic mirnas altered by acute infection with t. gondii, we herein investigated the changes of mirna profile in mouse spleen via next generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. a total of 379 mirnas was identified, 131 mirnas of them were differentially expressed (including 97 upregulated and 34 downregulated mirnas). 48 differentially expressed mirnas had validated targets in the mirwalk2.0 database. gene ontology (go) enrichment analysis revealed that the validated targets of differently expressed mirnas were significantly enriched in gene transcription regulation. it suggested that t. gondii can modulate host gene expression through targeting to trans-regulation factors. the genes involved in apoptosis or anti-apoptosis were both targeted by differentially expressed mirnas. the change of power balance between the mirnas targeting host apoptosis genes and those regulating host anti-apoptosis genes contributes to the fate of host apoptosis process. twelve pathways were significantly enriched in kegg analysis with most of them being cancer related, including pathways in cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, axon guidance, mapk signaling pathway, focal adhesion, chronic myeloid leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, glioma, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and wnt signaling pathway. our study showed a changed mirna regulation network in mouse spleen infected by t. gondii. these findings will be helpful for better understanding of mirna regulation network in host-t. gondii interaction, revealing the relationship among t. gondii infection, gene regulation, apoptosis and cancer process alterations in infected spleen.
purposeobstructive sleep apnea (osa) has been implicated in complications of cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (scd). prolonged qt interval is associated with arrhythmias and scd in patients with cardiovascular disease and apparently healthy humans. apneic episodes during sleep in osa patients are associated with qt prolongation due to increased vagal activity, but it is not understood whether chronic qt prolongation persists during normoxic daytime wakefulness.methodsto determine whether daytime qt intervals in osa patients are prolonged compared to control subjects, we recruited 97 (76 male, 21 female) newly diagnosed patients with osa [apnea-hypopnea index (ahi) ≥5 events/h] and 168 (100 male, 68 female) healthy volunteers (ahi <5 events/h) and measured daytime resting qt and rr intervals from the electrocardiograms to determine qt prolongation corrected for heart rate (qtc).resultsall subjects with osa were older and heavier, with increased heart rate, significantly increased ahi and arousal index, and reduced oxygen saturation (spo2) during sleep, and spent less time in sleep with >90 % spo2 compared to respective controls. qtc in patients with osa (410 ± 3.3 for male and 433 ± 5.6 for female) was significantly increased compared to respective control groups (399 ± 2.9 for male and 417 ± 2.9 for female), after adjustment for age and body mass index.conclusionsour data show that osa in either men or women is associated with a significant increase in resting daytime qtc. the propensity for ventricular arrhythmias in patients with osa may be a result of abnormalities in resting cardiac repolarization. background—whenever a proband is identified with long-qt syndrome (lqts), his or her parents and siblings should be evaluated regarding the possibility of carrying the disorder. in the majority of cases, one of the proband’s parents and one or more siblings are affected. the aim of this study was (1) to determine whether the clinical severity of lqts in the proband is useful in identifying first-degree family members at high risk for cardiac events, and (2) to evaluate the clinical course of affected parents and siblings of lqts probands. methods and results—the clinical and ecg characteristics of 211 lqts probands and 791 first-degree relatives (422 parents and 369 siblings) were studied to determine if the clinical profile of the proband is useful in determining the clinical severity of lqts in affected parents and siblings. affected female parents of an lqts proband had a greater cumulative risk for a first cardiac event than affected male parents. the probability of a parent or sibling having a first cardiac event was not significantly influenced by the severity of the proband’s clinical symptoms. female sex and qtc duration were risk factors for cardiac events among affected parents, and qtc was the only risk factor for cardiac events in affected siblings. conclusions—the severity profile of lqts in a proband was not found to be useful in identifying the clinical severity of lqts in affected first-degree relatives of the proband.
infant formula and breastfeeding are environmental factors that influence the incidence of type 1 diabetes (t1d) as well as the acidity of newborn diets. to determine if altering the intestinal microbiome is one mechanism through which an acidic liquid plays a role in t1d, we placed non-obese diabetic (nod)/shiltjt mice on neutral (n) or acidified h2o and monitored the impact on microbial composition and diabetes incidence. nod-n mice showed an increased development of diabetes, while exhibiting a decrease in firmicutes and an increase in bacteroidetes, actinobacteria, and proteobacteria from as early as 2 weeks of age. nod-n mice had a decrease in the levels of foxp3 expression in cd4+foxp3+ cells, as well as decreased cd4+il17+ cells, and a lower ratio of il17/ifnγ cd4+ t-cells. our data clearly indicates that a change in the acidity of liquids consumed dramatically alters the intestinal microbiome, the presence of protective th17 and treg cells, and the incidence of diabetes. this data suggests that early dietary manipulation of intestinal microbiota may be a novel mechanism to delay t1d onset in genetically pre-disposed individuals. the gastrointestinal tract of mammals is inhabited by hundreds of distinct species of commensal microorganisms that exist in a mutualistic relationship with the host. how commensal microbiota influence the host immune system is poorly understood. we show here that colonization of the small intestine of mice with a single commensal microbe, segmented filamentous bacterium (sfb), is sufficient to induce the appearance of cd4(+) t helper cells that produce il-17 and il-22 (th17 cells) in the lamina propria. sfb adhere tightly to the surface of epithelial cells in the terminal ileum of mice with th17 cells but are absent from mice that have few th17 cells. colonization with sfb was correlated with increased expression of genes associated with inflammation and antimicrobial defenses and resulted in enhanced resistance to the intestinal pathogen citrobacter rodentium. thus, manipulation of this commensal-regulated pathway may provide new opportunities for enhancing mucosal immunity and treating autoimmune disease.
summary polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a common endocrine condition in women of reproductive age, which is associated with a range of metabolic implications. data concerning metabolic features of patients with polycystic ovarian morphology (pom) without any other pcos diagnostic criteria (nonpcos-pom) are limited. in the present study, metabolic profile of 46 women with nonpcos-pom was investigated in comparison with 36 women with pcos d phenotype and control group (n=146). pcos d phenotype was defined according to the european society for human reproduction and embryology/american society for reproductive medicine (eshre/asrm) criteria as irregular anovulatory periods and pom. nonpcos-pom patients in comparison to pcos-d phenotype group showed a significantly lower waist circumference (73.0; 17.0; 99.5; 11.0; p<0.001), a homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (homa-ir) (1.1; 1.0; 12.8; 6.9; p<0.001) and a significantly higher fasting glucose-insulin ratio (fgir) (15.2; 13.0; 5.9; 3.4; p<0.001). there was no significant difference in waist circumference, fgir and homair between the nonpcos-pmo and control group. as neither pcos-d phenotype nor nonpcos-pom patients are characterized by hyperandrogenism, our data suggest that hyperandrogenism is not the only factor contributing to the increased metabolic risk in women with pcos d phenotype. nonpcos-pom patients share a similar metabolic risk profile with the control population and could not be considered as patients with an increased metabolic risk. objective the rotterdam criteria extend the phenotypic spectrum of polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos). we characterized endocrine and metabolic differences among women meeting the national institutes of health (nih) definition for pcos vs two novel phenotypes established by the european society of human reproduction and embryology/american society for reproductive medicine definition.   study design endocrine and metabolic data from a retrospective analysis of 160 age- and weight-matched women with pcos and 23 controls were compared. insulin sensitivity indices were correlated with androgens, gonadotropins, and lipids within each phenotype.   results ovarian and adrenal androgens were highest in the nih-defined pcos group, lowest in the nonhyperandrogenic pcos group, and intermediate in the hyperandrogenic ovulatory pcos population. insulin sensitivity indices, gonadotropins, and lipids were similar across all pcos phenotypes. the magnitude of insulin resistance correlated with free testosterone only in the nih-defined group.   conclusion androgen levels are the major distinguishing endocrine feature differentiating phenotypic expressions of pcos. hyperinsulinemia correlates with free testosterone levels only in traditional nih-defined women with pcos.
although apicomplexans are a widely recognized and important parasitic group, little is known about those associated with invertebrates, such as reef-building scleractinian corals. to resolve the potential impact of apicomplexans on coral health, it is first necessary to further describe this group of putative parasites and determine their prevalence among host species. here, it was hypothesized that apicomplexan prevalence would vary seasonally, similar to what occurs in other marine apicomplexans as well as some coral symbionts. to test this, caribbean scleractinian species porites astreoides, montastraea (=orbicella) annularis, m. (=o.) faveolata, and siderastrea siderea were sampled seasonally from two reefs each in the florida keys and the bahamas for 9- and 5.5-year periods, respectively. utilizing a pcr-based screening assay, apicomplexan dna was detected from most floridian (80.1 %: n = 555/693) and bahamian (90.7 %: n = 311/343) coral tissue samples collected over these multi-year periods. furthermore, apicomplexan dna was detected from nearly all (98.7 %: n = 78/79) single polyps sampled at multiple locations within six m. faveolata colonies, indicating little to no intracolonial variation in the screening assay. mixed-model logistic regression was utilized to determine the effects of season, host species, and reef on apicomplexan prevalence. the model identified a significant seasonal effect, with the highest apicomplexan prevalence occurring during fall. there also was a large effect of host species, with apicomplexan prevalence significantly lower among s. siderea colonies relative to the other species. while reef did not have a significant effect in the full model, there was a significant difference in apicomplexan prevalence between floridian and bahamian reefs for s. siderea, implying regional differences in this host species. despite seasonal and species-specific differences in prevalence, apicomplexans are ubiquitous constituents of these particular scleractinian coral species from florida and the bahamas. this report documents the extent to which coral colonies show fluctuations in their associations with different endosymbiotic dinoflagellates. the genetic identity of symbiodinium from six coral species [acropora palmata (lamarck), a. cervicornis (lamarck), siderastrea siderea (ellis and solander), montastrea faveolata (ellis and solander), m. annularis (ellis and solander), and m. franksi (gregory)] was examined seasonally over five years (1998 and 2000–2004) in the bahamas and florida keys at shallow (1 to 4 m) fore-reef/patch reef sites and at deeper fore-reef (12–15 m) locations. symbionts were identified genetically using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) fingerprinting of the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (its2) of ribosomal rna gene loci. repetitive sampling from most labeled colonies from the bahamas and the florida keys showed little to no change in their dominant symbiont. in contrast, certain colonies of m. annularis and m. franksi from the florida keys exhibited shifts in their associations attributed to recovery from the stresses of the 1997–1998 el niño southern oscillation (enso) event. over several years, a putatively stress-tolerant clade d type of symbiodinium was progressively replaced in these colonies by symbionts typically found in m. annularis and m. franksi in florida and at other caribbean locations. greater environmental fluctuations in florida may explain the observed changes among some of the symbioses. furthermore, symbiotic associations were more heterogeneous at shallow sites, relative to deep sites. the exposure to greater environmental variability near the surface may explain the higher symbiont diversity found within and between host colonies.
dna double‐strand breaks (dsbs) are repaired by two distinct pathways, homologous recombination (hr) and nonhomologous end joining (nhej). nhej includes two pathways, that is, precise and imprecise end joining. we found that lif1, a component of the dna ligase iv complex in saccharomyces cerevisiae, was phosphorylated by cyclin‐dependent kinase (cdk) at ser261 during the s to g2 phase but not during g1 phase. this phosphorylation was required for efficient nhej in g2/m cells, rather than in g1 cells. it also promotes the stable binding of lif1 protein to dsbs, specifically in g2/m‐arrested cells, which shows the resection of dsb ends. thus, lif1 phosphorylation plays a critical role in a certain type of imprecise nhej accompanied by dsb end resection and micro‐homology. lif1 phosphorylation at ser261 is probably involved in micro‐homology‐dependent end joining associated with producing single‐stranded dsb ends that are formed by sae2 as early intermediates in the hr pathway. cdk‐dependent modification of the nhej pathway might make dsb ends compatible for nhej and thus prevent competition between hr and nhej in hierarchy on the choice of dsb repair pathways. the mre11 complex functions in double-strand break (dsb) repair, meiotic recombination, and dna damage checkpoint pathways. sae2 deficiency has opposing effects on the mre11 complex. on one hand, it appears to impair mre11 nuclease function in dna repair and meiotic dsb processing, and on the other, sae2 deficiency activates mre11-complex-dependent dna-damage-signaling via the tel1–mre11 complex (tm) pathway. we demonstrate that sae2 overexpression blocks the tm pathway, suggesting that sae2 antagonizes mre11-complex checkpoint functions. to understand how sae2 regulates the mre11 complex, we screened for sae2 alleles that behaved as the null with respect to mre11-complex checkpoint functions, but left nuclease function intact. phenotypic characterization of these sae2 alleles suggests that sae2 functions as a multimer and influences the substrate specificity of the mre11 nuclease. we show that sae2 oligomerizes independently of dna damage and that oligomerization is required for its regulatory influence on the mre11 nuclease and checkpoint functions.
abstract bacterial pneumonia remains a significant cause of mortality in the united states. the innate immune response is the first line of defense against invading bacteria. neutrophil recruitment to the lungs is the first step in a multistep sequence leading to bacterial clearance. ligand interaction with pattern-recognizing receptors (prrs) leads to chemokine production, which drives neutrophils to the site of infection. although we demonstrated that rip2 is important for host defense in the lungs against escherichia coli, the individual roles of nod1 and nod2 in pulmonary defense have not been addressed. here, we explored the role of nod2 in neutrophil-mediated host defense against an extracellular pathogen, e. coli. we found enhanced bacterial burden and reduced neutrophil and cytokine/chemokine levels in the lungs of nod2−/− mice following e. coli infection. furthermore, we observed reduced activation of nf-κb and mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapks) in the lungs of nod2−/− mice upon e. coli challenge. moreover, nod2−/− neutrophils show impaired intracellular bacterial killing. using nod2/rip2−/− mice, we observed bacterial burden and neutrophil accumulation in the lungs similar to those seen with nod2−/− mice. in addition, bone marrow-derived macrophages obtained from nod2/rip2−/− mice demonstrate a reduction in activation of nf-κb and mapks similar to that seen with nod2−/− mice in response to e. coli. these findings unveil a previously unrecognized role of the nod2-rip2 axis for host defense against extracellular gram-negative bacteria. this pathway may represent a novel target for the treatment of lung infection/inflammation. staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of community-acquired and nosocomial infections including the life-threatening conditions endocarditis, necrotizing pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, and septicemia. toll-like receptor (tlr)-2, a membrane-bound microbial sensor, detects staphylococcal components, but macrophages lacking tlr2 or both tlr2 and tlr4 remain s. aureus responsive, suggesting that an alternative microbial recognition receptor might be involved. the cytoplasmic sensor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing (nod) 2/caspase recruitment domain (card) 15 detects muramyl dipeptide from bacterial peptidoglycans and mediates cytokine responses to s. aureus in vitro, but the physiological significance of these observations is not well defined. here we show that nod2-deficient mice exhibit a delayed but ultimately exacerbated ulcerative response and impaired bacterial clearance after s.c. infection with s. aureus. nod2-dependent recognition of s. aureus and muramyl dipeptide is facilitated by α-toxin (α-hemolysin), a pore-forming toxin and virulence factor of the pathogen. the action of nod2 is dependent on il-1β-amplified production of il-6, which promotes rapid bacterial killing by neutrophils. these results significantly broaden the physiological importance of nod2 in innate immunity from the recognition of bacteria that primarily enter the cytoplasm to the detection of bacteria that typically reside extracellularly and demonstrate that this microbial sensor contributes to the discrimination between commensal bacteria and bacterial pathogens that elaborate pore-forming toxins.
this paper exploits the point of view of constraint programming as computation in a logical system, namely constraint logic. we define the basic ingredients of constraint logic, such as constraint models and generalised polynomials. we show that constraint logic is an institution, and we internalise the study of constraint logic to the framework of category-based equational logic. by showing that constraint logic is a special case of category-based equational logic, we integrate the constraint logic programming paradigm into equational logic programming. results include a herbrand theorem for constraint logic programming characterising herbrand models as initial models in constraint logic. equational deduction is generalised within a category-based abstract model theory framework, and proved complete under a hypothesis of quantifier projectivity, using a semantic treatment that regards quantifiers as models rather than variables, and valuations as model morphisms rather than functions. applications include many- and order-sorted (conditional) equational logics, horn clause logic, equational deduction modulo a theory, constraint logics, and more, as well as any possible combination among them. in the cases of equational deduction modulo a theory and of constraint logic the completeness result is new. one important consequence is an abstract version of herbrand's theorem, which provides an abstract model theoretic foundation for equational and constraint logic programming.
some murine-endogenous retroviruses, making up ∼10 % of the mouse genome, are induced during the course of experimental sepsis in which lipopolysaccharide (lps), a pathogenic component of gram-negative bacteria, often plays a critical role. in this study, we investigated whether lps stress induces the production of murine leukemia virus type-endogenous retrovirus (mulv-erv) virions in primary lymphoid cells. lps treatment of cells (single-cell suspensions and sorted b- and t-cells) isolated from seven lymphoid organs of c57bl/6j mice resulted in a differential increase in the production of mulv-erv virions in most cells examined. interestingly, among the 34 unique mulv-erv u3 sequences cloned from the viral genomic rnas, the nuclear respiratory factor 1 (transcription factor) element was present only in the 20 u3 sequences that were derived from the lps-induced mulv-erv u3 bands. using the u3 sequences as a probe, 55 putative mulv-erv loci were mapped onto the c57bl/6j mouse genome and 15 of them retained full coding potential. furthermore, one full-length recombinant mulv-erv originating from a locus on chromosome 13 was determined to be responsive to lps stress. the findings from this study suggest that lps stress differentially activates mulv-erv virion production in lymphoid organs in a cell type- and mulv-erv-specific manner. further investigation is needed to define the role of mulv-ervs in the lps signalling pathway(s) in general, as well as in the pathogenesis of sepsis. we have determined the 8,332-nucleotide structure of the genome of moloney murine leukaemia virus. the coding frame for the gag gene is the same as that for pol, separated only by a single amber triplet. the pol gene encodes 132,000 daltons of protein, larger than the 70,000 daltons required for the reverse transcriptase. the env gene overlaps the pol gene.
this study investigated differences in kinematic and temporospatial variables in treadmill-naïve dogs when introduced to treadmill trotting and the time required to for them to become habituated to the treadmill. twenty-four healthy labrador retrievers, with an age range of 22-36 months and with no history of orthopaedic disease, were included in the study. a motion capture system registered kinematic variables of the carpus, elbow, tarsus and stifle, along with stride time and stance duration, at 240 hz. six sessions, each lasting 8-10 min, walking and trotting on the treadmill were performed with each dog, with three sessions on each of two consecutive days. the between-stride variability of total angular displacement of the carpus, elbow, stifle and tarsus, as well as the stride and stance time, was higher during the day 1 trotting sessions than in the last session of day 2. these stabilised to non-significant levels before the second session on the second day of measurements and thus habituation was achieved. the current state of canine kinetic and kinematic gait analysis, as developed for the objective description of movement for the study of musculoskeletal disease and lameness, is reviewed. basic terminology of gait is discussed. ground reaction forces, dynamic flexion, and extension angles and angular velocities are described for the canine walk and trot and for lameness in cranial cruciate ligament rupture and canine hip dysplasia.
studies have shown that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) are associated with brain, cardiovascular, and immune function, as well as physical performance and bone health in older adults. so far, few studies have investigated the associations between pufa status and performance-based tests of physical function. the objective of this study was to investigate the associations between the omega-3 pufa levels (eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), docosahexaenoic acid (dha)) in red blood cell (rbc) membranes and physical performance, in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. this is a longitudinal observational study using data from the multidomain alzheimer’s disease trial (mapt), a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. four hundred participants from mapt placebo group with available pufa data were included. omega-3 pufa levels in rbc membranes were measured at baseline, and their percentage of total rbc membrane fatty acid content was calculated. we dichotomized the standardized omega-3 pufa levels in rbc membranes as low (lowest quartile) vs. high (three upper quartiles). gait speed (in m/s) and short physical performance battery (sppb) score (range from 0 to 12, higher is better) were used to assess physical performance at baseline and after 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. participants were 75.2 (± 4.3) years old and 68% were female. bivariate analyses found that the characteristic of the participants in the lowest quartile of omega-3 pufa levels (q1) and those in the three upper quartiles (q2–q4) was not different at baseline; only those in q1 were slightly older. in an unadjusted model, the difference in gait speed after 3 years of follow-up was significant (− 0.09 ± 0.03 m/s; p = 0.008) between participants in q1 and those in q2–q4. in a model adjusted for age, gender, educational level, cognitive function, depressive status, body mass index, physical activity, grip strength, and their time interaction, this difference remained clinically relevant (− 0.07 ± 0.04 m/s; p = 0.075). no difference between the two groups was found for the sppb score development over 3 years. older adults with subjective memory complaints and in the lower quartile of omega-3 have a faster decline on gait speed compared to people in the three upper quartiles. other longitudinal studies are needed to explore this association and to examine mechanisms. the effects of manipulating dietary levels of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids on the function of isolated skeletal muscles in male wistar rats were examined. three isoenergetic diets were used: an essential fatty acid-deficient diet (efad), a diet high in essential (n-6) fatty acids [high (n-6)], and a diet enriched with essential (n-3) fatty acids [high (n-3)]. after 9 wk, groups of rats on each test diet were fed a stock diet of laboratory chow for a further 6 wk. muscle function was examined by using a battery of five tests for soleus (slow twitch) and extensor digitorum longus (edl; fast twitch). tests included single muscle twitches, sustained tetanic contractions, posttetanic potentiation, sustained high-frequency stimulation, and intermittent low-frequency stimulation. results for muscles from the high (n-6) and high (n-3) groups were very similar. however, the efad diet resulted in significantly lower muscular tensions and reduced response times compared with the high (n-6) and high (n-3) diets. peak twitch tension in soleus muscles was 16-21% less in the efad group than in the high (n-6) and high (n-3) groups, respectively [analysis of variance (anova), p < 0.01). during high-frequency stimulation, edl muscles from the efad rats fatigued 32% more quickly (anova, p < 0.01)]. also, twitch contraction and half-relaxation times were significantly 5-7% reduced in the efad group (anova, p < 0.01). during intermittent low-frequency stimulation, soleus muscles from the efad group generated 25-28% less tension than did the other groups (anova, p < 0.01), but in edl muscles from the efad group, endurance was 20% greater than in the high (n-6) group (anova, p < 0.05). after 6 wk on the stock diet, there were no longer any differences between the dietary groups. manipulation of dietary fatty acids results in significant, but reversible, effects in muscles of rats fed an efad diet.
background & aims the pathogenesis of cerebral edema in acute liver failure is suggested, in in vitro and animal studies, to involve a compromised oxidative metabolism with a decrease in cerebral atp levels and an increase in purine concentrations. in this study we hypothesize that the cerebral concentrations of hypoxanthine, inosine, and lactate/pyruvate (lp) ratio are increased and correlated in patients with acute liver failure. furthermore, we expect the purines and l/p ratio to correlate with intracranial pressure (icp) (positively), and cerebral perfusion pressure (cpp) (negatively).   methods in 17 patients (aged 18-60 years) with acute liver failure and severe hyperammonemia (182 ± 36 μm (mean ± sd)), cerebral microdialysis was performed, and icp and cpp were monitored. microdialysate concentrations of hypoxanthine, inosine, lactate, and pyruvate were measured.   results the hypoxanthine concentration was 23.0 ± 12 μm in early samples and 11.7 ± 6.8 μm in late samples (normal level ~2.0 μm). the inosine concentration was 7.2 ± 7.1 μm and 2.8 ± 1.6 μm, and the lp ratio was 55.8 ± 21.6 and 45.6 ± 20.8, respectively (normal level ~18). hypoxanthine correlated significantly to lp ratio (r(2)=0.40, p<0.01) while inosine did not. the purine levels and l/p ratio did not correlate to icp or cpp, nor did they differ between patients with high icp (>20 mmhg, n=9) and patients without (n=8).   conclusions this study shows that the high cerebral lp ratio correlates to the hypoxanthine level in patients with acute liver failure. however, these metabolic alterations were not related to the development of intracranial hypertension. aimhyperammonemia causes brain edema and high intracranial pressure (icp) in acute liver failure (alf) by accumulation of glutamine in brain. since a high-level glutamine may compromise mitochondrial function, the aim of this study was to determine if the lactate–pyruvate ratio is associated with a rise in the glutamine concentration and icp.patients and methodsin 13 patients with alf (8f/5m; median age 46 (range 18–66) years) the cerebral extracellular concentrations of glutamine, lactate, and pyruvate were measured by in vivo brain microdialysis together with icp and cerebral perfusion pressure (cpp).resultsthe cerebral glutamine concentration was 4,396 (1,011–9,712) μm, lactate 2.15 (1.1–4.45) mm, and pyruvate 101 (43–255) μm. the lactate–pyruvate ratio was 21 (16–40), icp 20 (2–28) mmhg, and cpp 72 (56–115) mmhg. cerebral glutamine concentration correlated with the lactate–pyruvate ratio (r = 0.89, p < 0.05). also the icp, but not cpp, correlated to the lactate–pyruvate ratio (r = 0.64, p < 0.05).conclusionicp and the cerebral glutamine concentration in patients with alf correlate to the lactate–pyruvate ratio. since cpp was sufficient in all patients the rise in lactate–pyruvate ratio indicates that accumulation of glutamine compromises mitochondrial function and causes intracranial hypertension.
tungsten alloys (wa) have been introduced in an attempt to find safer alternatives to depleted uranium and lead munitions. however, it is known that at least one alloy, 91% tungsten-6% nickel-3% cobalt (wnc-91-6-3), causes rhabdomyosarcomas when fragments are implanted in rat muscle. this raises concerns that shrapnel, if not surgically removable, may result in similar tumours in humans. there is therefore a clear need to develop rapid and robust in vitro methods to characterise the toxicity of different was in order to identify those that are most likely to be harmful to human health and to guide development of new materials in the future. in the current study we have developed a rapid visual in vitro assay to detect toxicity mediated by individual wa particles in cultured l6-c11 rat muscle cells. using a variety of techniques (histology, comet assay, caspase-3 activity, oxidation of 2'7'-dichlorofluorescin to measure the production of reactive oxygen species and whole-genome microarrays) we show that, in agreement with the in vivo rat carcinogenicity studies, wnc-91-6-3 was the most toxic of the alloys tested. on dissolution, it produces large amounts of reactive oxygen species, causes significant amounts of dna damage, inhibits caspase-3, triggers a severe hypoxic response and kills the cells in the immediate vicinity of the alloy particles within 24h. by combining these in vitro data we offer a mechanistic explanation of the effect of this alloy in vivo and show that in vitro tests are a viable alternative for assessing new alloys in the future. caspases, a family of cysteine proteases most often investigated for their roles in apoptosis, have also been demonstrated to have functions that are vital for the efficient execution of cell differentiation. one such role that has been described is the requirement of caspase-3 for the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts into myotubes but, as yet, the mechanism leading to caspase-3 activation in this case remains elusive. here, we demonstrate that caspase-9, an initiator caspase in the mitochondrial death pathway, is responsible for the activation of caspase-3 in differentiating c2c12 cells. reduction of caspase-9 levels, using an shrna construct, prevented caspase-3 activation and inhibited myoblast fusion. myosin-heavy-chain expression, which accompanies myoblastic differentiation, was not caspase-dependent. overexpression of bcl-xl, a protein that inhibits caspase-9 activation, had the same effect on muscle differentiation as knockdown of caspase-9. these data suggest that the mitochondrial pathway is required for differentiation; however, the release of cytochrome c or smac (diablo) could not be detected, raising the possibility of a novel mechanism of caspase-9 activation during muscle differentiation.
the journal of business research special issue (61/12) covers controversy about formative versus reflective model specification. this essay comments on that special issue and illustrates specific points relating to the controversy by discussing recent studies of business-to-business relationship value, comparing their differing specifications, and noting that the variations of specification result from quite distinct conceptualizations. the essay makes the more substantive conclusion that the differences in conceptualization result from more than one underlying streams of research and that each stream is conceptually quite distinct and needs to follow its own direction for future research. the specific case of relationship value illustrates the broad necessity for researchers to consider in-depth how they conceptualize models. other research areas have distinct research streams that lie behind different conceptualizations and specifications that researchers must nurture explicitly if useful ontology is to develop effectively. during the last years cooperative buyer-seller relationships in industrial markets were more and more discovered as instruments of strategy. while quite a number of publications emphasize the role of the concept of relationship value for the management of cooperative buyer-seller relationships, only very limited empirical research has been done on this topic so far. therefore, this paper describes a large-scale, three-step empirical study that is aimed at conceptualizing and measuring the value of cooperative business relationships from both buyer and supplier perspective using methods of multivariate analysis. results show that benefits and sacrifice may be considered as building blocks of relationship value, with relationship benefits being the main value drivers.
entry of hiv-1 into target cells requires binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein (env) to cellular receptors and subsequent conformational changes that culminates in fusion of viral and target cell membranes. recent structural information has revealed that these conformational transitions are regulated by three conserved but potentially flexible layers stacked between the receptor-binding domain (gp120) and the fusion arm (gp41) of env. we hypothesized that artificial insertion of a covalent bond will ‘snap’ env into a conformation that is less mobile and stably expose conserved sites. therefore, we analyzed the interface between these gp120 layers (layers 1, 2 and 3) and identified residues that may form disulfide bonds when substituted with cysteines. we subsequently probed the structures of the resultant mutant gp120 proteins by assaying their binding to a variety of ligands using surface plasmon resonance (spr) assay. we found that a single disulfide bond strategically inserted between the highly conserved layers 1 and 2 (c65-c115) is able to ‘lock’ gp120 in a cd4 receptor bound conformation (in the absence of cd4), as indicated by the lower dissociation constant (kd) for the cd4-induced (cd4i) epitope binding 17b antibody. when disulfide-stabilized monomeric (gp120) and trimeric (gp140) envs were used to immunize rabbits, they were found to elicit a higher proportion of antibodies directed against both cd4i and cd4 binding site epitopes than the wild-type proteins. these results demonstrate that structure-guided stabilization of inter-layer interactions within hiv-1 env can be used to expose conserved epitopes and potentially overcome the sequence diversity of these molecules. abstract the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 exterior gp120 envelope glycoprotein is highly flexible, and this flexibility may contribute to the inability of monomeric gp120 immunogens to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. we previously showed that an s375w modification of a critical interfacial cavity central to the primary receptor binding site, the phe43 cavity, stabilizes gp120 into the cd4-bound state. however, the immunological effects of this cavity-altering replacement were never tested. subsequently, we screened other mutations that, along with the s375w alteration, might further stabilize the cd4-bound state. here, we define a selected second cavity-altering replacement, t257s, and analyze the double mutations in several gp120 envelope glycoprotein contexts. the gp120 glycoproteins with the t257s-plus-s375w double mutation (t257s+s375w) have a superior antigenic profile compared to the originally identified single s375w replacement in terms of enhanced recognition by the broadly neutralizing cd4 binding-site antibody b12. isothermal titration calorimetry measuring the entropy of the gp120 interaction with cd4 indicated that the double mutant was also stabilized into the cd4-bound state, with increasing relative fixation between core, full-length monomeric, and full-length trimeric versions of gp120. a significant increase in gp120 affinity for cd4 was also observed for the cavity-filling mutants relative to wild-type gp120. the most conformationally constrained t257s+s375w trimeric gp120 proteins were selected for immunogenicity analysis in rabbits and displayed a trend of improvement relative to their wild-type counterparts in terms of eliciting neutralizing antibodies. together, the results suggest that conformational stabilization may improve the ability of gp120 to elicit neutralizing antibodies.
the prevalence of the use of third-party logistics (3pl) providers is noticeable. the complexity of the relationships pertinent to 3pl is greater than that of any traditional logistics supplier relationships. moreover, they can be considered as truly strategic alliances. the use of the mentioned relationships to increase the flexibility of the organization to address the rapid changes occurring in market conditions has become popular while these relationships concentrate on the core competencies as well as the development of long-term growth strategies. a good number of studies have examined the selection of service providers. with respect to the selection of the service providers, the most recent studies approved the better performance of neural networks in comparison with the conventional methods to provide a solution for the real-world engineering problems, one of the sociopolitically inspired optimization strategies named imperialist competitive algorithm (ica) is used. in order to select the 3pl, integration of the support vector regression (svr) and self-adaptive ica (saica) has offered a novel model, in which saica is utilized to adjust the parameters of the svr. the suggested model is applied for cosmetics production. moreover, the comparison of the suggested model and back-propagation neural networks, pure svr, and ica–svr is presented. higher estimation accuracy is achieved as the results of the proposed model reveal, which leads to the effective prediction. a comprehensive look at learning and generalization theory. the statistical theory of learning and generalization concerns the problem of choosing desired functions on the basis of empirical data. highly applicable to a variety of computer science and robotics fields, this book offers lucid coverage of the theory as a whole. presenting a method for determining the necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency of learning process, the author covers function estimates from small data pools, applying these estimations to real-life problems, and much more.
this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of oral tryptophan (trp) supplementation on exercise capacity and metabolic responses in horses. three horses had to perform an exercise test: a 15-min warm-up followed by a 60-min walk (1.7 m/s, w1), a 10-min trot (3.1 m/s, t1), a second 60-min walk (1.7 m/s, w2), a second 10-min trot (3.1 m/s, t2) and a final 30-min walk (1.7 m/s, w3) until the horses were unwilling to continue. the horses exercised on a treadmill at a 6% incline and with a constant draught load of 40 kg (0.44 kn). two hours before exercise horses were given 50 g trp (9.8-10.7 g trp/100 kg bw) by nasogastric tube. a control exercise test was conducted without trp. during the control test, one horse was able to finish the final 30-min walk (w3), whereas two horses finished w3 after trp administration. higher plasma trp levels after trp administration did not change significantly during exercise (trp: start exercise, 524 +/- 41 micromol/l; end exercise 547 +/- 20 micromol/l; control: start exercise, 70 +/- 10 micromol/l; end exercise, 58 +/- 21 micromol/l). after trp supplementation, blood lactate concentrations were significantly lower after the first and second trotting periods. free fatty acids in plasma increased during exercise without any treatment-related differences. although experimental plasma trp levels were seven times higher than the control levels, trp supplementation had no effect on exercise performance and metabolic responses to draught load exercise. it has been hypothesized that fatigue and prolactin (prl) changes during endurance exercise are influenced by serotonin synthesis, and in turn, release. such a change is thought to occur through an increase in blood free tryptophan (trp) and a concomitant decrease in those large neutral amino acids (lnaa) which compete with free trp for entry into the brain. for further investigation, 10 healthy athletes were randomly subjected to three test units (tu), each consisting of a treadmill run for 90 min. the speed was adjusted to a blood lactate level of 2 mmol/l. during the first 30 min of exercise infusions of 500 ml saline (tu i), 500 ml saline with amino acids (tu ii) or 500 ml saline with 30 u heparin/kg following an oral soy oil solution given 1 h before (tu iii) were administered. rate of perceived exertion (rpe), heart rate and running speed were recorded during exercise. venous blood samples were taken after a 10 h fast, at rest, after 10, 50 and 90 min of exercise as well as 10 and 30 min post-exercise. prl, insulin, glucose, ammonia, lactate, triglycerides (tg), free fatty acids (ffa) and amino acids were determined in each sample. no significant differences were found in rpe. prl increased (p < 0.01) in all tu. tg and heparin administration resulted in an increase (p <0.01) in ffa, which correlated (p < 0.01) with free trp and the ratio of free trp/trp. artificial increase in free trp in tu iii did not affect plasma prl level. the amino acid infusion in tu ii induced an increase in lnaa but had no significant effect on prl. prl and ammonia peaked at the end of exercise. we conclude that neither exercise-induced prl secretion nor rpe are affected by changes in circulating free trp and lnaa under the present conditions.
pathways of unfolding a protein depend in principle on the perturbation-whether it is temperature, denaturant, or even forced extension. widely-shared, helical-bundle spectrin repeats are known to melt at temperatures as low as 40-45 degrees c and are also known to unfold via multiple pathways as single molecules in atomic force microscopy. given the varied roles of spectrin family proteins in cell deformability, we sought to determine the coupled effects of temperature on forced unfolding. bimodal distributions of unfolding intervals are seen at all temperatures for the four-repeat beta(1-4) spectrin-an alpha-actinin homolog. the major unfolding length corresponds to unfolding of a single repeat, and a minor peak at twice the length corresponds to tandem repeats. increasing temperature shows fewer tandem events but has no effect on unfolding intervals. as t approaches t(m), however, mean unfolding forces in atomic force microscopy also decrease; and circular dichroism studies demonstrate a nearly proportional decrease of helical content in solution. the results imply a thermal softening of a helical linker between repeats which otherwise propagates a helix-to-coil transition to adjacent repeats. in sum, structural changes with temperature correlate with both single-molecule unfolding forces and shifts in unfolding pathways. using a modified atomic force microscope (afm), individual double-stranded (ds) dna molecules attached to an afm tip and a gold surface were overstretched, and the mechanical stability of the dna double helix was investigated. in lambda-phage dna the previously reported b-s transition at 65 piconewtons (pn) is followed by a second conformational transition, during which the dna double helix melts into two single strands. unlike the b-s transition, the melting transition exhibits a pronounced force-loading-rate dependence and a marked hysteresis, characteristic of a nonequilibrium conformational transition. the kinetics of force-induced melting of the double helix, its reannealing kinetics, as well as the influence of ionic strength, temperature, and dna sequence on the mechanical stability of the double helix were investigated. as expected, the dna double helix is considerably destabilized under low salt buffer conditions (</=10 mm nacl), while high ionic strength buffers (1 m nacl) stabilize the double-helical conformation. the mechanical energy that can be deposited in the dna double helix before force induced melting occurs was found to decrease with increasing temperature. this energy correlates with the base-pairing free enthalpy deltag(bp)(t) of dna. experiments with pure poly(dg-dc) and poly(da-dt) dna sequences again revealed a close correlation between the mechanical energies at which these sequences melt with base pairing free enthalpies deltag(bp)(sequence): while the melting transition occurs between 65 and 200 pn in lambda-phage dna, depending on the loading rate, the melting transition is shifted to approximately 300 pn for poly(dg-dc) dna, whereas poly(da-dt) dna melts at a force of 35 pn.
moringa oleifera lam. is a small tree cultivated throughout india. we have investigated the effect of ethanolic extract of seeds of moringa oleifera (moee, an herbal remedy) on the potential prevention of immune-mediated inflammatory responses in toluene diisocyanate (tdi as antigen)-induced asthma in wistar rats. rats were divided into five different groups (n = 8/group): group-i = unsensitized control; group-ii = tdi control/vehicle; group-iii = dexamethasone (dxm) 2.5 mg/kg; and, groups iv and v = 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg body weight [bw] of moee, respectively. all rats (except unsensitized controls) were sensitized by intranasal application of 10% tdi to induce airway hypersensitivity. animals in groups ii–v were given their respective drug treatment per os from 1 wk prior to initiation of sensitization until the day of final provocation with 5% tdi. after this last challenge, all rats were examined for hyperreactivity symptoms and then sacrificed to determine their total and differential leucocytes in blood and bronchoalveolar (bal) fluid and levels of tnf ∝, il-4, and il-6 in their bal and serum. homogenates of one lung lobe from each animal were utilized to assess oxidative stress; a separate lobe underwent histologic examination to assess airway inflammatory status. the results suggest that asthmatic symptoms were found in tdi control rats only, while both moee- and dxm-treated rats did not manifest any airway abnormality. in moee- and dxm-treated rats, neutrophil and eosinophil levels in the blood were decreased significantly; levels of total cells and each different cell in their bal fluid were markedly decreased as compared to those in tdi controls. tnf α, il-4, and il-6 were predominant in serum as well as in bal fluids in tdi controls, but these levels were reduced significantly by moee treatment. the antioxidant activity in relation to antiinflammatory activity of the extract and histopathological observations also reflected a protective effect. based on the above findings and observations, it can be concluded that moringa oleifera may possess some beneficial properties that act against chemically stimulated immune-mediated inflammatory responses that are characteristic of asthma in the rat. diisocyanates are highly reactive compounds widely used, for example, in the production of polyure-thane foams, elastomers, paints, and adhesives. the high chemical reactivity of these compounds is also reflected in their toxicity: diisocyanates are one of the most important causes of occupational asthma but also other adverse effects, such as irritation and toxic reactions, have been described in exposed subjects. one of the open questions is whether occupational isocyanate exposure is a carcinogenic hazard. the few epidemiological studies available have been based on young cohorts and short follow-up and are not conclusive. toluene diisocyanate (tdi) has been classified as carcinogenic in animals on the basis of gavage administration studies, but no conclusions are available on inhalation exposure. for 4,4′-methylene diphenyldiisocyanate (mdi) there is suggestive evidence for carcinoge-nicity in rats. the possible carcinogenic mechanism of tdi and mdi is not clear. both chemicals have been positive in a number of short-term tests inducing gene mutations and chromosomal damage. the reactive form could be either the diisocyanate itself or may derive from the metabolic activation of the aromatic diamine derivatives formed by hydrolysis. tdi and mdi react with dna in vivo and in vitro. however, the structure of the adducts has not been identified. especially from the in vivo experiment it is not known if the adducts are a product from the reaction with the isocyanate or the corresponding amine. in conclusion, both tdi and mdi are highly reactive chemicals that bind to dna and are probably genotoxic. the alleged animal carcinogenicity of tdi and mdi would suggest that occupational exposure to these compounds is a carcinogenic risk. the few epidemiological studies available have not, however, been able to clarify if tdi and mdi are occupational carcinogens.
aromatase catalyzes the last step in estrogen biosynthesis. brain aromatase is involved in diverse neurophysiological and behavioral functions including sexual behavior, aggression, cognition, and neuroprotection. using positron emission tomography (pet) with the radiolabeled aromatase inhibitor [n‐methyl‐11c]vorozole, we characterized the tracer distribution and kinetics in the living human brain. six young, healthy subjects, three men and three women, were administered the radiotracer alone on two separate occasions. women were scanned in distinct phases of the menstrual cycle. specificity was confirmed by pretreatment with a pharmacological (2.5 mg) dose of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole. pet data were acquired over a 90‐min period and regions of interest placed over selected brain regions. brain and plasma time activity curves, corrected for metabolites, were used to derive kinetic parameters. distribution volume (vt) values in both men and women followed the following rank order: thalamus > amygdala = preoptic area > medulla (inferior olive) > accumbens, pons, occipital and temporal cortex, putamen, cerebellum, and white matter. pretreatment with letrozole reduced vt in all regions, though the size of the reduction was region‐dependent, ranging from ∼70% blocking in thalamus andpreoptic area to ∼10% in cerebellum. the high levels of aromatase in thalamus and medulla (inferior olive) appear to be unique to humans. these studies set the stage forthe noninvasive assessment of aromatase involvement in various physiological and pathological processes affecting the human brain. synapse 64:801–807, 2010. © 2010 wiley‐liss, inc. abstract four rhesus monkeys were surgically implanted with arrays of subcortical electrodes and trained to self-administer rewarding electrical stimulation (icss) to the hypothalamus. in all four animals, concurrent electrical stimulation of the ca3 region of uncal anterior hippocampus or of the cortico-medial region of amygdala inhibited hypothalamic icss. in two of the four animals, concurrent stimulation of the more posterior hippocampus (ca3) facilitated icss. concurrent stimulation of other areas (including basolateral amygdala, hippocampal ca4 region, internal capsule, optic tract, thalamus, and caudate nucleus) had no effect on hypothalamic icss. it is suggested that hypothalamic reinforcement processes may vary according to the parameters of limbic involvement.
backgroundalthough many vector-borne diseases are important causes of morbidity and mortality in dogs in tropical areas and potential zoonoses, there is little information on these conditions in central america.methodsseven qpcrs for vector-borne pathogens were performed on a roche lightcycler pcr instrument to investigate their prevalence in a convenience sample of whole blood samples from apparently healthy dogs in nicaragua. also, a qpcr targeting the canine hydroxymethylbilane synthase (hmbs) gene was used as an endogenous internal control and verified the quality and quantity of dna in the samples was appropriate for the study.resultswe found dna of rickettsia felis (5%), babesia spp. (26%), hepatozoon canis (51%), anaplasma platys (13%) and ehrlichia canis (56%) in the 39 dogs studied. the qpcrs for coxiella burnetii and dirofilaria immitis were negative. of the 30 (80%) dogs that were positive by qpcr, 12 (31%) were positive for one agent, 11 (28%) for two, 3 (8%) for three, and 4 (10%) for four agents.conclusionsthis is the first report of b. gibsoni in dogs from central america and the first recording of vector-borne agents in dogs from nicaragua. dogs in nicaragua are commonly infected with a variety of vector-borne pathogens, some of which may also infect people. two species of hepatozoon are currently known to infect dogs and cause distinct diseases. hepatozoon canis prevalent in africa, asia, southern europe, south america and recently shown to be present also in the usa causes infection mainly of hemolymphoid organs, whereas hepatozoon americanum prevalent in the southeastern usa causes myositis and severe lameness. h. americanum is transmitted by ingestion of the gulf coast tick amblyomma maculatum and also by predation on infected prey. h. canis is transmitted by rhipicephalus sanguineus, in south america also by amblyomma ovale, and has also been shown to be transmitted transplacentally. hepatozoonosis of domestic cats has been described mostly from the same areas where canine infection is present and the exact identity of the species which infect cats, their pathogenicity and vectors have not been elucidated. the diagnosis of hepatozoonosis is made by observation of gamonts in blood smears, histopathology, pcr or serology. the main treatment for h. canis is with imidocarb dipropionate whereas h. americanum infection is treated with an initial combination of trimethoprim-sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine and clindamycin followed by maintenance with decoquinate. treatment for both diseases has not been reported to facilitate complete parasite elimination and new effective drugs are needed for the management of these infections. prevention of hepatozoonosis should be based on avoidance of oral ingestion of infected tick vectors and infected prey.
human cd8 1 memoryand effector-type t cells are poorly defined. we show here that, next to a naive compartment, two discrete primed subpopulations can be found within the circulating human cd8 1 t cell subset. first, cd45ra 2 cd45r0 1 cells are reminiscent of memorytype t cells in that they express elevated levels of cd95 (fas) and the integrin family members cd11a, cd18, cd29, cd49d, and cd49e, compared to naive cd8 1 t cells, and are able to secrete not only interleukin (il) 2 but also interferon g , tumor necrosis factor a , and il-4. this subset does not exert cytolytic activity without prior in vitro stimulation but does contain virus-specific cytotoxic t lymphocyte (ctl) precursors. a second primed population is characterized by cd45ra expression with concomitant absence of expression of the costimulatory molecules cd27 and cd28. the cd8 1 cd45ra 1 cd27 2 population contains t cells expressing high levels of cd11a, cd11b, cd18, and cd49d, whereas cd62l (l-selectin) is not expressed. these t cells do not secrete il-2 or -4 but can produce ifng and tnfa . in accordance with this finding, cells contained within this subpopulation depend for proliferation on exogenous growth factors such as il-2 and -15. interestingly, cd8 1 cd45ra 1 cd27 2 cells parallel effector ctls, as they abundantly express fas-ligand mrna, contain perforin and granzyme b, and have high cytolytic activity without in vitro prestimulation. based on both phenotypic and functional properties, we conclude that memoryand effector-type t cells can be separated as distinct entities within the human cd8 1 t cell subset. cd27, a lymphocyte-specific member of the tnf/ngf-r family, is expressed on the majority of peripheral blood t cells. activation of t cells via tcr/cd3 induces high cd27 surface expression and the release of a soluble extracellular part of the molecule. after prolonged activation in vitro, cd27 becomes gradually switched off. there is evidence that also in vivo, cd4+ cells that have persistently been stimulated by ag, accumulate within the cd45ra-cd27- subset. in addition, an increase of cd27- t cells has been observed under certain immunopathologic conditions and during aging. this study was undertaken to analyze the regulation of cd27 on different t-cell subsets and to determine whether the loss of cd27 expression is an irreversible event and may thereby mark t-cell differentiation. in agreement with earlier findings, all cd4+cd45ra+cd45ro- t cells were found to express cd27, whereas a small fraction of the cd4+cd45ra-cd45ro+ subset lacks the molecule. in contrast, within the cd8+ compartment cd27- subsets were found both in the cd45ra+ and cd45ra- subpopulations. after stimulation with cd3 mab, both cd27 membrane expression and release was equally up-regulated in cd4+ and cd8+ subpopulations. this stimulus, however, provoked a strikingly predominant up-regulation of membrane cd27 on cd45ro- cells as compared with cd45ra- cells. on cd4+cd45ra-cd27- t cells and long-term grown cd45ra-cd27- tlc, cd27 expression could not be reinduced after stimulation of the tcr/cd3 complex, neither at the protein nor at the mrna level. comparison of cd27 expression with its structural homologue fas/apo-1 showed that down-regulation after prolonged activation is not a general feature of tnf/ngf-r family members. the cd27 ligand was recently identified and was shown to give a co-stimulatory signal to pha-activated t cells. the restricted up-regulation of cd27 on cd45ra+ cells after t-cell stimulation may point at a discrete role of cd27-cd27 ligand interaction during transition of cd45ro- to cd45ra- t cells. in addition, the cd27 negative phenotype seems a stable reflection of differentiation rather than of activation.
homologous recombination requires nucleolytic degradation (resection) of dna double‐strand break (dsb) ends. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mrx complex and sae2 are involved in the onset of dsb resection, whereas extensive resection requires exo1 and the concerted action of dna2 and sgs1. here, we show that the checkpoint protein rad9 limits the action of sgs1/dna2 in dsb resection by inhibiting sgs1 binding/persistence at the dsb ends. when inhibition by rad9 is abolished by the sgs1‐ss mutant variant or by deletion of rad9, the requirement for sae2 and functional mrx in dsb resection is reduced. these results provide new insights into how early and long‐range resection is coordinated. abstract the mre11 complex is a central component of the dna damage response, with roles in damage sensing, molecular bridging, and end resection. we have previously shown that in saccharomyces cerevisiae, ku70 (yku70) deficiency reduces the ionizing radiation sensitivity of mre11δ mutants. in this study, we show that yku70 deficiency suppressed the camptothecin (cpt) and methyl methanesulfonate (mms) sensitivity of nuclease-deficient mre11-3 and sae2δ mutants in an exo1-dependent manner. cpt-induced g2/m arrest, γ-h2ax persistence, and chromosome breaks were elevated in mre11-3 mutants. these outcomes were reduced by yku70 deficiency. given that the genotoxic effects of cpt are manifest during dna replication, these data suggest that ku limits exo1-dependent double-strand break (dsb) resection during dna replication, inhibiting the initial processing steps required for homology-directed repair. we propose that mre11 nuclease- and sae2-dependent dna end processing, which initiates dsb resection prevents ku from engaging dsbs, thus promoting exo1-dependent resection. in agreement with this idea, we show that ku affinity for binding to short single-stranded overhangs is much lower than for blunt dna ends. collectively, the data define a nonhomologous end joining (nhej)-independent, s-phase-specific function of the ku heterodimer.
sophie boisson and colleagues conducted a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial in orissa, a state in southeast india, to evaluate the effect of household water treatment in preventing diarrheal illnesses in children aged under five years of age. please see later in the article for the editors' summary abstract background diarrhoea is a major cause of death and disease, especially among young children in low‐income countries. in these settings, many infectious agents associated with diarrhoea are spread through water contaminated with faeces. in remote and low‐income settings, source‐based water quality improvement includes providing protected groundwater (springs, wells, and bore holes), or harvested rainwater as an alternative to surface sources (rivers and lakes). point‐of‐use water quality improvement interventions include boiling, chlorination, flocculation, filtration, or solar disinfection, mainly conducted at home. objectives to assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve water quality for preventing diarrhoea. search methods we searched the cochrane infectious diseases group specialized register (11 november 2014), central (the cochrane library, 7 november 2014), medline (1966 to 10 november 2014), embase (1974 to 10 november 2014), and lilacs (1982 to 7 november 2014). we also handsearched relevant conference proceedings, contacted researchers and organizations working in the field, and checked references from identified studies through 11 november 2014. selection criteria randomized controlled trials (rcts), quasi‐rcts, and controlled before‐and‐after studies (cba) comparing interventions aimed at improving the microbiological quality of drinking water with no intervention in children and adults. data collection and analysis two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. we used meta‐analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect, where appropriate, and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses. we assessed the quality of evidence using the grade approach. main results forty‐five cluster‐rcts, two quasi‐rcts, and eight cba studies, including over 84,000 participants, met the inclusion criteria. most included studies were conducted in low‐ or middle‐income countries (lmics) (50 studies) with unimproved water sources (30 studies) and unimproved or unclear sanitation (34 studies). the primary outcome in most studies was self‐reported diarrhoea, which is at high risk of bias due to the lack of blinding in over 80% of the included studies. source‐based water quality improvements there is currently insufficient evidence to know if source‐based improvements such as protected wells, communal tap stands, or chlorination/filtration of community sources consistently reduce diarrhoea (one cluster‐rct, five cba studies, very low quality evidence). we found no studies evaluating reliable piped‐in water supplies delivered to households. point‐of‐use water quality interventions on average, distributing water disinfection products for use at the household level may reduce diarrhoea by around one quarter (home chlorination products: rr 0.77, 95% ci 0.65 to 0.91; 14 trials, 30,746 participants, low quality evidence; flocculation and disinfection sachets: rr 0.69, 95% ci 0.58 to 0.82, four trials, 11,788 participants, moderate quality evidence). however, there was substantial heterogeneity in the size of the effect estimates between individual studies. point‐of‐use filtration systems probably reduce diarrhoea by around a half (rr 0.48, 95% ci 0.38 to 0.59, 18 trials, 15,582 participants, moderate quality evidence). important reductions in diarrhoea episodes were shown with ceramic filters, biosand systems and lifestraw® filters; (ceramic: rr 0.39, 95% ci 0.28 to 0.53; eight trials, 5763 participants, moderate quality evidence; biosand: rr 0.47, 95% ci 0.39 to 0.57; four trials, 5504 participants, moderate quality evidence; lifestraw®: rr 0.69, 95% ci 0.51 to 0.93; three trials, 3259 participants, low quality evidence). plumbed in filters have only been evaluated in high‐income settings (rr 0.81, 95% ci 0.71 to 0.94, three trials, 1056 participants, fixed effects model). in low‐income settings, solar water disinfection (sodis) by distribution of plastic bottles with instructions to leave filled bottles in direct sunlight for at least six hours before drinking probably reduces diarrhoea by around a third (rr 0.62, 95% ci 0.42 to 0.94; four trials, 3460 participants, moderate quality evidence). in subgroup analyses, larger effects were seen in trials with higher adherence, and trials that provided a safe storage container. in most cases, the reduction in diarrhoea shown in the studies was evident in settings with improved and unimproved water sources and sanitation. authors' conclusions interventions that address the microbial contamination of water at the point‐of‐use may be important interim measures to improve drinking water quality until homes can be reached with safe, reliable, piped‐in water connections. the average estimates of effect for each individual point‐of‐use intervention generally show important effects. comparisons between these estimates do not provide evidence of superiority of one intervention over another, as such comparisons are confounded by the study setting, design, and population. further studies assessing the effects of household connections and chlorination at the point of delivery will help improve our knowledge base. as evidence suggests effectiveness improves with adherence, studies assessing programmatic approaches to optimising coverage and long‐term utilization of these interventions among vulnerable populations could also help strategies to improve health outcomes. 16 april 2019 update pending studies awaiting assessment the cidg is currently examining a new search conducted in april 2019 for potentially relevant studies. these studies have not yet been incorporated into this cochrane review.
more than 80% of human ovarian cancers express lhrh and its receptor as part of a negative autocrine mechanism of growth control. this study was conducted to investigate whether lhrh affects apoptosis in ovarian cancer. efo-21 and efo-27 ovarian cancer cells were treated with lhrh agonist triptorelin or with cytotoxic agent doxorubicin in the absence or presence of triptorelin. apoptotic cells were quantified by flow cytometry. expression of nuclear factor kappa b (nfkb) was assessed by rt-pcr and immunoblotting. for determination of triptorelin-induced nfkb activation, cells were transfected with a nfkb-secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter gene plasmid (pnfkb-seap) and cultured for 96 h with or without triptorelin. the causal relation between triptorelin-induced nfkb activation and triptorelin-induced protection against apoptosis was investigated using sn50, an inhibitor for nuclear translocation of activated nfkb. apoptosis induction by triptorelin was never observed. treatment with doxorubicin (1 nmol/l) for 72 h increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in efo-21 and efo-27 ovarian cancer cell lines to 31% or 34%, respectively. in cultures treated simultaneously with triptorelin (100 nmol/l), the percentage of apoptotic cells was reduced significantly, to 17% or 18%, respectively (p , 0.001). rt-pcr and immunoblotting experiments showed that nfkb subunits p50 and p65 were expressed by ovarian cancer cell lines efo-21 and efo-27. when efo-21 or efo-27 cells were transfected with pnfkb-seap and subsequently treated with triptorelin (100 nmol/l), nfkbinduced seap expression increased 5.3-fold or 4.7-fold, respectively (p , 0.001). triptorelin-induced reduction of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was blocked by sn50-mediated inhibition of nfkb translocation into the nucleus. we conclude that lhrh induces activation of nfkb and thus reduces doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells. this possibility to protect ovarian cancer cells from programmed cell death is an important feature in lhrh signaling in ovarian tumors, apart from the inhibitory interference with the mitogenic pathway. (j clin endocrinol metab 85: 3815–3820, 2000) i a series of recent studies, it could be demonstrated that ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors of these organs express lhrh immunoand bioactivity, as well as the messenger rna (mrna) for lhrh (1–4). in addition, specific high-affinity binding sites for lhrh and the expression of the mrna for the pituitary lhrh receptor have been detected in ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancer cell lines and in over 80% (ovarian and endometrial cancers) or 50% (breast cancer) of biopsy specimens of these cancers, suggesting the existence of some components essential for a local regulatory system based on lhrh (5). several groups provided evidence that the in vitro proliferation of a variety of human ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancer cell lines can be inhibited by agonistic and/or antagonistic analogs of lhrh in a doseand time-dependent manner (2, 6–9). comparable data were obtained in human prostate cancer (10). the function of the expression of lhrh and its receptor in human cancers has been the subject of intensive research. in view of the apparent similarity of lhrh receptors in ovarian cancers to those in the pituitary, it seemed reasonable to speculate that lhrh signal transduction pathways in tumors might be identical to those operating in pituitary gonadotrophs (11). our findings, however, suggest that the classical lhrh receptor signal transduction pathways, known from pituitary gonadotrophs, such as phospholipase c or protein kinase c (11), are not involved in the mediation of antiproliferative effects of lhrh analogs in ovarian and endometrial cancer cells (12). lhrh analogs, rather, interfere with the mitogenic signal transduction pathway of growth factor receptors and related oncogene products associated with tyrosine kinase activity (5, 12). the mechanism of action is probably an lhrh-induced activation of a tyrosine phosphatase, counteracting the effects of receptor protein tyrosine kinase (5, 12). a comparable mechanism was detected in human prostate cancer cells (13). imai et al. (14) suggested that lhrh-induced antiproliferative activity might be additionally mediated by stimulation of apoptotic cell death. however, in pilot experiments, we could not detect any signs of apoptosis induction by lhrh agonists or antagonists. in contrast to that, we found an antiapoptotic influence of lhrh agonists in control experiments, using cytotoxic agent doxorubicin, a well established inductor of apoptosis. looking for possible mechanisms that might be able to mediate this antiapoptotic effect, we regarded nuclear factor kb (nfkb) to be an interesting we report here the purification and cdna cloning of apaf-1, a novel 130 kd protein from hela cell cytosol that participates in the cytochrome c-dependent activation of caspase-3. the nh2-terminal 85 amino acids of apaf-1 show 21% identity and 53% similarity to the nh2-terminal prodomain of the caenorhabditis elegans caspase, ced-3. this is followed by 320 amino acids that show 22% identity and 48% similarity to ced-4, a protein that is believed to initiate apoptosis in c. elegans. the cooh-terminal region of apaf-1 comprises multiple wd repeats, which are proposed to mediate protein-protein interactions. cytochrome c binds to apaf-1, an event that may trigger the activation of caspase-3, leading to apoptosis.
objective: we aimed to determine the pharmacokinetics (pk) of n-acetylcysteine (nac) at rest and during exercise when given by continuous intravenous infusion intended to maintain relatively constant plasma concentrations. methods: plasma concentrations of nac were measured in 24 healthy male subjects during and after a two-stage intravenous infusion designed to provide constant nac concentrations during cycling exercise, including intense exercise to fatigue. results: a three-compartment, open pk model was the best fit using population pk analysis with nonmem. whole-body clearance (cl) was 0.58 l kg−1 h−1 (95% ci 0.44–0.72) for reduced nac (nacr) and 0.16 (0.13–0.20) l kg−1 h−1 for total nac (nact). the central volume of distribution (v1) was 0.064 (0.008–0.12) l kg−1 for nacr and 0.037 (0.02–0.06) l kg−1 for nact. exercise was a significant covariate in the model, resulting in a 25 and 23% reduction in cl of nacr and nact, respectively. v1 in our subjects was smaller than expected, resulting in higher-than-anticipated initial concentrations of nac. despite these findings, the incidence of adverse effects attributable to nac was minimal without using prophylactic or concomitant drug therapy. conclusions: nac can be given to healthy exercising men by intravenous infusion and to the plasma concentrations seen in this study with minimal adverse effects due to the drug. the pk parameters of nac at rest in volunteers are consistent with previously reported values and are significantly altered by vigorous cycling exercise. the production of reactive oxygen species in skeletal muscle is linked with muscle fatigue. this study investigated whether the antioxidant compound n-acetylcysteine (nac) augments time to fatigue during prolonged, submaximal cycling exercise. seven men completed a double-blind, crossover study, receiving nac or placebo before and during cycling exercise, comprising 45 min at 70% of peak oxygen consumption (vo2 peak) and then to fatigue at 90% vo2 peak. nac was intravenously infused at 125 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 15 min and then 25 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 20 min before and throughout exercise, which was continued until fatigue. arterialized venous blood was analyzed for nac concentration, hematology, and plasma electrolytes. nac induced no serious adverse reactions and did not affect hematology, acid-base status, or plasma electrolytes. time to fatigue was reproducible in preliminary trials (coefficient of variation 7.4 +/- 1.2%) and was not augmented by nac (nac 14.6 +/- 4.5 min; control 12.8 +/- 5.4 min). however, time to fatigue during nac trials was correlated with vo2 peak (r = 0.78; p < 0.05), suggesting that nac effects on performance may be dependent on training status. the rise in plasma k+ concentration at fatigue was attenuated by nac (p < 0.05). the ratio of rise in k+ concentration to work and the percentage change in time to fatigue tended to be inversely related (r = -0.71; p < 0.07). further research is required to clarify a possible training status-dependent effect of nac on muscle performance and k+ regulation.
carotenoids have been identified in the fungus podospora anserina and a parallel pathway to neurosporene and β-carotene was established. three genes for the β-carotene branch have been cloned and their function elucidated. they correspond to the al-1, al-2 and al-3 genes from neurospora crassa. they were individually and in combinations over-expressed in p. anserina in order to modify the carotenoid composition qualitatively and quantitatively. in the resulting transformants, carotenoid synthesis was up to eightfold increased and several intermediates of the pathway together with special cyclic carotenoids, β-zeacarotene and 7,8-dihydro-β-carotene, accumulated. all transformants with an over-expressed al-2 gene (encoding a phytoene synthase and a lycopene cyclase) displayed up to 31% prolonged life span. backgroundthe dung-inhabiting ascomycete fungus podospora anserina is a model used to study various aspects of eukaryotic and fungal biology, such as ageing, prions and sexual development.resultswe present a 10x draft sequence of p. anserina genome, linked to the sequences of a large expressed sequence tag collection. similar to higher eukaryotes, the p. anserina transcription/splicing machinery generates numerous non-conventional transcripts. comparison of the p. anserina genome and orthologous gene set with the one of its close relatives, neurospora crassa, shows that synteny is poorly conserved, the main result of evolution being gene shuffling in the same chromosome. the p. anserina genome contains fewer repeated sequences and has evolved new genes by duplication since its separation from n. crassa, despite the presence of the repeat induced point mutation mechanism that mutates duplicated sequences. we also provide evidence that frequent gene loss took place in the lineages leading to p. anserina and n. crassa. p. anserina contains a large and highly specialized set of genes involved in utilization of natural carbon sources commonly found in its natural biotope. it includes genes potentially involved in lignin degradation and efficient cellulose breakdown.conclusionthe features of the p. anserina genome indicate a highly dynamic evolution since the divergence of p. anserina and n. crassa, leading to the ability of the former to use specific complex carbon sources that match its needs in its natural biotope.
to study the genetic variability and the genetic basis of nitrogen (n) use efficiency in maize, a set of recombinant inbred lines crossed with a tester was studied at low input (n-) and high input (n+) for grain yield and its components, grain protein content, and post-anthesis nitrogen uptake and remobilization. other physiological traits, such as nitrate content, nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase (gs), and glutamate dehydrogenase activities were studied at the level of the lines. genotypexnitrogen (gxn) interaction was significant for yield and explained by variation in kernel number. in n-, n-uptake, the nitrogen nutrition index, and gs activity in the vegetative stage were positively correlated with grain yield, whereas leaf senescence was negatively correlated. whatever n-input, post-anthesis n-uptake was highly negatively related to n-remobilization. as a whole, genetic variability was expressed differently in n+ and n-. this was confirmed by the detection of qtls. more qtls were detected in n+ than in n- for traits of vegetative development, n-uptake, and grain yield and its components, whereas it was the reverse for grain protein content and n-utilization efficiency. several coincidences between genes encoding for enzymes of n metabolism and qtls for the traits studied were observed. in particular, coincidences in three chromosome regions of qtls for yield and n-remobilization, qtls for gs activity and a gene encoding cytosolic gs were observed. this may have a physiological meaning. the gs locus on chromosome 5 appears to be a good candidate gene which can, at least partially, explain the variation in nitrogen use efficiency. a full-length cdna clone, pmgdh1, encoding maize nadh-glutamate dehydrogenase (nadh-gdh) was isolated from a maize root cdna library. the identity of the cdna was established by the coincidence of the structure of the purified protein with that inferred from the nucleotide sequence of the cdna. pmgdh1 had a cdna insert of 1,638 bp and the open reading frame encoded 411 amino acid residues. the deduced amino acid sequence was similar to putative partial sequences of gdhs from higher plants and to the sequences of gdhs from organisms as diverse as mammals and bacteria. the nh2-terminal sequence deduced from the open reading frame had a typical structure that is associated with the import of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix. the cdna hybridized to an rna of about 1.6 kb. this transcript was more abundant in roots than in leaves and was localized in the bundle sheath cells in leaf tissues. analysis of genomic dna by southern hybridization suggested the existence of gene(s) for another nadh-gdh subunit(s).
abstract hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) regulates satellite cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. we analyzed the dose-dependent effects of hgf on myogenesis. murine c2c12 and human donor-derived skeletal muscle myoblasts were treated with 0, 2, or 10 ng/ml hgf followed by assessment of proliferation and differentiation. hgf (2 ng/ml) significantly promoted cell division, but reduced myogenic commitment and fusion. conversely, 10 ng/ml hgf reduced proliferative capability, but increased differentiation. c-met expression analysis revealed significantly decreased expression in differentiating cells cultured with 2 ng/ml hgf, but increased expression in proliferating cells with 10 ng/ml hgf. mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapks: erk, jnk, or p38k) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi3k) inhibition abrogated the hgf-stimulated increase in cell number. interestingly, pi3k and p38 kinase facilitated the negative effect of hgf on proliferation, while erk inhibition abrogated the hgf-mediated decrease in differentiation. dose-dependent effects of hgf are mediated by changes in c-met expression and downstream mapk and pi3k signalling. skeletal muscle growth and regeneration are attributed to satellite cells - muscle stem cells resident beneath the basal lamina that surrounds each myofibre. quiescent satellite cells express the transcription factor pax7 and when activated, coexpress pax7 with myod. most then proliferate, downregulate pax7 and differentiate. by contrast, others maintain pax7 but lose myod and return to a state resembling quiescence. here we show that pax7 is able to drive transcription in quiescent and activated satellite cells, and continues to do so in those cells that subsequently cease proliferation and withdraw from immediate differentiation. we found that constitutive expression of pax7 in satellite-cell-derived myoblasts did not affect myod expression or proliferation. although maintained expression of pax7 delayed the onset of myogenin expression it did not prevent, and was compatible with, myogenic differentiation. constitutive pax7 expression in a pax7-null c2c12 subclone increased the proportion of cells expressing myod, showing that pax7 can act genetically upstream of myod. however these pax7-null cells were unable to differentiate into normal myotubes in the presence of pax7. therefore pax7 may be involved in maintaining proliferation and preventing precocious differentiation, but does not promote quiescence.
atomicity is a fundamental property to guarantee the isolation of a work unit (i.e., a sequence of related events in a thread) from concurrent threads. however, ensuring atomicity is often very challenging due to complex thread interactions. we present an approach to help developers verify whether such work units, which have triggered bugs due to certain violations of atomicity, are sufficiently synchronized or not by locks introduced for fixing the bugs. a key feature of our approach is that it combines the fortes of both bug-driven and change-aware techniques, which enables it to effectively verify synchronizations by testing only a minimal set of suspicious atomicity violations without any knowledge on the to-be-isolated work units, thus being more efficient and practical than other approaches. besides, unlike existing approaches, our approach effectively utilizes all the inferred execution traces even they may not be completely feasible, such that the verification algorithm can converge much faster. we demonstrate via extensive evaluation that our approach is much more effective and efficient than the state-of-the-arts. besides, we show that although there have existed sound automatic fixing techniques for atomicity violations, our approach is still necessary and useful for quality assurance of concurrent programs, because the assumption behind our approach is much weaker. we have also investigated one of the largest bug databases and found that insufficient synchronizations are common and difficult to be found in software development. fixing software bugs has always been an important and time-consuming process in software development. fixing concurrency bugs has become especially critical in the multicore era. however, fixing concurrency bugs is challenging, in part due to non-deterministic failures and tricky parallel reasoning. beyond correctly fixing the original problem in the software, a good patch should also avoid introducing new bugs, degrading performance unnecessarily, or damaging software readability. existing tools cannot automate the whole fixing process and provide good-quality patches.  we present afix, a tool that automates the whole process of fixing one common type of concurrency bug: single-variable atomicity violations. afix starts from the bug reports of existing bug-detection tools. it augments these with static analysis to construct a suitable patch for each bug report. it further tries to combine the patches of multiple bugs for better performance and code readability. finally, afix's run-time component provides testing customized for each patch. our evaluation shows that patches automatically generated by afix correctly eliminate six out of eight real-world bugs and significantly decrease the failure probability in the other two cases. afix patches never introduce new bugs and usually have similar performance to manually-designed patches.
many benefits could be obtained by bringing together sources of knowledge so that information could be shared and greater understanding generated. the kraft project1 is investigating the re‐use and fusion of constraint‐based knowledge in particular. this paper describes the approach being taken by the project and examines the ontological structures involved. the kraft project aims to investigate how a distributed architecture can support the transformation and reuse of a particular class of knowledge, namely constraints, and to fuse this knowledge so as to gain added value, by using it for constraint solving or data retrieval.
ischemic preconditioning is known to protect the myocardium from ischemia-reperfusion injury. we examined the transmural release of bradykinin during myocardial ischemia and the influence of ischemic preconditioning on bradykinin release during subsequent myocardial ischemia. myocardial ischemia was induced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in anesthetized cats. cardiac microdialysis was performed by implantation and perfusion of dialysis probes in the epicardium and endocardium. in eight animals, bradykinin release was greater in the endocardium than in the epicardium (14.4 +/- 2.8 vs. 7.3 +/- 1.7 ng/ml, p < 0.05) during 30 min of ischemia. in seven animals subjected to preconditioning, myocardial bradykinin release was potentiated significantly from 2.4 +/- 0.6 ng/ml during the control period to 23.1 +/- 2.5 ng/ml during 30 min of myocardial ischemia compared with the non-preconditioning group (from 2.7 +/- 0.6 to 13.4 +/- 1.9 ng/ml, p < 0.05, n = 6). thus this study provides further evidence that transmural gradients of bradykinin are produced during ischemia. the results also suggest that ischemic preconditioning enhances bradykinin release in the myocardial interstitial fluid during subsequent ischemia, which is likely one of the mechanisms of cardioprotection of ischemic preconditioning. ischemic preconditioning is a phenomenon in which exposure of the heart to a brief period of ischemia causes it to quickly adapt itself to become resistant to infarction from a subsequent ischemic insult. the mechanism is not fully understood but, at least in the rabbit, it is known to be triggered by occupation of adenosine receptors, opioid receptors, bradykinin receptors and the generation of free radicals during the preconditioning ischemia. all of these are thought to converge on and activate protein kinase c (pkc), which in turn activates a tyrosine kinase. this kinase cascade eventually terminates on some unknown effector, possibly a potassium channel or a cytoskeletal protein, which makes the cells resistant to infarction. if this process can be understood, it should be possible to devise a method for conferring this protection to patients with acute myocardial infarction.
during the angiosperm (flowering-plant) life cycle, double fertilization represents the hallmark between diploid and haploid generations [1]. the success of double fertilization largely depends on compatible communication between the male gametophyte (pollen tube) and the maternal tissues of the flower, culminating in precise pollen tube guidance to the female gametophyte (embryo sac) and its rupture to release sperm cells. several important factors involved in the pollen tube reception have been identified recently [2-6], but the underlying signaling pathways are far from being understood. here, we report that a group of female-specific small proteins, early nodulin-like proteins (enodls, or ens), are required for pollen tube reception. ens are featured with a plastocyanin-like (pcnl) domain, an arabinogalactan (ag) glycomodule, and a predicted glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) anchor motif. we show that ens are asymmetrically distributed at the plasma membrane of the synergid cells and accumulate at the filiform apparatus, where arriving pollen tubes communicate with the embryo sac. en14 strongly and specifically interacts with the extracellular domain of the receptor-like kinase feronia, localized at the synergid cell surface and known to critically control pollen tube reception [6]. wild-type pollen tubes failed to arrest growth and to rupture after entering the ovules of quintuple loss-of-function en mutants, indicating a central role of ens in male-female communication and pollen tube reception. moreover, overexpression of en15 by the endogenous promoter caused disturbed pollen tube guidance and reduced fertility. these data suggest that female-derived gpi-anchored enodls play an essential role in male-female communication and fertilization. enod40 is one of the genes associated with legume nodule development and has a putative role in general plant organogenesis. we have isolated a small enod40 gene family from white clover (trifolium repens), with three genes designated trenod40-1, trenod40-2, and trenod40-3, all containing the conserved enod40 regions i and ii. trenod40-1 and trenod40-2 share over 90% homology in the transcribed regions and high levels of similarity in their upstream regulatory sequences. trenod40-1 and trenod40-2 are similar to the enod40 genes of legumes forming indeterminate nodules (group ii) and are predominantly expressed in nodules. trenod40-3 shares only 32.8% identity with trenod40-1 and trenod40-2 within the transcribed region. trenod40-3 is similar to the enod40 genes of legumes with determinate nodules (group i) and is not predominantly expressed in nodules. to our knowledge, this is the first report of both group iand group ii-type enod40 genes being expressed in a single legume species. in situ hybridization studies revealed that trenod40 genes were highly expressed in non-symbiotic tissues, particularly in stolon nodes during nodal root and lateral shoot development. high levels of trenod40 transcripts were also present in the vascular bundles of mature plant organs, mainly at sites of intensive lateral transport, suggesting a role in vascular tissue function. the expression pattern of trenod40 genes was analyzed further using trenod40 promoter-gus fusions in transgenic white clover and tobacco (nicotiana tabacum), indicating that white clover and tobacco share the regulatory mechanisms for trenod40-1/2 promoters and some aspects of trenod40-3 regulation.
overexpression of the ped/pea-15 protein in muscle and adipose cells increases glucose transport and impairs further insulin induction. like glucose transport, protein kinase c (pkc)-a and -b are also constitutively activated and are not further stimulatable by insulin in l6 skeletal muscle cells overexpressing ped (l6ped). pkc-z features no basal change but completely loses insulin sensitivity in l6ped. in these cells, blockage of pkc-a and -b additively returns 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2dg) uptake to the levels of cells expressing only endogenous ped (l6wt). blockage of pkc-a and -b also restores insulin activation of pkc-z in l6ped cells, with that of pkc-a sixfold more effective than pkc-b. similar effects on 2-dg uptake and pkc-z were also achieved by 50-fold overexpression of pkc-z in l6ped. in l6wt, fivefold overexpression of pkc-a or -b increases basal 2-dg uptake and impairs further insulin induction with no effect on insulin receptor or insulin receptor substrate phosphorylation. in these cells, overexpression of pkc-a blocks insulin induction of pkc-z activity. pkc-b is 10-fold less effective than pkc-a in inhibiting pkc-z stimulation. expression of the dominant-negative k3w pkc-z mutant simultaneously inhibits insulin activation of pkc-z and 2-dg uptake in the l6wt cells. we conclude that activation of classic pkcs, mainly pkc-a, inhibits pkc-z and may mediate the action of ped on glucose uptake in l6 skeletal muscle cells. diabetes 50:1244–1252, 2001 we have used differential display to identify genes whose expression is altered in type 2 diabetes thus contributing to its pathogenesis. one mrna is overexpressed in fibroblasts from type 2 diabetics compared with non‐diabetic individuals, as well as in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues, two major sites of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. the levels of the protein encoded by this mrna are also elevated in type 2 diabetic tissues; thus, we named it ped for phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes. ped cloning shows that it encodes a 15 kda phosphoprotein identical to the protein kinase c (pkc) substrate pea‐15. the ped gene maps on human chromosome 1q21–22. transfection of ped/pea‐15 in differentiating l6 skeletal muscle cells increases the content of glut1 transporters on the plasma membrane and inhibits insulin‐stimulated glucose transport and cell‐surface recruitment of glut4, the major insulin‐sensitive glucose transporter. these effects of ped overexpression are reversed by blocking pkc activity. overexpression of the ped/pea‐15 gene may contribute to insulin resistance in glucose uptake in type 2 diabetes.
introduction and hypothesispelvic floor disorders affect many women in high-income countries. since little is known about such disorders in africa, this study aimed at assessing the prevalence and risk factors in an ethiopian community. we also assessed the validity of a prolapse questionnaire.methodsa community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 395 women, recruited by a systematic random sampling technique. women were interviewed about symptoms of urinary incontinence, faecal incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse by female nurses. additionally, pelvic examinations were performed in 294 (74.2 %) participants to assess anatomical prolapse using the simplified pelvic organ prolapse quantification staging system. descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were employed.resultsthe median age of participants was 35.0 years. thirty-one women reported urinary incontinence (7.8 %), 25 (6.3 %) symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse and 2 (0.5 %) faecal incontinence. anatomical pelvic organ prolapse stage ii–iv was detected in 162 (55.1 %) of women who underwent pelvic examination. the questionnaire for prolapse assessment had poor validity (38.3 % sensitivity and 95.4 % specificity) even in cases of clinically relevant prolapse (stage iii or iv). after adjustment, carrying heavy objects for 5 or more hours a day, history of prolonged labour and highland rural residence were associated with anatomical pelvic organ prolapse.conclusionsself-reported incontinence seems low in northwest ethiopia. the prevalence of symptomatic prolapse was low despite a high prevalence of prolapse signs. notably, heavy carrying and prolonged labour increased the risk of anatomical prolapse stage ii–iv. the methods of assessing pelvic floor disorders in a low-income context need further development. context pelvic floor disorders (urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse) affect many women. no national prevalence estimates derived from the same population-based sample exists for multiple pelvic floor disorders in women in the united states.   objective to provide national prevalence estimates of symptomatic pelvic floor disorders in us women.   design, setting, and participants a cross-sectional analysis of 1961 nonpregnant women (>or=20 years) who participated in the 2005-2006 national health and nutrition examination survey, a nationally representative survey of the us noninstitutionalized population. women were interviewed in their homes and then underwent standardized physical examinations in a mobile examination center. urinary incontinence (score of >or=3 on a validated incontinence severity index, constituting moderate to severe leakage), fecal incontinence (at least monthly leakage of solid, liquid, or mucous stool), and pelvic organ prolapse (seeing/feeling a bulge in or outside the vagina) symptoms were assessed.   main outcome measures weighted prevalence estimates of urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse symptoms.   results the weighted prevalence of at least 1 pelvic floor disorder was 23.7% (95% confidence interval [ci], 21.2%-26.2%), with 15.7% of women (95% ci, 13.2%-18.2%) experiencing urinary incontinence, 9.0% of women (95% ci, 7.3%-10.7%) experiencing fecal incontinence, and 2.9% of women (95% ci, 2.1%-3.7%) experiencing pelvic organ prolapse. the proportion of women reporting at least 1 disorder increased incrementally with age, ranging from 9.7% (95% ci, 7.8%-11.7%) in women between ages 20 and 39 years to 49.7% (95% ci, 40.3%-59.1%) in those aged 80 years or older (p < .001), and parity (12.8% [95% ci, 9.0%-16.6%], 18.4% [95% ci, 12.9%-23.9%], 24.6% [95% ci, 19.5%-29.8%], and 32.4% [95% ci, 27.8%-37.1%] for 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more deliveries, respectively; p < .001). overweight and obese women were more likely to report at least 1 pelvic floor disorder than normal weight women (26.3% [95% ci, 21.7%-30.9%], 30.4% [95% ci, 25.8%-35.0%], and 15.1% [95% ci, 11.6%-18.7%], respectively; p < .001). we detected no differences in prevalence by racial/ethnic group.   conclusion pelvic floor disorders affect a substantial proportion of women and increase with age.
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (ido) is an intracellular heme-containing enzyme that is activated by proinflammatory cytokines, including interferon-γ (ifnγ), and metabolizes tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway. activation of murine macrophages induces not only ido but also nitric oxide synthase (inos), and the ensuing production of nitric oxide (no) inhibits ido. to determine the sensitivity of primary cultures of murine microglia to no, microglia were stimulated with recombinant murine ifnγ (1 ng/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (lps) (10 ng/ml). this combination of ifnγ+lps synergized to produce maximal amounts of nitrite as early as 16h. steady-state mrnas for both inos and ido were significantly increased by ifnγ+lps at 4h post-treatment, followed by an increase in ido enzymatic activity at 24h. murine microglia (>95% cd11b(+)) were pretreated with the inos inhibitor, l-nil hydrochloride, at a dose (30 μm) that completely abrogated production of nitrite. l-nil had no effect on ido mrna at 4h or ido enzymatic activity at 24h following stimulation with ifnγ+lps. these data establish that ido regulation in murine microglia is not restrained by no, thereby permitting the accumulation of kynurenine and its downstream metabolites in the central nervous system. induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (ido) and nitric oxide synthase (nos) is involved in the immunomodulatory roles of ifn-gamma and evidence suggests that these pathways are functionally cross-regulated. we report here that nitric oxide (no) negatively modulates the expression of ido activity in ifn-gamma-primed macrophages, but not in microglial cells from mouse. in mt2 macrophages, the induction of ido activity by ifn-gamma was further increased by the presence of nos inhibitors, whereas culturing of ifn-gamma-activated mt2 cells with no generators produced a marked reduction of ido activity expression. conversely, neither nos inhibitors nor exogenous no affected the induction of the enzyme activity in n11 microglial cells after ifn-gamma activation. lps and picolinic acid, two costimulatory agents that up-regulate inducible nos in activated cells, regulated ido induction differently in the two cell lines. lps and picolinic acid caused a significant decrease of ido activity in ifn-gamma-activated mt2 cells. this effect, however, did not appear to be mediated by the ability of lps and picolinic acid to stimulate no production. in n11 cells, lps further stimulated the enzyme activity and picolinic acid had no effect. northern blot analysis revealed that, in mt2 macrophages, nos inhibitors increased the levels of ido mrna, while a reduction was observed with picolinic acid. no changes in ido mrna levels were detected in n11 cells. consistent with the functional heterogeneity of phagocytes, the reported results indicate the existence of marked differences in the regulation of ido expression between murine macrophages and microglial cells.
abstract following a demonstration of golgi-impregnated neurons and their terminal axon arborization in the optic tectum, the neurons of the nucleus parvocellularis and magnocellularis isthmi were studied by means of postembedded electron-microscopical (em) γ-aminobutyric acid (gaba)-immunogold staining. in the parvocellular nucleus, none of the neuronal cell bodies or dendrites displayed gaba-like immunoreactivity in em preparations stained by postembedded gaba-immunogold. however, numerous gaba-like immunoreactive and also unlabeled terminals established synapses with gaba-negative neurons. gaba-like immunoreactive terminals were usually found at the dendritic origin. around the dendritic profiles, isolated synapses of both gaba-like immunoreactive and immunonegative terminals established glomerulus-like structures enclosed by glial processes. all giant and large neurons of the magnocellular nucleus of the isthmi displayed gaba-like immunoreactivity. their cell surface was completely covered by gaba-like immunoreactive and unlabeled terminals that established synapses with the neurons. these neurons are thought to send axon collaterals to the parvocellular nucleus; their axons enter the tectum opticum. the morphological characteristics of neurons of both isthmic nuclei are like those of interneurons, because of their numerous axosomatic synapses with both asymmetrical and symmetrical features. these neurons are not located among their target neurons and exert their modulatory effect on optic transmission in the optic tectum at a distance. the chick brain is a useful model system for studying the ontogeny and phylogeny of neural circuitry, especially that of the visual system. in this study the distribution of cells and processes showing gaba‐like immunoreactivity (gaba+) in the diencephalon and mesencephalon of the posthatch chick was determined immunohistochemically with a polyclonal antibody to gaba and compared with the results of similar studies in mammals. most of the small gaba+ cells were found in the chick visual centers such as the nucleus lateralis anterior, suprachiasmatic nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate, optic tract, dorsolateralis anterior pars lateralis, lentiformis mesencephali, ectomammillary nucleus, area pretectalis, and the optic tectum. large gaba+ cells were found in the following nuclei: reticularis superior, posteroventralis thalami, subpretectalis, isthmi pars magnocellularis, interstitiopretectosubpretectalis, mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis. these large cell‐containing nuclei receive projections from visual or auditory centers. gaba+ axons were found throughout the diencephalon and mesencephalon but were especially prominent in the ansa lenticularis, fasciculus medialis longitudinalis, and optic tract. the distribution of gaba+ cells in the chick is more widespread than in rodents and exhibits an increased association with the visual centers suggesting a correlation with the specialized visual requirements of the bird.
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) cascade is a highly conserved signaling module comprised of three sequentially activated protein kinases, which are rapidly phosphorylated near the membrane and dephosphorylated in the cytosol. it regulates various important biological processes including differentiation, proliferation, and synaptic plasticity. in this paper, a diffusion-reaction model is proposed to study this signal transduction pathway. it has been demonstrated before by quantitative analysis that the spatial separation of activation and deactivation of mapk kinases will lead to a spatially precipitous gradient of active mapks, which may be useful to enhance local concentrations of mapk-dedicated proteins, and hence promote signaling efficiency. on the other hand, this finding also poses a problem: how can signals concentrated near the membrane be effectively transmitted to the nucleus where necessary transcriptional programs have to be initiated? several additional mechanisms like endocytic trafficking and mapk dimerization may be responsible. the model is also extended to examine the possible contribution of phosphorylation-dependent mapk homodimerization to the nuclear transport of mapks. cells respond to a plethora of signals using a limited set of intracellular signal transduction components. surprisingly, pathways that transduce distinct signals can share protein components, yet avoid erroneous cross-talk. a highly tractable model system in which to study this paradox is the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, which harbors three mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signal transduction cascades that share multiple signaling components. in this review we first describe potential mechanisms by which specificity could be achieved by signaling pathways that share components. second, we summarize key features and components of the yeast mapk pathways that control the mating pheromone response, filamentous growth, and the response to high osmolarity. finally, we review biochemical analyses in yeast of mutations that cause cross-talk between these three mapk pathways and their implications for the mechanistic bases for signaling specificity. although much remains to be learned, current data indicate that scaffolding and cross pathway inhibition play key roles in the maintenance of fidelity.
background bipolar disorder is a heterogeneous mood disorder associated with several important clinical comorbidities, such as eating disorders. this clinical heterogeneity complicates the identification of genetic variants contributing to bipolar susceptibility. here we investigate comorbidity of eating disorders as a subphenotype of bipolar disorder to identify genetic variation that is common and unique to both disorders.   methods we performed a genome-wide association analysis contrasting 184 bipolar subjects with eating disorder comorbidity against both 1370 controls and 2006 subjects with bipolar disorder only from the bipolar genome study (bigs).   results the most significant genome-wide finding was observed bipolar with comorbid eating disorder vs. controls within sox2-ot (p=8.9×10(-8) for rs4854912) with a secondary peak in the adjacent fxr1 gene (p=1.2×10(-6) for rs1805576) on chromosome 3q26.33. this region was also the most prominent finding in the case-only analysis (p=3.5×10(-7) and 4.3×10(-6), respectively). several regions of interest containing genes involved in neurodevelopment and neuroprotection processes were also identified.   limitations while our primary finding did not quite reach genome-wide significance, likely due to the relatively limited sample size, these results can be viewed as a replication of a recent study of eating disorders in a large cohort.   conclusions these findings replicate the prior association of sox2-ot with eating disorders and broadly support the involvement of neurodevelopmental/neuroprotective mechanisms in the pathophysiology of both disorders. they further suggest that different clinical manifestations of bipolar disorder may reflect differential genetic contributions and argue for the utility of clinical subphenotypes in identifying additional molecular pathways leading to illness. correction to: molecular psychiatry 2002; 7: 851–859, doi:10.1038/sj.mp.4001114 owing to a publisher error, this article was mistakenly published twice. it first appeared in molecular psychiatry 2002; 7: 594–603, doi:10.1038/sj.mp.4001025. the publisher apologizes for any confusion this may have caused.
inferring the demographic history of species and their populations is crucial to understand their contemporary distribution, abundance and adaptations. the high computational overhead of likelihood‐based inference approaches severely restricts their applicability to large data sets or complex models. in response to these restrictions, approximate bayesian computation (abc) methods have been developed to infer the demographic past of populations and species. here, we present the results of an evaluation of the abc‐based approach implemented in the popular software package diyabc using simulated data sets (mitochondrial dna sequences, microsatellite genotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms). we simulated population genetic data under five different simple, single‐population models to assess the model recovery rates as well as the bias and error of the parameter estimates. the ability of diyabc to recover the correct model was relatively low (0.49): 0.6 for the simplest models and 0.3 for the more complex models. the recovery rate improved significantly when reducing the number of candidate models from five to three (from 0.57 to 0.71). among the parameters of interest, the effective population size was estimated at a higher accuracy compared to the timing of events. increased amounts of genetic data did not significantly improve the accuracy of the parameter estimates. some gains in accuracy and decreases in error were observed for scaled parameters (e.g., neμ) compared to unscaled parameters (e.g., ne and μ). we concluded that diyabc‐based assessments are not suited to capture a detailed demographic history, but might be efficient at capturing simple, major demographic changes. the analysis of genetic variation to estimate demographic and historical parameters and to quantitatively compare alternative scenarios recently gained a powerful and flexible approach: the approximate bayesian computation (abc). the likelihood functions does not need to be theoretically specified, but posterior distributions can be approximated by simulation even assuming very complex population models including both natural and human‐induced processes. prior information can be easily incorporated and the quality of the results can be analysed with rather limited additional effort. abc is not a statistical analysis per se, but rather a statistical framework and any specific application is a sort of hybrid between a simulation and a data‐analysis study. complete software packages performing the necessary steps under a set of models and for specific genetic markers are already available, but the flexibility of the method is better exploited combining different programs. many questions relevant in ecology can be addressed using abc, but adequate amount of time should be dedicated to decide among alternative options and to evaluate the results. in this paper we will describe and critically comment on the different steps of an abc analysis, analyse some of the published applications of abc and provide user guidelines.
the renal functions of 215 patients (24 with benign renal mass, the rest with rcc staged t1-t2) who underwent partial nephrectomy (pn) between 2003 and 2014 were evaluated to identify predictors of short- and long-term deterioration in renal function after pn among renal cell carcinoma (rcc) patients with or without preoperative predisposition to chronic kidney disease (ckd) and among patients with benign renal mass. the 1- and 5-year predictive factors for de novo ckd were statistically analyzed. the incidence of de novo ckd differed significantly (p < 0.001) among patients with benign renal mass, those with rcc but no preoperative ckd predisposition, and those with rcc combined with preoperative ckd predisposition. independent predictors for de novo ckd at 1 year postoperatively included intraoperative ischemic method, ecog score, elevated albumin levels, male sex, and smoking exposure (in pack-years). predictors for de novo ckd at 5 years postoperatively included hypertension, high preoperative albumin levels, de ritis ratio (aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio), smoking exposure, and preoperative predisposition to ckd. preoperative predisposition to ckd and ischemic method applied during pn, along with other preoperative parameters, were important factors affecting postoperative renal function deterioration in patients with t1-t2 rcc. the activity of the malate-aspartate shuttle for the reoxidation of cytoplasmic reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadh) by mitochondria was assessed in six lines of rodent ascites tumor cells (two strains of ehrlich ascites carcinoma, krebs ii carcinoma, novikoff hepatoma, as-30d hepatoma, and l1210 mouse leukemia). all the tumor cells examined showed mitochondrial reoxidation of cytoplasmic nadh, as evidenced by the accumulation of pyruvate when the cells were incubated aerobically with l-lactate. reoxidation of cytoplasmic nadh thus generated was completely inhibited by the transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetate. the involvement of the respiratory chain in the reoxidation of cytoplasmic nadh was demonstrated by the action of cyanide, rotenone, and antimycin a, which strongly inhibited the formation of pyruvate from added l-lactate. compounds that inhibit the carrier-mediated entry of malate into mitochondria, such as butylmalonate, benzenetricarboxylate, and iodobenzylmalonate, also inhibited the accumulation of pyruvate from added l-lactate by the tumor cells. the maximal rate of the malate-aspartate shuttle was established by addtion of arsenite to inhibit the mitochondrial oxidation of the pyruvate formed from added lactate. the capacity of the various tumor lines for the reoxidation of cytoplasmic nadh via the malate-aspartate shuttle approaches 20% of the total respiratory rate of the cells and thus appears to be sufficient to account for the mitochondrial reoxidation of that fraction of glycolytic nadh not reoxidized by pyruvate and lactate dehydrognenase in the cytoplasm.
purposerecently, new custom-fit pin guides in total knee arthroplasty (tka) have been introduced. use of these guides may reduce operating time. use of the guides combined with the absence of intramedullary alignment jigs may lead to reduced blood loss and improved early outcomes. our aim was to evaluate blood loss and early clinical outcomes in patients undergoing minimally invasive tka using custom-fit magnetic resonance imaging (mri)–based pin guides.methodsa prospective study in 80 patients was carried out. patients were divided randomly into 2 equal groups. in one group, intramedullary alignment jigs were used. in the second group, custom-fit mri-based pin guides were used. all patients received the same cemented posterior-stabilized implant through a mini-midvastus approach. the volume in the drain bottles was recorded after 48 h. hb loss was estimated by subtracting the postoperative from the preoperative hb level. transfusion requirements and surgical time were recorded. outcome measures were knee society scores (kss), knee flexion, knee swelling and pain.resultsthere was lower mean drainage of blood in the custom-fit group (391 ml vs. 603 ml; p < 0.0001). there was no difference in estimated loss of hb (3.6 g/dl vs. 4.1 g/dl; n.s.) and in transfusion requirements (7.5 % vs. 10 %; n.s.). surgical time was reduced in the custom-fit group (12 min less; p = 0.001). kss measured at week 2, 6 and 12 showed no significant difference between groups. knee flexion measured on days 7, 10 and at week 6, 12 and knee swelling and pain measured on days 1, 3, 10 and at week 6, 12 showed no significant difference between groups.conclusionsusing custom-fit pin guides reduces blood drainage, but not the estimated hb loss in minimally invasive tka and does not affect transfusion rate. surgical time is reduced. there is no effect on the early clinical outcomes.level of evidencetherapeutic study, level i. purposecorrect alignment of the leg and positioning of the components are important factors in good long-term outcome of total knee arthroplasty (tka). computer-assisted navigation systems were introduced to improve component alignment accuracies. the three main hypotheses of this study were that the navigated compared to jig-based patient will show the following: (1) no difference in clinical outcomes. (2) better alignment in the frontal and sagittal plane. (3) better rotational positioning of components.methodsthe authors evaluated 100 patients who had minimally invasive tka using either an image-free computer-assisted navigation system (n = 50) or a jig-based technique (n = 50). six months postoperatively, clinical and radiological evaluations were performed using full-length standing anteroposterior and lateral radiographs and ct scans of the knee.resultsknee society knee score, function score, and range of motion were comparable in the two groups after surgery. the percentage of patients with a frontal tibiofemoral angle within ±3° of the ideal was significantly higher in the navigated group than in the jig-based group (94% vs. 78%, respectively; p = 0.041). no significant differences were found between groups in terms of the frontal and sagittal planes as well as rotational alignment of the femoral or tibial components.conclusioncomputer-assisted tka gives a better correction of alignment of the leg compared with jig-based tka when combined with a minimally invasive surgical approach.
the current publication introduces an approach for obtaining parameters of a six phase double delta salient-pole synchronous machine, based on the standstill frequency response test. the described approach was verified by measurements on a automotive claw-pole alternator, done in a laboratory on a test bench. this paper presents the steps of the approach to identify the linear parameters of a salient-pole synchronous machine at standstill and by frequency response tests data (ssfr). it is currently established and demonstrated that stability parameters for synchronous machines can be obtained by performing frequency response tests with the machine at standstill. the objective of this study is to use several input-output signals, according to a setup test recommended by the standard ieee std 115, to identify the model structure and parameters of a salient-pole synchronous machine from frequency response tests data. this procedure consists of defining and conducting the frequency response tests, identifying the model structure, estimating the corresponding parameters, and making valid the resulting model. we estimate the parameters of operational impedances, or in other terms, the reactances and the time constants. the results are presented from tests on the synchronous machine of 1.5 kva/380v/1500 rpm. k e y w o r d s: synchronous machine, parameter estimation, modeling, standstill tests, frequency response
background sensitization of mechanosensitive afferents, which contribute to the exercise pressor reflex, has been recognized as a characteristic of patients with heart failure (hf); however, the hemodynamic implications of this hypersensitivity are unclear.   objectives the present study used passive leg movement (plm) and intrathecal injection of fentanyl to blunt the afferent portion of this reflex arc to better understand the role of the mechanoreflex on central and peripheral hemodynamics in hf.   methods femoral blood flow (fbf), mean arterial pressure, femoral vascular conductance, hr, stroke volume, cardiac output, ventilation, and muscle oxygenation of the vastus lateralis were assessed in 10 patients with new york heart association class ii hf at baseline and during 3 min of plm both with fentanyl and without (control).   results fentanyl had no effect on baseline measures but increased (control vs fentanyl, p < 0.05) the peak plm-induced change in fbf (493 ± 155 vs 804 ± 198 δml·min(-1)) and femoral vascular conductance (4.7 ± 2 vs 8.5 ± 3 δml·min(-1)·mm hg)(-1) while norepinephrine spillover (103% ± 19% vs 58% ± 17%δ) and retrograde fbf (371 ± 115 vs 260 ± 68 δml·min(-1)) tended to be reduced (p < 0.10). in addition, fentanyl administration resulted in greater plm-induced increases in muscle oxygenation, suggestive of increased microvascular perfusion. fentanyl had no effect on the ventilation, mean arterial pressure, hr, stroke volume, or cardiac output response to plm.   conclusions although movement-induced central hemodynamics were unchanged by afferent blockade, peripheral hemodynamic responses were significantly enhanced. thus, in patients with hf, a heightened mechanoreflex seems to augment peripheral sympathetic vasoconstriction in response to movement, a phenomenon that may contribute to exercise intolerance in this population. we investigated the role of somatosensory feedback on cardioventilatory responses to rhythmic exercise in five men. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, subjects performed the same leg cycling exercise (50/100/150/325 ± 19 w, 3 min each) under placebo conditions (interspinous saline, l(3)-l(4)) and with lumbar intrathecal fentanyl impairing central projection of spinal opioid receptor-sensitive muscle afferents. quadriceps strength was similar before and after fentanyl administration. to evaluate whether a cephalad migration of fentanyl affected cardioventilatory control centers in the brain stem, we compared resting ventilatory responses to hypercapnia (hcvr) and cardioventilatory responses to arm vs. leg cycling exercise after each injection. similar hcvr and minor effects of fentanyl on cardioventilatory responses to arm exercise excluded direct medullary effects of fentanyl. central command during leg exercise was estimated via quadriceps electromyogram. no differences between conditions were found in resting heart rate (hr), ventilation [minute ventilation (ve)], or mean arterial pressure (map). quadriceps electromyogram, o(2) consumption (vo(2)), and plasma lactate were similar in both conditions at the four steady-state workloads. compared with placebo, a substantial hypoventilation during fentanyl exercise was indicated by the 8-17% reduction in ve/co(2) production (vco(2)) secondary to a reduced breathing frequency, leading to average increases of 4-7 torr in end-tidal pco(2) (p < 0.001) and a reduced hemoglobin saturation (-3 ± 1%; p < 0.05) at the heaviest workload (∼90% maximal vo(2)) with fentanyl. hr was reduced 2-8%, map 8-13%, and ratings of perceived exertion by 13% during fentanyl vs. placebo exercise (p < 0.05). these findings demonstrate the essential contribution of muscle afferent feedback to the ventilatory, cardiovascular, and perceptual responses to rhythmic exercise in humans, even in the presence of unaltered contributions from other major inputs to cardioventilatory control.
the authors examined the risk of childhood brain cancer in relation to parental exposure to classes of pesticides among 154 children diagnosed with astrocytoma and 158 children diagnosed with primitive neuroectodermal tumors (pnet) in the united states and canada between 1986 and 1989. controls were selected by random digit dialing and were individually matched to cases by race, age, and geographic area. each job in the fathers' work history and the usual occupation of mothers were assigned a probability, intensity, and frequency of exposure to insecticides, herbicides, and agricultural and nonagricultural fungicides. elevated risks of astrocytoma were found for paternal exposure (ever vs. never) to all four classes of pesticides (odds ratio (or) = 1.4-1.6). an increased risk of pnet was observed for only herbicides (or = 1.5). for mothers, odds ratios for astrocytoma were elevated for insecticides, herbicides, and nonagricultural fungicides (or = 1.3-1.6) but not agricultural fungicides (or = 1.0). no indication was found of an increased risk for pnet. there was little indication for an association with cumulative and average parental exposure. most risk estimates were around unity, and exposure-response patterns were absent. overall, it seems unlikely that parental exposure to pesticides plays an important role in the etiology of childhood brain cancer. pesticides are used worldwide in agriculture, industry, public health and for domestic applications: as a consequence, a great part of the population may be exposed to these compounds. in spite of this extensive use, knowledge on the health risks associated with prolonged exposure is rather poor, and major uncertainties still exist. epidemiological observations in man have so far produced little conclusive information, mainly because of weaknesses in exposure assessment. therefore, information on the type and levels of exposure is fundamental in order to better understand and characterize risk to human health. exposure assessment can be carried out via measurement of environmental concentrations, as well as via determination of the chemical or its metabolites in body tissues (biological monitoring). besides indices of internal dose, biological monitoring also includes measurements of early effects attributable to interaction between the chemical agent and the human body. biological monitoring has the advantage, over environmental monitoring, of determining the dose actually absorbed via any possible route: differences in absorption can be taken into account. whether they are due to biological variability or to use of protective equipment. when, in some cases, a combination of occupational and non-occupational exposure occurs, this also can be taken into consideration by biological monitoring. few reference documents have been published on biological monitoring of pesticides. for this reason, the office of occupational health of the world health organization gave icps a mandate to prepare a monograph specifically addressed to reviewing methods for biological monitoring of pesticide exposure. this review is based on more than 300 studies published over the period 1980-1999. for the most representative chemical classes, the available biological exposure indices are reported. both indices of internal dose and. when available, of early effects are discussed. the reported tests were used to monitor exposure of pesticide applicators in agriculture and public health, manufacturing and formulating workers. subjects poisoned after accidental exposure or attempted suicide, volunteers involved in pharmacokinetic studies, as well as sub-groups of the general population exposed to environmentally persistent pesticides. single chapters deal with organophosphorus insecticides, carbamate pesticides, dithiocarbamates, phenoxyacids, quaternary ammonium compounds. coumarin rodenticides, synthetic pyrethroids, organochlorine pesticides, chlorotriazines, and pentachlorophenol.
the purpose of this prospective, questionnaire-based study is to assess pre-travel vaccinations and malaria prophylaxis for long-term travellers who receive pre-travel advice in greece. a total of 4721 travellers were studied from january 1, 2009 through december 31, 2012. travellers sought pre-travel advice at a mean of 19.7 days (range: 0-349 days) before departure. long-term travellers (≥ 1 month) accounted for 2205 (46.7%) of all travellers. long-term travellers had a mean age of 34.5 years. the majority of them were men (79.8%). in terms of destinations, 84% were visiting malaria-endemic countries and sub-saharan africa was the most common destination (17.7%). most long-term travellers pursued trips for work purposes (70%), visited urban areas (79.6%) and stayed in hotels (29.2%). yellow fever, typhoid fever, hepatitis a and tetanus/diphtheria vaccines were administered to 1647 (74.7%), 741 (33.6%), 652 (29.5%), and 589 (26.7%) travellers, respectively. yellow fever vaccine was administered to 339 (87%) and 132 (71%) of long-term travellers to sub-saharan africa and south america respectively, whereas typhoid vaccine to 119 (90.8%) and 330 (84.6%) of those travelling to the indian subcontinent and sub-saharan africa respectively. rabies vaccine was administered to 14 (0.6%) of them. malaria prophylaxis was recommended to 446 (20%) of long-term travellers. mefloquine was the most commonly (49%) prescribed agent, and was prescribed to 26.7% of long-term travellers to sub-sahara africa. in conclusion, this study revealed that recommendations for vaccine and malaria prophylaxis for long-term travellers to developing countries should be more selective, based on the assessment of all travellers' and travel characteristics, in order to provide adequate pre-travel preparation for this high risk group of travellers. more focused studies are suggested in order to understand the particular needs of long-term travellers. increasing awareness of travellers and travel health consultants is very important. an increasing number of travelers travel to hepatitis b-endemic countries. in travel medicine, vaccinations should be advised according to risks. the actual incidence of hepatitis b infection in short-term tourists is very low and probably not higher than it is for people who do not travel. there is evidence that long-term travelers and immigrants originating from hepatitis b-endemic countries are at higher risk of infection and they should always be offered vaccination. for all other travelers living in countries with universal hepatitis b vaccination, vaccination could be advised as a catch-up strategy.
depressive disorders are common, chronic, and costly. prevalence rates from community-based surveys range from 1.8% to 3.3% for depression within the past month and 4.9% to 17.1% for lifetime prevalence (1, 2). in primary care settings, the point prevalence of major depression ranges from 4.8% to 8.6% (3). depressive illness is projected to be the second leading cause of disability worldwide in 2020 (4). the substantial public health and economic significance of depression is reflected by its considerable effect on health care utilization and great monetary costs: $43 billion annually, of which $17 billion represents lost work days (5, 6). despite the high prevalence and substantial impact of depression, detection and treatment in the primary care setting have been suboptimal. studies have shown that usual care by primary care physicians fails to recognize 30% to 50% of depressed patients (7). because patients in whom depression goes unrecognized cannot be appropriately treated, systematic screening has been advocated as a means of improving detection, treatment, and outcomes of depression. in 1996, the u.s. preventive services task force found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for depression with standardized questionnaires (8). the task force recommended that clinicians maintain an especially high index of suspicion for depressive symptoms in adolescents and young adults, persons with a family or personal history of depression, those with chronic illnesses, those who perceive or have experienced a recent loss, and those with sleep disorders, chronic pain, or multiple unexplained somatic complaints (8). it also recommended physician education in recognizing and treating depression. to help determine whether systematic, routine screening for depression in adults is warranted, we performed an updated systematic review for the u.s. preventive services task force. specifically, we examined three key questions: 1) what is the accuracy of case-finding instruments for depression in primary care populations? 2) is treatment of depression in primary care patients effective in improving outcomes? 3) is routine systematic identification with case-finding questions (screening), with or without integrated management and follow-up systems, more effective than usual care in identifying patients with depression, facilitating treatment of patients with depression, and improving clinical outcomes? the results of the comprehensive review are available from the agency for healthcare research and quality (www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstfix.htm) (9). in brief, we found that several short, accurate, and easy-to-use instruments for detecting depression are available (9, 10) (table 1). brief instruments, including asking the patient two questions about the presence of depressed mood and anhedonia (over the past 2 weeks, have you felt down, depressed or hopeless? and over the past 2 weeks, have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things?), appear to perform as well as longer instruments. effective treatments, including pharmacologic and behavioral or counseling interventions, are available for depressed patients identified in primary care settings (9). table 1. characteristics of case-finding instruments used to detect depression in adults in primary care settings we also examined the evidence on whether screening for depression in primary care settings affects recognition, treatment, and clinical outcomes of adult patients with depression. in this article, we review the evidence pertaining to this overarching question. methods to identify relevant articles, we searched the medline database from january 1994 through august 2001 by using the medical subject headings depression or depressive disorders, plus keyword searches for commonly used screening instruments. these terms were then combined with the medical subject headings mass screening or sensitivity and specificity or primary health care or ambulatory care or family practice. we supplemented these sources by searching the cochrane database on depression, neurosis, and anxiety disorders; performing additional specific medline searches from 1966 to 1994; hand searching bibliographies; and querying experts. we reviewed randomized trials conducted in primary care settings that examined the effect of screening for depression on identification, treatment, or health outcomes, including trials that tested integrated, systematic support for treatment after identification of depression. two of the authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of the articles identified by the literature searches and excluded ones on which they agreed that eligibility criteria were not met. when the initial reviewers disagreed, the articles were carried forward to the next review stage in which the investigators reviewed the full articles and made a final decision about inclusion or exclusion by consensus. one reviewer abstracted the relevant information from each article into evidence tables. a second author checked these tables and noted discrepancies, which were then resolved by consensus. we calculated absolute differences in outcomes and 95% cis by using stata software, version 6.0 (stata corp., college station, texas), when these results were not presented in the original articles. to summarize the effect of screening on clinical outcomes, we performed meta-analysis by using revman software (cochrane collaboration, 2000) and the dersimonian and laird random-effects model. this evidence report was funded through a contract to the research triangle instituteuniversity of north carolina evidence-based practice center from the agency for healthcare research and quality. staff of the funding agency contributed to the study design, reviewed draft and final manuscripts, and made editing suggestions. results the effect of routine screening of adult patients for depression in primary care was compared with usual care in 14 randomized trials in primary care settings (11-25). the main outcomes examined were differences in providers' rate of detection or recognition of depression, the proportion of patients with depression who were treated or referred for treatment, and clinical outcomes of depression. the screening interventions differed in intensity. some trials provided feedback of screening results alone; others provided feedback and general or specific treatment advice to the providers; and some provided feedback and treatment advice and helped practices develop systematic means of improving the quality of treatment and follow-up. the trials, which were stratified by intensity of the intervention, are described below and summarized in tables 2, 3, 4, and 5. table 2. studies on the effect of screening and feedback table 3. summary of the effect of feedback from screening on rates of diagnosis table 4. summary of the effect of feedback from screening on rates of treatment table 5. summary of the effect of feedback from screening on patient outcomes effects of screening and feedback alone johnstone and goldberg applied the self-administered general health questionnaire to 1093 primary care patients and identified 119 with depression (14). these 119 patients were randomly assigned to immediate feedback of the results to the physician or to usual care. the groups did not differ significantly in mean general health questionnaire scores at 12-month follow-up, except for the subgroup of patients with severe depression, for whom feedback improved scores. among all patients, the total amount of time spent depressed within 1 year decreased by approximately 2 months (p < 0.01). three trials evaluated feedback of zung self-depression scale scores to providers. moore and colleagues asked 212 consecutive patients 20 to 60 years of age who attended a university-based family medicine residency clinic to self-administer the zung self-depression scale (15). the 96 patients who scored higher than 50 were randomly assigned to a group whose providers were given immediate written feedback of results or to a group whose providers received a generic note saying that their patients had been screened. the same note was affixed to the charts of patients in each group who had scored 50 or less. recognition of depression, as assessed by chart audit, was 56% in the intervention group (28 of 50 patients) and 22% in the control group (10 of 46 patients). prescription of treatment was not assessed. linn and yager tested immediate written feedback of zung self-depression scale results compared with no screening in 74 consecutive new patients from a primary care clinic, using chart audit to assess outcomes (16). depression was more likely to be diagnosed in patients assigned to the feedback group than in those receiving usual care (29% vs. 8%); treatment rates were low and similar in each group (13% vs. 8%). neither moore and colleagues nor linn and yager reported clinical outcomes. magruder-habib and associates screened 800 veterans administration patients for depression in a primary care clinic (18). research assistants administered the zung self-depression scale and used the diagnostic interview schedule to confirm diagnosis according to criteria from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, third edition (dsm-iii) (18, 26). the 100 patients who screened positive (excluding those with scores higher than 75 or history of depression) and met dsm-iii criteria for major depression were randomly assigned to feedback of screening results or usual care; chart audit was used to assess outcomes. patients whose physicians received feedback were three times more likely to be accurately identified as depressed at the index visit than were patients whose clinicians had not received such feedback (25% vs. 8%; difference, 17 percentage points [ci, 3 to 32 percentage points]). at 1 year of follow-up, 42% of the intervention group and 21% of the control group had been recognized as depresse background high utilizers of nonpsychiatric health care services have disproportionally high rates of undiagnosed or undertreated depression.   objective to determine the impact of offering a systematic primary care-based depression treatment program to depressed "high utilizers" not in active treatment.   design randomized clinical trial.   setting one hundred sixty-three primary care practices in 3 health maintenance organizations located in different geographic regions of the united states.   patients a group of 1465 health maintenance organization members were identified as depressed high utilizers using a 2-stage telephone screening process. eligibility criteria were met by 410 patients and 407 agreed to enroll: 218 in the depression management program (dmp) practices and 189 in the usual care (uc) group.   intervention the dmp included patient education materials, physician education programs, telephone-based treatment coordination, and antidepressant pharmacotherapy initiated and managed by patients' primary care physicians.   main outcome measures depression severity was measured using the hamilton depression rating scale (ham-d) and functional status using the medical outcomes study 20-item short form (sf-20) subscales. outpatient visit and hospitalization rates were measured using the health plan's encounter data.   results based on an intent-to-treat analysis, at least 3 antidepressant prescriptions were filled in the first 6 months by 151 (69.3%) of 218 of dmp patients vs 35 (18.5%) of 189 in uc (p < .001). improvements in ham-d scores were significantly greater in the intervention group at 6 weeks (p = .04), 3 months (p = .02), 6 months (p < .001), and 12 months (p < .001). at 12 months, dmp intervention patients were more improved than uc patients on the mental health, social functioning, and general health perceptions scales of the sf-20 (p < .05 for all).   conclusion in depressed high utilizers not already in active treatment, a systematic primary care-based treatment program can substantially increase adequate antidepressant treatment, decrease depression severity, and improve general health status compared with usual care.
agmatine treatment is known to exert neuroprotective effects in several models of neurotoxic and ischemic brain and spinal cord injuries. here we sought to find out whether agmatine treatment would also prove to be neuroprotective in the mouse 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp) model of parkinson’s disease. concomitant daily treatment (intraperitoneal injections) with agmatine (100 mg/kg for 5 days) and mptp (40 mg/kg for 2 days) exacerbated mptp-related toxicity as evidenced by a larger reduction in dopamine uptake into striatal synaptosomes (42.4% as compared to 58.3% of control, respectively). in contrast, agmatine treatment commencing after mptp, produced partial protection (31%) against mptp dopaminergic toxicity. the findings implicate agmatine in mechanisms regulating mptp neurotoxicity, but underscore the characteristic neuroprotective efficacy of agmatine when applied after the insult. the biochemical and cellular changes that occur following administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp) are remarkably similar to that seen in idiopathic parkinson's disease (pd). in this review, we detail the molecular activities of this compound from peripheral intoxication through its various biotransformations. in addition, we detail the interplay that occurs between the different cellular compartments (neurons and glia) that eventually consort to kill substantia nigra pars compacta (snpc) neurons.
in a ubiquitous scenario, people are typically confronted with context evolution and changing influences. this may create new needs and may condition the user perception of what is relevant information. over the years, different approaches have been proposed to design personalized recommender systems (rs), but state-of-the-art approaches mostly assume a fixed representation of a user profile; the dynamicity of the user's interests (and the way of expressing them) while interacting with the environment is not considered. aim of this work is to predict a user's preferences in the tourism domain, to provide personalized and context-aware recommendations. therefore, we define a user profile model which expresses in a formal way the user's opinions with respect to a particular entity. in particular, the proposed approach formally models the user generated content (ugc) connected to a group of reviews (written by expert users) for each entity, and compares it with a (positive and negative) statistical language model representing the target user profile associated with that entity. the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated on a real-case scenario. we describe our efforts in trec 2012 contextual suggestion track. the task is to provide sug- gestions to users based on their personal interests as well as their contexts. to tackle the problem, we propose to rank candidate suggestions based on their similarity to the personal profile and that to the contexts (i.e., geographic and temporal information). the ranking function is computed based on the similarity between a suggestion and the places that the user like and the dis-similarity between the suggestion and the places disliked by the user. the similarities are computed based on the either the category or description of the suggestions.
research on marine natural products as potential anticancer agents is still limited. in the present study, an aqueous extract of a canadian marine microalgal preparation was assessed for anticancer activities using various assays and cell lines of human cancers, including lung, prostate, stomach, breast, and pancreatic cancers, as well as an osteosarcoma. in vitro, the microalgal extract exhibited marked anticolony forming activity. in addition, it was more toxic, as indicated by increased apoptosis, to nonadherent cells (grown in suspension) than to adherent cells. in vivo, an antimetastatic effect of the extract was observed in nod-scid mice carrying subrenal capsule xenografts of pc3 prostate cancer cells. the results of the present study suggest that the antimetastatic effect of the aqueous microalgal extract is based on inhibition of colony forming ability of cancer cells and the preferential killing of suspended cancer cells. further research aimed at identification of the molecular basis of the anticancer activities of the microalgal extract appears to be warranted. angiogenesis is required for invasive tumor growth and metastasis and constitutes an important point in the control of cancer progression. its inhibition may be a valuable new approach to cancer therapy. avascular tumors are severely restricted in their growth potential because of the lack of a blood supply. for tumors to develop in size and metastatic potential they must make an "angiogenic switch" through perturbing the local balance of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. frequently, tumors overexpress proangiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, allowing them to make this angiogenic switch. two strategies used in the development of antiangiogenic agents involve the inhibition of proangiogenic factors (eg, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibodies) as well as therapy with endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis, such as endostatin and angiostatin. therapy with endogenous angiogenic inhibitors such as endostatin and angiostatin may reverse the angiogenic switch preventing growth of tumor vasculature. preclinical studies have shown that endostatin effectively inhibits tumor growth and shrinks existing tumor blood vessels. phase 1 clinical trials of endostatin and angiostatin are ongoing, and preliminary results show minimal toxicities.
several lines of experimental data have highlighted a key role of amadori‐glycated phosphatidylethanolamine (amadori‐pe) in the development of diabetic complications. recent epidemiological studies suggest that diabetes mellitus could be a risk factor for some cancers. a characteristic of cancer cells is their immortal phenotype, and the enzyme telomerase contributes to the infinite replicative potential of cancer cells. the purpose of this study was to obtain new information about the effect of amadori‐pe on the regulation of telomerase in panc‐1 human pancreatic carcinoma cells. amadori‐pe enhanced cellular telomerase in a time‐ and dose‐dependent manner by up‐regulating htert expression through induction of c‐myc. these results provide experimental evidence for a novel role of amadori‐pe in linking diabetes and cancer. glycation has been implicated in the endothelial dysfunction that contributes to both diabetes‐ and aging‐associated vascular complications. the aim of the present study was to determine whether amadori‐glycated phosphatidylethanolamine (amadori‐pe), a lipid‐linked glycation compound that is formed at an increased rate in hyperglycemic states, affected proliferation, migration and tube formation of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec). amadori‐pe at a low concentration of less than 5 μm significantly enhanced these three factors involved in angiogenesis. furthermore, stimulation of huvec with amadori‐pe resulted in secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (mmp‐2), a pivotal enzyme in the initial step of angiogenesis. our results demonstrated for the first time that amadori‐pe may be an important compound that promotes vascular disease as a result of its angiogenic activity on endothelial cells. we also demonstrated that mmp‐2 is a primary mediator of amadori‐pe‐driven angiogenesis.
breast cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer death in women. mortality is primarily due to the development of metastases. although therapies exist, they lack efficacy in preventing metastatic growth. as a result, novel agents are being investigated. in particular, treatments that target the immune system are being examined as potential anti-neoplastic agents. cordyceps sinensis (cs) is a fungus that has been used for over 2,000 years in china as a treatment for a variety of conditions including neoplasms. the available evidence suggests that efficacy of cs as an anti-neoplastic therapeutic agent is related to a role as an activator of innate immune responses. the objectives of this study were: to investigate the ability of cs to activate macrophages to produce factors that will induce protective responses against tumour growth; to study the ability of cs to reduce primary tumour growth in vivo; and to examine the ability of cs to reduce lung metastasis growth in vivo. we found that oral cs does not reduce primary tumour growth but can reduce lung metastasis occurrence in a surgical excision model of metastatic mammary carcinoma. the evidence we have shown to date suggests that the reduction in metastases growth may be due to the effects of macrophage-derived factors on tumour cell cycle. bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) stimulate mouse peritoneal macrophages to kill tumor cells in vitro. lysis is confined to tumor cells where it is nonspecific; both allogeneic and syngeneic cells being susceptible. stimulation by lps appears to be due to direct interaction between lps and macrophages and does not involve participation by lymphocytes. after exposure to lps, a latent period must elapse before macrophages can lyse tumor cells. the cytolytic mechanism requires contact between target cells and viable effector cells which maintain their lytic capacity for a sustained period and can kill on repeated occasions. the generation of a macrophage cytolytic effect by lps is critically dependent upon the absolute number of macrophages which must be sufficient to produce confluent monolayers. these findings indicate that lps stimulation of macrophages in vitro represents a valuable model system for the study of the mechanisms of macrophage stimulation and of the mediation of tumor cell death.
ticks are serious haematophagus arthropod pests and are only second to mosquitoes as vectors of diseases of humans and animals. the salivary glands of the slower feeding hard ticks such as haemaphysalis longicornis are a rich source of bioactive molecules and are critical to their biologic success, yet distinct molecules that help prolong parasitism on robust mammalian hosts and achieve blood-meals remain unidentified. here, we report on the molecular and biochemical features and precise functions of a novel kunitz inhibitor from h. longicornis salivary glands, termed haemangin, in the modulation of angiogenesis and in persistent blood-feeding. haemangin was shown to disrupt angiogenesis and wound healing via inhibition of vascular endothelial cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. further, this compound potently inactivated trypsin, chymotrypsin, and plasmin, indicating its antiproteolytic potential on angiogenic cascades. analysis of haemangin-specific gene expression kinetics at different blood-feeding stages of adult ticks revealed a dramatic up-regulation prior to complete feeding, which appears to be functionally linked to the acquisition of blood-meals. notably, disruption of haemangin-specific mrna by a reverse genetic tool significantly diminished engorgement of adult h. longicornis, while the knock-down ticks failed to impair angiogenesis in vivo. to our knowledge, we have provided the first insights into transcriptional responses of human microvascular endothelial cells to haemangin. dna microarray data revealed that haemangin altered the expression of 3,267 genes, including those of angiogenic significance, further substantiating the antiangiogenic function of haemangin. we establish the vital roles of haemangin in the hard tick blood-feeding process. moreover, our results provide novel insights into the blood-feeding strategies that enable hard ticks to persistently feed and ensure full blood-meals through the modulation of angiogenesis and wound healing processes. in recent years, the basement membrane (bm) — a specialized form of extracellular matrix (ecm) — has been recognized as an important regulator of cell behaviour, rather than just a structural feature of tissues. the bm mediates tissue compartmentalization and sends signals to epithelial cells about the external microenvironment. the bm is also an important structural and functional component of blood vessels, constituting an extracellular microenvironment sensor for endothelial cells and pericytes. vascular bm components have recently been found to be involved in the regulation of tumour angiogenesis, making them attractive candidate targets for potential cancer therapies.
the balance between proliferation and apoptosis of mesangial cells is a critical component of proliferative glomerulonephritis. the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis is linked at the level of the cell cycle (shankland sj. kidney int 52: 294-308, 199). cpla2-interacting protein (plip), the tip60 splice variant, interacts with cpla2 and enhances the susceptibility of renal mesangial cells to serum deprivation-induced apoptosis (sheridan am, force t, yoon hj, o'leary e, choukroun g, taheri mr, and bonventre jv. mol cell biol 21: 4470-4481, 2001). we report that adenoviral-driven plip expression results in enhanced apoptosis of non-serum-deprived mesangial cells associated with a marked decrease in g0/g1 phase cells. the effect of plip on the cell cycle may be independent of its interaction with cpla2 because a mutation of plip that does not interact with cpla2 also causes a decrease in g0/g1 cells. endogenous plip and tip60 protein levels are increased in cells exposed to injurious stimuli including x-irradiation and h2o2, but the intracellular localization of the splice variants may differ. whereas plip localizes in the nucleus of all mesangial cells, tip60 localizes in the cytosol of untreated mesangial cells and of cells exposed to low concentrations (50-200 microm) of h2o2. tip60 is targeted to the nucleus of cells exposed to high concentrations (1-2 mm) of h2o2. we conclude that plip may cause cells to exit from the cell cycle after the s phase and may function as part of a g2/m checkpoint mechanism. tip60 splice variants may function in both cytosolic and nuclear signaling pathways in mesangial cells. abstract the group iv cytosolic phospholipase a2(cpla2) has been localized to the nucleus (m. r. sierra-honigmann, j. r. bradley, and j. s. pober, lab. investig. 74:684–695, 1996) and is known to translocate from the cytosolic compartment to the nuclear membrane (s. glover, m. s. de carvalho, t. bayburt, m. jonas, e. chi, c. c. leslie, and m. h. gelb, j. biol. chem. 270:15359–15367, 1995; a. r. schievella, m. k. regier, w. l. smith, and l. l. lin, j. biol. chem. 270:30749–30754, 1995). we hypothesized that nuclear proteins interact with cpla2 and participate in the functional effects of this translocation. we have identified a nuclear protein, cpla2-interacting protein (plip), a splice variant of human tip60, which interacts with the amino terminal region of cpla2. like tip60, plip cdna includes the myst domain containing a c2hc zinc finger and well-conserved similarities to acetyltransferases. both plip and tip60 coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize with cpla2 within the nuclei of transfected cos cells. a polyclonal antibody raised to plip recognizes both plip and tip60. endogenous tip60 and/or plip in rat mesangial cells is localized to the nucleus in response to serum deprivation. nuclear localization coincides temporally with apoptosis. plip expression, mediated by adenoviral gene transfer, potentiates serum deprivation-induced prostaglandin e2 (pge2) production and apoptosis in mouse mesangial cells from cpla2 +/+ mice but not in mesangial cells derived from cpla2 −/− mice. thus plip, a splice variant of tip60, interacts with cpla2 and potentiates cpla2-mediated pge2 production and apoptosis.
in vertebrates, the taste system provides information used in the regulation of food ingestion. in mammals, each cell group within the taste buds expresses either the t1r or the t2r taste receptor for preference–aversion discrimination. however, no such information is available regarding fish. we developed a novel system for quantitatively assaying taste preference–aversion in medaka fish. in this study, we prepared fluorescently labeled foods with fine cavities designed to retain tastants until they were bitten by the fish. the subjects were fed food containing a mixture of amino acids and inosine monophosphate (an food), denatonium benzoate (dn food) or no tastant (nt food), and the amounts of ingested food were measured by fluorescence microscopy. statistical analysis of the fluorescence intensities yielded quantitative measurements of an food preference and dn food aversion. we then generated a transgenic fish expressing dominant‐negative gαi2 both in t1r‐expressing and in t2r‐expressing cells. the feeding assay revealed that the transgenic fish was unable to show a preference for an food and an aversion to dn food. the assay system was useful for evaluating taste‐blind behaviors, and the results indicate that the two taste signaling pathways conveying preferable and aversive taste information are conserved in fish as well as in mammals. in mammals, taste perception is a major mode of sensory input. we have identified a novel family of 40-80 human and rodent g protein-coupled receptors expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells of the tongue and palate epithelia. these candidate taste receptors (t2rs) are organized in the genome in clusters and are genetically linked to loci that influence bitter perception in mice and humans. notably, a single taste receptor cell expresses a large repertoire of t2rs, suggesting that each cell may be capable of recognizing multiple tastants. t2rs are exclusively expressed in taste receptor cells that contain the g protein alpha subunit gustducin, implying that they function as gustducin-linked receptors. in the accompanying paper, we demonstrate that t2rs couple to gustducin in vitro, and respond to bitter tastants in a functional expression assay.
background in 1993 the french national federation of cancer centres (fnclcc) initiated the standards, options and recommendations (sor) project. this is a collaboration between the fnclcc, the 20 french cancer centres, and specialists from french public universities, general hospitals and private clinics, and some specialists learned societies. the main objective is to develop clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of health care and the outcome of cancer patients.   materials and methods the sors are developed using a methodology based on a literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary group of experts, with feedback from specialists in cancer care delivery.   results in 1999, the initial sors for the management of women with cervical cancer were published. at that time the use of chemoradiotherapy was considered as an option. since this original publication, five randomised trials comparing chemoradiotherapy with radiotherapy have been published, as well as a systematic review and two other clinical practice guidelines. in the light of this additional evidence, it was decided to update the guidelines on chemoradiotherapy in women with cervical cancer.   conclusion after selection, critical analysis and integration of new evidence, chemoradiotherapy has become a standard for women with cervical cancer. purpose to report mature results of a randomized trial that compared extended-field radiotherapy (efrt) versus pelvic radiotherapy with concomitant fluorouracil and cisplatin (ctrt) in women with locoregionally advanced carcinomas of the uterine cervix.   patients and methods four hundred three women with cervical cancer were randomly assigned to receive either efrt or ctrt. patients were eligible if they had stage iib to iva disease, stage ib to iia disease with a tumor diameter > or = 5 cm, or positive pelvic lymph nodes. patients were stratified by stage and by method of lymph node evaluation.   results the median follow-up time for 228 surviving patients was 6.6 years. the overall survival rate for patients treated with ctrt was significantly greater than that for patients treated with efrt (67% v 41% at 8 years; p <.0001). there was an overall reduction in the risk of disease recurrence of 51% (95% ci, 36% to 66%) for patients who received ctrt. patients with stage ib to iib disease who received ctrt had better overall and disease-free survival than those treated with efrt (p <.0001); 116 patients with stage iii to iva disease had better disease-free survival (p =.05) and a trend toward better overall survival (p =.07) if they were randomly assigned to ctrt. the rate of serious late complications of treatment was similar for the two treatment arms.   conclusion mature analysis confirms that the addition of fluorouracil and cisplatin to radiotherapy significantly improved the survival rate of women with locally advanced cervical cancer without increasing the rate of late treatment-related side effects.
this paper addresses the origin of the decrease in the external electrical bias required for water photoelectrolysis with hematite photoanodes, observed following surface treatments of such electrodes. we consider two alternative surface modifications: a cobalt oxo/hydroxo-based (coox) overlayer, reported previously to function as an efficient water oxidation electrocatalyst, and a ga2o3 overlayer, reported to passivate hematite surface states. transient absorption studies of these composite electrodes under applied bias showed that the cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset observed after each of the surface modifications is accompanied by a similar cathodic shift of the appearance of long-lived hematite photoholes, due to a retardation of electron/hole recombination. the origin of the slower electron/hole recombination is assigned primarily to enhanced electron depletion in the fe2o3 for a given applied bias. transient absorption spectroscopy on the μs-s time scale is used to monitor the yield and decay dynamics of photogenerated holes in nanocrystalline hematite photoanodes. in the absence of a positive applied bias, these holes are observed to undergo rapid electron-hole recombination. the application of a positive bias results in the generation of long-lived (3 ± 1 s lifetime) photoholes.
ghrelin is 28-amino-acid peptide that was discovered from the rat and human stomach in 1999. since the discovery of ghrelin, various functions of ghrelin, including growth hormone release, feeding behavior, glucose metabolism, memory, and also antidepressant effects, have been studied. it has also been reported that ghrelin in the gastrointestinal tract has an important physiological effect on gastric acid secretion and gastrointestinal motility. ghrelin has a unique structure that is modified by o-acylation with n-octanoic acid at third serine residues, and this modification enzyme has recently been identified and named ghrelin o-acyl transferase (goat). ghrelin is considered to be a gut-brain peptide and is abundantly produced from endocrine cells in the gastrointestinal mucosa. in the gastrointestinal tract, ghrelin cells are most abundant in the stomach and are localized in gastric mucosal layers. ghrelin cells are also widely distributed throughout the gastrointestinal tract. in addition, abundance of ghrelin cells in the gastric mucosa is evolutionally conserved from mammals to lower vertebrates, indicating that gastric ghrelin plays important roles for fundamental physiological functions. ghrelin cells in the gastrointestinal tract are a major source of circulating plasma ghrelin, and thus understanding the physiology of these cells would reveal the biological significance of ghrelin. ghrelin, an acylated peptide produced predominantly in the stomach, stimulates feeding and gh secretion via interactions with the gh secretagogue type 1a receptor (ghs-r1a), the functionally active form of the ghs-r. ghrelin molecules exist in the stomach and hypothalamus as two major endogenous forms, a form acylated at serine 3 (ghrelin) and a des-acylated form (des-acyl ghrelin). acylation is indispensable for the binding of ghrelin to the ghs-r1a. ghrelin enhances feeding via the neuronal pathways of neuropeptide y and orexin, which act as orexigenic peptides in the hypothalamus. we here studied the effect of des-acyl ghrelin on feeding behavior. intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of rat des-acyl ghrelin to rats or mice fed ad libitum stimulated feeding during the light phase; neither ip nor icv administration of des-acyl ghrelin to fasting mice suppressed feeding. the icv administration of des-acyl ghrelin induced the expression of fos, a marker of neuronal activation, in orexin-expressing neurons of the lateral hypothalamic area, but not neuropeptide y-expressing neurons of the arcuate nucleus. peripheral administration of des-acyl ghrelin to rats or mice did not affect feeding. although icv administration of ghrelin did not induce food intake in ghs-r-deficient mice, it did in orexin-deficient mice. in contrast, icv administration of des-acyl ghrelin stimulated feeding in ghs-r-deficient mice, but not orexin-deficient mice. des-acyl ghrelin increased the intracellular calcium concentrations in isolated orexin neurons. central des-acyl ghrelin may activate orexin-expressing neurons, perhaps functioning in feeding regulation through interactions with a target protein distinct from the ghs-r.
this research investigated the hypothesis that sequential patterns of behavior can be learned by 2 independent mechanisms. one requires attention to the relation between successive events, whereas the other operates independently of such attention. in 4 experiments, subjects learned visuospatial sequences in a serial reaction time task. the relation between attentional and nonattentional learning was explored by assessing the extent to which learning transferred between conditions with or without distraction. the results suggest that attentional and nonattentional learning operate independently, in parallel, do not share information, and represent sequential information in qualitatively different ways. a fundamental type of learning in which humans excel is the learning of sequential patterns of behavior. in four experiments, we investigated the hypothesis that humans exhibit two forms of sequential learning. one form of learning requires attention to the relation between successive events in the sequence, not only for acquisition but also for the expression of the learning in performance. we hypothesized that the other type of sequential learning did not require attention to these relations. furthermore, these two forms of learning are independent of one another, with no communication or sharing of information between them. if subjects perform a series of behavioral acts that occur in a predictable order and under conditions relatively free of distraction, we suppose that attentionally based and nonattentionally based learning of the sequence occur in parallel. if distraction is added during learning, the attentional form is disabled, but the nonattentional one is unmodified. that is, attention is neither necessary nor helpful to the nonattentional form of learning. this hypothesis is similar to ideas examined by other investigators but is also different in several ways. nissen and her colleagues (nissen & bullemer, 1987; willingham, nissen, & bullemer, 1989; see also lewicki, hill, & bizot, 1988; stadler, 1989) have suggested that learning of sequences can be either procedural (without awareness) or declarative (with awareness). both of these, according to nissen, require attention. we distinguish both of those forms from a third, nonattentional type of learning. how is complex sequential material acquired, processed, and represented when there is no intention to learn? two experiments exploring a choice reaction time task are reported. unknown to ss, successive stimuli followed a sequence derived from a "noisy" finite-state grammar. after considerable practice (60,000 exposures) with experiment 1, ss acquired a complex body of procedural knowledge about the sequential structure of the material. experiment 2 was an attempt to identify limits on ss ability to encode the temporal context by using more distant contingencies that spanned irrelevant material. taken together, the results indicate that ss become increasingly sensitive to the temporal context set by previous elements of the sequence, up to 3 elements. responses are also affected by priming effects from recent trials. a connectionist model that incorporates sensitivity to the sequential structure and to priming effects is shown to capture key aspects of both acquisition and processing and to account for the interaction between attention and sequence structure reported by cohen, ivry, and keele (1990).
purpose glycine and serine are well-known, classic metabolites of glycolysis. here, we profiled the expression of enzymes associated with serine/glycine metabolism in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer and discuss their potential clinical implications. methods we used western blotting and immunohistochemistry to examine five serine-/glycine-metabolism–associated proteins (phgdh, psat, psph, shmt, and gldc) in six breast cancer cell lines and 709 breast cancer cases using tissue microarray (tma). results phgdh and psph, associated with serine metabolism, were highly expressed in the tnbc cells. gldc, associated with glycine metabolism, was highly expressed in her-2-positive mda-mb-453 and tnbc-related mda-mb-435s. tma showed that the tnbc-type breast cancer tissues highly expressed phgdh, psph, and shmt1, but not the luminal-a-type tissues (p<0.001). psph and shmt1 expression in the tumor stroma of her-2-type cancers was the highest, but the luminal-a tissues showed the lowest expression (p<0.001). gldc was most frequently expressed in cancer cells and stroma of the her-2-positive cancers and least frequently in tnbc (p<0.001). by cox multivariate analysis, tumor psph positivity (hazard ratio [hr]: 2.068, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.049–4.079, p = 0.036), stromal psph positivity (hr: 2.152, 95% ci: 1.107–4.184, p = 0.024), and stromal shmt1 negativity (hr: 2.142, 95% ci: 1.219–3.764, p = 0.008) were associated with short overall survival. conclusions expression of serine-metabolism–associated proteins was increased in tnbc and decreased in the luminal-a cancers. expression of glycine-metabolism–associated proteins was high in the tumor and stroma of her-2-positive cancers. identification of the factors critical to the tumor-initiating cell (tic) state may open new avenues in cancer therapy. here we show that the metabolic enzyme glycine decarboxylase (gldc) is critical for tics in non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). tics from primary nsclc tumors express high levels of the oncogenic stem cell factor lin28b and gldc, which are both required for tic growth and tumorigenesis. overexpression of gldc and other glycine/serine enzymes, but not catalytically inactive gldc, promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. we found that gldc induces dramatic changes in glycolysis and glycine/serine metabolism, leading to changes in pyrimidine metabolism to regulate cancer cell proliferation. in the clinic, aberrant activation of gldc correlates with poorer survival in lung cancer patients, and aberrant gldc expression is observed in multiple cancer types. this link between glycine metabolism and tumorigenesis may provide novel targets for advancing anticancer therapy.
aims: medicinal plants have always been highly valued as an accessible traditional treatment for atopic dermatitis in vietnam. accordingly, this review aims to assemble and discuss plants with validated anti-atopic dermatitis potency in the country, putting a great emphasis on the practice of phytomedicines and the development of plant-based products for dermatologic conditions. existing concerns and future perspectives are included to ensure comprehensiveness of the overview. methodology: this review is a systematic compilation of published in vitro studies, clinical trials and case studies on the effectiveness of single plant extracts in alleviating atopic dermatitis that can be found in vietnam. results: 39 publications presenting 31 plant species were collected in total. preparation of plant extracts and route of administration varied slightly between the studies. root and leaves are plant parts that were most commonly investigated (25.00% and 22.50%). disease symptoms were mostly induced on nc/nga mice (61.54%) using sensitizers like 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (28.57%), 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (25.71%) and dermatophagoides farinae body extract (28.57%). effects of plant extracts on epidermal/dermal thickness, ige serum level, infiltration of review article trang and son; jocamr, 1(4): xxx-xxx, 2016; article no.jocamr.30578 2 immune cells and hyperproduction of inflammatory cytokines were intensively investigated in the collected studies. conclusion: this review highlights the enormous potential of medicinal plants as an effective and easily accessible alternative therapy against atopic dermatitis. the use of these still needs to be further supported by scientific evidence and controlled by strict regulations to ensure good practice and stable development of phytomedicines. licorice (glycyrrhiza glabra l., leguminosae) is frequently used in traditional medicine to treat inflammatory and allergic diseases. in this study, the main components (glycyrrhizin, 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, isoliquiritin, and liquiritigenin) were isolated from licorice, and their anti-allergic effects, such as antiscratching behavior and ige production-inhibitory activity, were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. liquiritigenin and 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid most potently inhibited the degranulation of rbl-2h3 cells induced by ige with the antigen (dnp-hsa) and rat peritoneal mast cells induced by compound 48/80. liquiritigenin and 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid potently inhibited the passive cutaneous anaphylactic reaction as well as the scratching behavior in mice induced by compound 48/80. these components inhibited the production of ige in ovalbumin-induced asthma mice but liquiritigenin had little effect. this suggests that the antiallergic effects of licorice are mainly due to glycyrrhizin, 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, and liquiritigenin, which can relieve ige-induced allergic diseases such as dermatitis and asthma.
background: children of parents with bipolar disorder appear to have an increased risk of early-onset bipolar disorder (bp), mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. objectives: the aim of this study was to compare the mental health of school-age children of parents, with/without bipolar disorder. materials and methods: this case-control study included one hundred children aged six to twelve years, who had parents with bipolar disorder and 200 children of 163 demographically-matched control parents. parents with bipolar disorder were recruited from farshchian psychiatric hospital of hamadan, iran, during year 2014. the parent version of the child symptom inventory-4 questionnaire was used to measure mental health. mean comparisons were performed using student’s t test while effect sizes were estimated by cohen’s d coefficient. the chi-square test was used to assess significant differences between frequency distribution of demographic variables in both groups. the significance level was considered less than 0.05. results: there were statistically significant differences between children of parents with and those without bipolar disorder regarding attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct, generalized anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, major depression, separation anxiety (p< 0.001) and social phobia (p < 0.05). children of parents with bp are at high risk for psychiatric disorders. conclusions: these findings support that the careful evaluation and prospective following of the psychopathology of children of parents with bipolar disorder are critical for early identification and treatment. background to examine the risk for psychopathology in offspring at risk for bipolar disorder and the course of psychiatric disorders in these youth.   methods using structured diagnostic interviews (structured clinical interview for dsm-iv [scid] and kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia [k-sads]), psychiatric diagnoses of 117 nonreferred offspring of parents with diagnosed bipolar disorder were compared with those of 171 age- and gender-matched offspring of parents without bipolar disorder or major depression.   results compared with offspring of parents without mood disorders, high-risk youth had elevated rates of major depression and bipolar disorder, anxiety, and disruptive behavior disorders. high-risk offspring also had significantly more impaired global assessment of functioning (gaf) scores, higher rates of psychiatric treatment, and higher rates of placement in special education classes. disruptive behavior disorders, separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (gad), social phobia, and depression tended to have their onset in early or middle childhood, whereas bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd), panic disorder, and substance use disorder had onset most frequently in adolescence.   conclusions these findings support the hypothesis that offspring of parents with bipolar disorder are at significantly increased risk for developing a wide range of severe psychiatric disorders and accompanying dysfunction. early disruptive behavior and anxiety disorders, as well as early-onset depression, may be useful markers of risk for subsequent bipolar disorder in high-risk samples.
this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders and rheumatic diseases among the indigenous qom (toba) population in the city of rosario, santa fe, argentina. an analytical cross-sectional study using methodology of the community oriented program for the control of rheumatic diseases (copcord) was performed. subjects ≥18 years of age were interviewed by advanced students of medicine and nursing, bilingual translator-facilitators, and coordinators. individuals with musculoskeletal pain (positive cases) were evaluated sequentially for 7 days by internists and rheumatologists for diagnosis and treatment. the study included 1656 individuals (77 % of the census population). of these, 1020 (61.5 %) were female, with mean age of 35.3 (sd 13.9) years, and 1028 (62.0 %) were bilingual. the public health care system covers 87.1 % of the population. musculoskeletal pain in the previous 7 days and/or at some time during their life was present in 890 subjects (53.7 %). of those with pain in the last 7 days, 302 (64.1 %) subjects had an health assessment questionnaire disability index (haq-di) score ≥0.8. the most frequent pain sites were lumbar spine (19.3 %), knees (13.0 %), and hands (12.0 %). the prevalence of rheumatic diseases was as follows: mechanical back pain (20.1 %), rheumatic regional pain syndrome (2.9 %), osteoarthritis (4.0 %) rheumatoid arthritis (2.4 %), inflammatory back pain (0.2 %), systemic sclerosis (0.1 %), sjögren syndrome (0.1 %), fibromyalgia (0.1 %), mixed connective tissue disease (0.06 %), and systemic lupus erythematosus (0.06 %). the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders was 53.7 % and rheumatic diseases 29.6 %. rheumatoid arthritis prevalence was 2.4 % using copcord methodology, one of the highest reported at present. objective. the preclinical period of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies such as anticitrullinated protein antibodies (acpa) and rheumatoid factor (rf). little is known about the joint symptom profile preceding onset of ra, and whether symptoms are associated with ra autoantibodies. because first-degree relatives (fdr) of north american native (nan) ra probands exhibit multiple risk factors for development of future ra, we investigated the prevalence of joint symptoms in this high-risk population. methods. we studied 306 fdr of nan patients with ra, 323 nan controls (nc), and 293 white controls (wc) having no family history of autoimmune diseases. study subjects completed a questionnaire that asked whether they had pain, swelling, or morning stiffness in their hand joints, or in other joints. serum samples were gathered at the same time and tested for the presence of acpa, rf, and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein levels. results. in all cases, fdr were significantly more likely to report experiencing joint symptoms compared to the 2 control groups. fdr also exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of ra autoantibodies than the control groups. there were modest trends for joint symptoms to associate with ra autoantibodies, and individuals who were both acpa-positive and rf-positive had the highest prevalence of joint symptoms. conclusion. fdr of nan patients with ra have a higher prevalence of joint symptoms compared to individuals with no family history of autoimmune disease. this finding is only partially explained by a high prevalence of ra autoantibodies in the fdr.
the receptor for activated c kinase 1 (rack1) is a member of the tryptophan-aspartate repeat (wd-repeat) family of proteins and shares significant homology to the β subunit of g-proteins (gβ). rack1 adopts a seven-bladed β-propeller structure which facilitates protein binding. rack1 has a significant role to play in shuttling proteins around the cell, anchoring proteins at particular locations and in stabilising protein activity. it interacts with the ribosomal machinery, with several cell surface receptors and with proteins in the nucleus. as a result, rack1 is a key mediator of various pathways and contributes to numerous aspects of cellular function. here, we discuss rack1 gene and structure and its role in specific signaling pathways, and address how posttranslational modifications facilitate subcellular location and translocation of rack1. this review condenses several recent studies suggesting a role for rack1 in physiological processes such as development, cell migration, central nervous system (cn) function and circadian rhythm as well as reviewing the role of rack1 in disease. background: peripheral anionic site (pas) blockade of acetylcholinesterase (ache) notably affects neuronal activity and cyto-architecture, however, the mechanism(s) involved are incompletely understood. objective: we wished to specify the pas extracellular effects on specific ache mrna splice variants, delineate the consequent cellular remodeling events, and explore the inhibitory effects on interchanging rack1 interactions. methods: we exposed rat hippocampal cultured neurons to bw284c51, the peripheral anionic site inhibitor of ache, and to the non-selective ache active site inhibitor, physostigmine for studying the neuronal remodeling of ache mrna expression and trafficking. results: bw284c51 induced overexpression of both ache splice variants, yet promoted neuritic translocation of the normally rare ache-r, and retraction of ache-s mrna in an antisense-suppressible manner. bw284c51 further caused modest decreases in the expression of the scaffold protein rack1 (receptor for activated protein kinase βii), followed by drastic neurite retraction of both rack1 and the ache homologue neuroligin1, but not the tubulin-associated map2 protein. accompanying bw284c51 effects involved decreases in the fyn kinase and membrane insertion of the glutamate receptor nr2b variant and impaired glutamatergic activities of treated cells. intriguingly, molecular modeling suggested that direct, non-catalytic competition with fyn binding by the rack1-interacting ache-r variant may be involved. conclusions: our findings highlight complex neuronal ache-r/rack1 interactions and are compatible with the hypothesis that peripheral site ache inhibitors induce rack1-mediated neuronal remodeling, promoting suppressed glutamatergic neurotransmission.
group c orthobunyaviruses (family bunyaviridae, genus orthobunyavirus), discovered in the 1950s, are vector-borne human pathogens in the americas. currently there is a gap in genomic information for group c viruses. in this study, we obtained complete coding region sequences of reference strains of caraparu (carv), oriboca (oriv), marituba (mtbv) and madrid (madv) viruses, and five clinical isolates from peru and bolivia, using an unbiased de novo approach consisting of random reverse transcription, random anchored pcr amplification, and high throughput pyrosequencing. the small, medium, and large segments encode for a 235 amino acid nucleocapsid protein, an approximately 1430 amino acid surface glycoprotein polyprotein precursor, and a 2248 amino acid rna-dependent rna polymerase, respectively. additionally, the s segment encodes for an 83 amino acid non-structural protein, although this protein is truncated or silenced in some isolates. phylogenetically, three clinical isolates clustered with carv, one clustered with mtbv, and one isolate appeared to be a reassortant or a genetic drift resulted from the high variability of the medium segment which was also seen in a few other orthobunyaviruses. these data represent the first complete coding region sequences for this serocomplex of pathogenic orthobunyaviruses. the genome-wide phylogeny of reference strains is consistent with the antigenic properties of the viruses reported in the original serological studies conducted in the 1960s. comparative analysis of conserved protein regions across group c virus strains and the other orthobunyavirus groups revealed that these group c viruses contain characteristic domains of potential structural and functional significance. our results provide the basis for the developments of diagnostics, further genetic analyses, and future epidemiologic studies of group c viruses. bunyaviruses are a large family of segmented rna viruses which, like influenza virus, use a cap-snatching mechanism for transcription whereby short capped primers derived by endonucleolytic cleavage of host mrnas are used by the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase (l-protein) to transcribe viral mrnas. it was recently shown that the cap-snatching endonuclease of influenza virus resides in a discrete n-terminal domain of the pa polymerase subunit. here we structurally and functionally characterize a similar endonuclease in la crosse orthobunyavirus (lacv) l-protein. we expressed n-terminal fragments of the lacv l-protein and found that residues 1-180 have metal binding and divalent cation dependent nuclease activity analogous to that of influenza virus endonuclease. the 2.2 å resolution x-ray crystal structure of the domain confirms that lacv and influenza endonucleases have similar overall folds and identical two metal binding active sites. the in vitro activity of the lacv endonuclease could be abolished by point mutations in the active site or by binding 2,4-dioxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid (dpba), a known influenza virus endonuclease inhibitor. a crystal structure with bound dpba shows the inhibitor chelating two active site manganese ions. the essential role of this endonuclease in cap-dependent transcription was demonstrated by the loss of transcriptional activity in a rnp reconstitution system in cells upon making the same point mutations in the context of the full-length lacv l-protein. using structure based sequence alignments we show that a similar endonuclease almost certainly exists at the n-terminus of l-proteins or pa polymerase subunits of essentially all known negative strand and cap-snatching segmented rna viruses including arenaviruses (2 segments), bunyaviruses (3 segments), tenuiviruses (4–6 segments), and orthomyxoviruses (6–8 segments). this correspondence, together with the well-known mapping of the conserved polymerase motifs to the central regions of the l-protein and influenza pb1 subunit, suggests that l-proteins might be architecturally, and functionally equivalent to a concatemer of the three orthomyxovirus polymerase subunits in the order pa-pb1-pb2. furthermore, our structure of a known influenza endonuclease inhibitor bound to lacv endonuclease suggests that compounds targeting a potentially broad spectrum of segmented rna viruses, several of which are serious or emerging human, animal and plant pathogens, could be developed using structure-based optimisation.
variability in response to atypical antipsychotic drugs is due to genetic and environmental factors. cytochrome p450 (cyp) isoforms are implicated in the metabolism of drugs, while the p-glycoprotein transporter (p-gp), encoded by the abcb1 gene, may influence both the blood and brain drug concentrations. this study aimed to identify the possible associations of cyp and abcb1 genetic polymorphisms with quetiapine and norquetiapine plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) concentrations and with response to treatment. twenty-two patients with schizophrenia receiving 600 mg of quetiapine daily were genotyped for four cyp isoforms and abcb1 polymorphisms. quetiapine and norquetiapine peak plasma and csf concentrations were measured after 4 weeks of treatment. stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that abcb1 3435c > t (rs1045642), 2677g > t (rs2032582) and 1236c > t (rs1128503) polymorphisms predicted plasma quetiapine concentrations, explaining 41% of the variability (p = 0.001). furthermore, the abcb1 polymorphisms predicted 48% (p = 0.024) of the variability of the δ panss total score, with the non-carriers of the 3435tt showing higher changes in the score. these results suggest that abcb1 genetic polymorphisms may be a predictive marker of quetiapine treatment in schizophrenia. authors' objectives the main objectives were to assess the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of 'atypical' antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia in comparison with conventional antipsychotic drugs, placebo and other atypical antipsychotic drugs. the secondary objectives of the review were to investigate response in those with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, with predominantly negative symptoms or experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia.
background: tenotomy of the long head of the biceps tendon (lhbt) has been reported to provide reliable pain relief and require little postoperative rehabilitation. complications such as cosmetic deformity, decrease in elbow flexion strength, decrease in supination strength, and fatigue discomfort have been reported after tenotomy of the lhbt. purpose: to evaluate the complications of arthroscopic tenotomy of the lhbt in the shoulder–specifically, cosmetic deformity, decreased elbow flexion strength, and a cramplike arm pain–and to identify the patient-related factors that affect the rate of complications after tenotomy, such as, age, sex, involvement of the dominant arm, and body mass index (bmi). study design: case series; level of evidence, 4. methods: in sum, 132 patients were evaluated. they had a mean age of 63 years (range, 26 to 82 years) at the time of surgery and a mean follow-up of 21 months (range, 12 to 53 months). the presence of so-called popeye deformity, a cramplike arm pain at resisted elbow flexion, and strength of elbow flexion were evaluated. the development of each complication was compared by age, sex, involvement of the dominant arm, and bmi. results: of the 132 patients, 60 (45%) had popeye deformity, and it was significantly more frequent in men (76%) than women (31%) (p < .001). however, statistical analysis showed no difference in popeye deformity frequency by age, arm dominance, or bmi. male sex was found to be the only risk factor associated with the development of popeye deformity, with an odds ratio of 10.21 versus women (95% confidence interval, 3.97 to 26.27; p < .001). ten patients (8%) complained of a cramplike arm pain. elbow flexion strength decreased in 60 patients (45%), although no intergroup differences were found for elbow flexion strength. conclusion: the current study showed a 45% prevalence of popeye deformity and 8% cramplike arm pain on exertion after tenotomy of the lhbt. among patient factors such as sex, age, dominant arm relation, and body mass index, the male sex was the only factor correlated with occurrence of a popeye deformity. other factors did not show any correlation with deformity, elbow flexion strength, and cramplike arm pain. background arthroscopic management has been recommended for some superior labrum anterior and posterior (slap) lesions, but no studies have focused on patients over 50 years of age with rotator cuff tear and a type ii slap lesion. hypothesis in patients over 50 years of age with an arthroscopically confirmed lesion of the rotator cuff and a type ii slap lesion, there is no difference between (1) repair of both lesions and (2) repair of the rotator cuff tear without repair of the slap ii lesion but with a tenotomy of the long head of the biceps. study design randomized controlled clinical trial; level of evidence, 1. methods we recruited 63 patients. in 31 patients, we repaired the rotator cuff and the type ii slap lesion (group 1). in the other 32 patients, we repaired the rotator cuff and tenotomized the long head of the biceps (group 2). seven patients (2 in group 1 and 5 in group 2) were lost to final follow-up. results at a minimum 2.9 years’ follow-up, statistically significant differences were seen with respect to the university of california, los angeles (ucla) score and range of motion values. in group 1 (slap repair and rotator cuff repair), the ucla showed a statistically significant improvement from a preoperative average rating of 10.4 (range, 6–14) to an average of 27.9 (range, 24–35) postoperatively (p < .001). in group 2 (biceps tenotomy and rotator cuff repair), the ucla showed a statistically significant improvement from a preoperative average rating of 10.1 (range, 5–14) to an average of 32.1 (range, 30–35) postoperatively (p < .001) there was a statistically significant difference in total postoperative ucla scores and range of motion when comparing the 2 groups postoperatively (p < .05). conclusions there are no advantages in repairing a type ii slap lesion when associated with a rotator cuff tear in patients over 50 years of age. the association of rotator cuff repair and biceps tenotomy provides better clinical outcome compared with repair of the type ii slap lesion and the rotator cuff.
methylephedrine is generally harmless and is contained in many cough and cold preparations. likewise, chinese herbal drugs are considered to be effective and to have few side effects. a 32-year-old woman experienced ischemic stroke attributed to concomitant administration of a cough and cold preparation containing methylephedrine and a supplement containing chinese herbal drugs. computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed acute infarctions bilaterally in the cerebellum. conventional angiography and magnetic resonance angiography showed transient stenosis of the left vertebral artery. these findings suggested vasospasm or dissection, presumably related to hypertension and/or angiitis or vasoconstriction of large cerebral arteries leading to local thrombosis as a result of stasis and sympathomimetic-induced platelet activation. combining methylephedrine and chinese herbal drugs might carry a risk of stroke. background dietary supplements that contain ephedra alkaloids (sometimes called ma huang) are widely promoted and used in the united states as a means of losing weight and increasing energy. in the light of recently reported adverse events related to use of these products, the food and drug administration (fda) has proposed limits on the dose and duration of use of such supplements. the fda requested an independent review of reports of adverse events related to the use of supplements that contained ephedra alkaloids to assess causation and to estimate the level of risk the use of these supplements poses to consumers.   methods we reviewed 140 reports of adverse events related to the use of dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids that were submitted to the fda between june 1, 1997, and march 31, 1999. a standardized rating system for assessing causation was applied to each adverse event.   results thirty-one percent of cases were considered to be definitely or probably related to the use of supplements containing ephedra alkaloids, and 31 percent were deemed to be possibly related. among the adverse events that were deemed definitely, probably, or possibly related to the use of supplements containing ephedra alkaloids, 47 percent involved cardiovascular symptoms and 18 percent involved the central nervous system. hypertension was the single most frequent adverse effect (17 reports), followed by palpitations, tachycardia, or both (13); stroke (10); and seizures (7). ten events resulted in death, and 13 events produced permanent disability, representing 26 percent of the definite, probable, and possible cases.   conclusions the use of dietary supplements that contain ephedra alkaloids may pose a health risk to some persons. these findings indicate the need for a better understanding of individual susceptibility to the adverse effects of such dietary supplements.
the most confident way for treatment of hydatid cyst is surgical operation. spillage of the cyst contents during the operation is the major cause of recurrence after hydatid cyst surgery. instillation of scolicidal agent into hydatid cyst is the most commonly employed measure to prevent this complication. in the present study, the scolicidal effect of highly acidic and alkaline solutions is investigated. protoscoleces were collected aseptically from sheep livers containing hydatid cyst. acidic solutions with ph 1, 2, 3, and 4 and alkaline solutions with ph 11, 12, 13, and 14 were used for 5,10, and 15 min in the experiments. viability of protoscoleces was assessed by 0.1% eosin staining. scolicidal effect of acidic solution with ph 1 after 5 min and with ph 2 and 3 after 10 min was 100%. scolicidal effect of acidic solution with ph 2 and 3 after 5 min was 99.6% and 98.7%, respectively. acidic solution with ph 4 after 5, 10, and 15 min killed 15.5%, 21.5%, and 22.6% of protoscoleces, respectively. alkaline solution with ph 14 after 5 min and with ph 13 after 15 min killed all protoscoleces. the scolicidal effect of alkaline solution with ph 13 after 5 and 10 min was also 97.5% and 99.7%, respectively. these values for alkaline solution with ph 12 were 29.33%, 33.44% and 37.09%, respectively. the scolicidal effect of solution with ph 11 was 24.5%, 30.5%, and 31.3%, respectively. although the in vitro scolicidal effect of highly acidic or alkaline solutions was satisfactory in our study, in vivo efficacy of these solutions and also possible side effects, remain to be more investigated. hydatid disease is a parasitic disease that is treated primarily by surgery. the most important complication of surgical treatment is spillage of the contents of the cyst, leading to secondary dissemination. in this study, the effect of chlorhexidine gluconate (chx-glu) was investigated in the treatment of experimental intraperitoneal hydatidosis (iph). iph was reproduced in 100 wistar albino rats by inoculation with 1 ml of a suspension contained approximately 1500 viable protoscolices of echinococcus granulosus following determination of scolicidal activity of chlorhexidine gluconate in vitro. five minutes after protoscolex inoculation, 5 ml of the scolicidal solution was instilled into the peritoneal cavity: 0.9% nacl (control group), 4.0% chx-glu, 0.4% chx-glu, and 0.04% chx-glu. after 6 months of follow-up, the rats were sacrificed, and the number of isolated cysts, peroperative and postoperative deaths, and toxicity were evaluated. cyst formation did not occur in any of the chx-glu groups compared to the control group (p < 0.05), whereas it was detected in all of the control rats. in addition, to 4.0% chx-glu was found to be more toxic and to cause a high mortality rate compared to the 0.4% and 0.04% chx-glu groups and the control group (p < 0.05). chx-glu 0.04% was found to be the most potent, nontoxic agent; it is easily available, inexpensive, and highly potent in a short period of time at the low concentration. chx-glu 0.04% can be used safely in the treatment of intraperitoneal hydatidosis and hydatid cyst.
lipid rafts are microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids that contain specific membrane proteins. the resistance of domains to extraction by nonionic detergents at 4°c is the commonly used method to characterize these structures that are operationally defined as detergent-resistant membranes (drms). because the selectivity of different detergents in defining membrane rafts has been questioned, we have compared drms from human erythrocytes prepared with two detergents: triton x-100 and c12e8. the drms obtained presented a cholesterol/protein mass ratio three times higher than in the whole membrane. flotillin-2 was revealed in trace amounts in drms obtained with c12e8, but it was almost completely confined within the drm fraction with triton x-100. differently, stomatin was found distributed in drm and non-drm fractions for both detergents. we have also measured the order parameter (s) of nitroxide spin labels inserted into drms by means of electron paramagnetic resonance. the 5- and 16-stearic acid spin label revealed significantly higher s values for drms obtained with either triton x-100 or c12e8 in comparison to intact cells, while the difference in the s values between triton x-100 and c12e8 drms was not statistically significant. our results suggest that although the acyl chain packing is similar in drms prepared with either triton x-100 or c12e8 detergent, protein content is dissimilar, with flotillin-2 being selectively enriched in triton x-100 drms. as printed in the june 2005 issue, figure 3 of the article is wrong. the correct figure is shown below.
aims/hypothesisprolactin (prl)-stimulated beta cell proliferation is critical for maternal pancreatic beta cell mass expansion during pregnancy. however, the molecular effectors of the multiple putative signalling pathways downstream of the prl receptor (prl-r) are still elusive. survivin has been shown to be induced during pregnancy. the aim of the present study was to define the essential role of survivin in gestational beta cell mass expansion.methodsexpression of survivin was assessed in mouse islets during pregnancy and in insulinoma cells (ins-1) stimulated with prl. pregnant mice with targeted deletion of the survivin gene (also known as birc5) in beta cells were assessed to determine the essential function of survivin in maternal beta cell mass expansion. ins-1 cells stimulated with prl were used to explore the role of survivin in signalling pathways downstream of the prl-r.resultssurvivin was significantly upregulated in maternal islets during pregnancy. with prl stimulation, induction of survivin expression occurred predominantly in the nucleus and was associated with cell cycle progression to s and g2/m phase. beta cell-specific survivin-knockout pregnant mice displayed glucose intolerance, attenuated beta cell mass expansion and impaired beta cell proliferation, with significant attenuation in the increased expression of cdk4/ccnd1, e2f1, p53 (also known as trp53) and p21 (also known as cdkn1a) compared with wild-type controls during pregnancy. targeted deletion of survivin in ins-1 cells resulted in cell cycle disturbance with an arrest in g1/s phase after prl stimulation. inhibitors of akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (stat5), pim or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk), significantly decreased the expression of survivin in prl-stimulated ins-1 cells.conclusions/interpretationsurvivin directly participates in prl-mediated beta cell proliferation via akt, stat5–pim and erk signalling pathways during pregnancy. objective—diabetes results from a deficiency of functional β-cells due to both an increase in β-cell death and an inhibition of β-cell replication. the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects in susceptible individuals are mostly unknown. the objective of this study was to determine whether a gene critical for cell division and cell survival in cancer cells, survivin, might also be important for β-cells. research design and methods—we generated mice harboring a conditional deletion of survivin in pancreatic endocrine cells using mice with a pax-6-cre transgene promoter construct driving tissue-specific expression of cre-recombinase in these cells. we performed metabolic studies and immunohistochemical analyses to determine the effects of a mono- and biallelic deletion of survivin. results—selective deletion of survivin in pancreatic endocrine cells in the mouse had no discernible effects during embryogenesis but was associated with striking decreases in β-cell number after birth, leading to hyperglycemia and early-onset diabetes by 4 weeks of age. serum insulin levels were significantly decreased in animals lacking endocrine cell survivin, with relative stability of other hormones. exogenous expression of survivin in mature β-cells lacking endogenous survivin completely rescued the hyperglycemic phenotype and the decrease in β-cell mass, confirming the specificity of the survivin effect in these cells. conclusions—our findings implicate survivin in the maintenance of β-cell mass through both replication and antiapoptotic mechanisms. given the widespread involvement of survivin in cancer, a novel role for survivin may well be exploited in β-cell regulation in diseased states, such as diabetes.
the concept of a carbimazole embryopathy underlies current endocrine society advice to avoid this drug in early pregnancy, favouring propylthiouracil as an alternative for the treatment of maternal hyperthyroidism. we aimed to establish whether suspected spontaneous reporting of adverse drug reactions in the uk via the yellow card scheme supports a carbimazole embryopathy and the lack of association between propylthiouracil and congenital anomalies. all birth defects related to maternal treatment with carbimazole or propylthiouracil reported over a 47-year period via the yellow card scheme were analysed. 57 cases with 97 anomalies were reported following in utero exposure to carbimazole. these anomalies included aplasia cutis, choanal atresia, tracheo-oesophageal fistula, and patent vitellointestinal duct, which have previously been reported in association with carbimazole/methimazole exposure in utero. only 6 cases with 11 anomalies were reported for propylthiouracil, all within the last 15 years. therefore, these findings may support a carbimazole embryopathy. there are few birth defects associated with propylthiouracil, but this should be interpreted in the context of higher historical prescription rates for carbimazole. maternal thyrotoxicosis, predominantly secondary to graves' disease, affects 0.2% of all pregnancies. the endocrine society guidelines recommend the use of propylthiouracil as a first-line drug for thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy because of associations between carbimazole or methimazole and congenital anomalies. however, recent studies have highlighted the risk of severe liver injury with propylthiouracil. here, we report another case with multiple congenital anomalies following in utero exposure to carbimazole and review the literature to consider the risks and benefits of available pharmacological treatments for thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy.
mct2 is the major neuronal monocarboxylate transporter (mct) that allows the supply of alternative energy substrates such as lactate to neurons. recent evidence obtained by electron microscopy has demonstrated that mct2, like α‐amino‐3‐hydroxyl‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazole‐propionic acid (ampa) receptors, is localized in dendritic spines of glutamatergic synapses. using immunofluorescence, we show in this study that mct2 colocalizes extensively with glur2/3 subunits of ampa receptors in neurons from various mouse brain regions as well as in cultured neurons. it also colocalizes with glur2/3‐interacting proteins, such as c‐kinase‐interacting protein 1, glutamate receptor‐interacting protein 1 and clathrin adaptor protein. coimmunoprecipitation of mct2 with glur2/3 and c‐kinase‐interacting protein 1 suggests their close interaction within spines. parallel changes in the localization of both mct2 and glur2/3 subunits at and beneath the plasma membrane upon various stimulation paradigms were unraveled using an original immunocytochemical and transfection approach combined with three‐dimensional image reconstruction. cell culture incubation with ampa or insulin triggered a marked intracellular accumulation of both mct2 and glur2/3, whereas both tumor necrosis factor α and glycine (with glutamate) increased their cell surface immunolabeling. similar results were obtained using western blots performed on membrane or cytoplasm‐enriched cell fractions. finally, an enhanced lactate flux into neurons was demonstrated after mct2 translocation on the cell surface. these observations provide unequivocal evidence that mct2 is linked to ampa receptor glur2/3 subunits and undergoes a similar translocation process in neurons upon activation. mct2 emerges as a novel component of the synaptic machinery putatively linking neuroenergetics to synaptic transmission. ampa receptors mediate the majority of the fast excitatory transmission in the central nervous system. much evidence suggests that the fast trafficking of ampa receptors into and out of the postsynaptic membrane underlies changes in synaptic strength thought to be necessary for higher cognitive functions such as learning and memory. despite the abundance of research conducted in this area, a direct, real-time functional assay that measures the trafficking of native ampa receptors has been lacking. toward this aim, we use a photoreactive, irreversible antagonist of ampa receptors, anqx, to rapidly silence surface ampa receptors and investigate directly the trafficking of native ampa receptors in real time. we find that the most dynamic movement of ampa receptors occurs by lateral movement across the surface of neurons. fast cycling of surface ampa receptors with receptors from internal stores does occur but exclusively at extrasynaptic somatic sites. the cycling of synaptic ampa receptors only occurs on a much longer timescale with complete exchange requiring at least 16 hr. this cycling is not dependent on protein synthesis or action potential driven network activity. these data suggest a revised model of ampa receptor trafficking wherein a large internal store of ampa receptors exchanges rapidly with extrasynaptic somatic ampa receptors, and these newly inserted ampa receptors then travel laterally along dendrites to reside stably at synapses.
in normal subjects growth hormone (gh) and insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i) have opposing effects on glucose metabolism. active acromegaly is associated with insulin resistance (ir) and glucose intolerance although both gh and igf-i are elevated. our objective was to compare whether gh or igf-i correlates more closely with ir and glucose intolerance in acromegaly. basal serum igf-i and gh, glucose and insulin during an oral glucose tolerance test were measured in 70 normoglycemic and 44 hyperglycemic acromegalic patients (21 impaired fasting glucose, 11 impaired glucose tolerance and 12 diabetes mellitus) according to american diabetes association criteria. 55 patients were assessed before any treatment for acromegaly and 59 after surgery and/or radiotherapy (15 patients had normal igf-i after treatment). patients treated with somatostatin analogs, gh-receptor antagonists or antidiabetic drugs were excluded. ir was assessed by various basal and stimulated indices. homeostatic model assessment 2-insulin resistance (homa2-ir) index correlated more closely with igf-i (r = 0.65, p < 0.0001) than nadir (r = 0.23, p = 0.008) or random gh (r = 0.26, p = 0.002). homa2-ir correlated better with igf-i than nadir or random gh also in normoglycemic (n = 70; r = 0.74, p < 0.0001 vs. r = 0.36, p = 0.001 vs. r = 0.39, p < 0.001) and hyperglycemic patients (n = 44; r = 0.54, p = 0.0002 vs. r = 0.09, p = 0.4 vs. r = 0.14, p = 0.26). in multivariate logistic regression analysis igf-i but not gh was a significant risk factor for glucose intolerance after adjusting for age, sex, weight and acromegaly duration (or = 1.56, p = 0.01). in acromegaly igf-i correlates more closely than gh with ir. igf-i levels but not gh are associated with glucose intolerance. unlabelled insulin resistance (ir) can be induced by high amounts of growth hormone (gh).   aim to set up, in acromegaly without diabetes mellitus, a correlation between the disease activity in gh-secreting adenoma (aa) - assessed by minimum gh serum level during an oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt) - and severity of insulin resistance (ir), assessed by homa-ir index.   methods 75 out of 88 consecutive patients with acromegaly hospitalized in our department were included in this study. 13 patients proved to have diabetes mellitus and were excluded. serum glucose, gh and insulin levels were measured by immunoradiometricassay basal and at 30, 60 and 120 minutes after a 75 g ogtt in 88 patients with active or cured acromegaly. ir was assessed using homa-ir index (homa-ir=basal serum glucose (mg/dl) x basal serum insulin (mu/l)/22.5 x 18). a value over 2.5 was considered indicating ir.   results out of 75 patients without diabetes mellitus, 36 subjects (48%) were presenting with ir (34 with active disease, 2 cured). we found a significant positive correlation (r=0.56, p<0.001) between aa and homa-ir. the gh minimal level corresponding to the intersection of the exponential regression curve with the homa-ir level of 2.5 was 8.8 ng/ml, a cut-off point indicating ir with 82% specificity and 78% sensitivity. the odds ratio for developing ir becomes significant at a minimum gh level during ogtt of 2 ng/ml (odds ratio 7.6, 95% confidence interval 2-29).   conclusions the severity of ir revealed by acromegaly correlates with gh production. a gh serum level higher than 2 ng/ml during ogtt indicates an increased risk for developing ir. this cut-off level of gh can be used as one of criteria of cured disease, regarding the lack of metabolic effects.
background the need for early identification of postural abnormalities without exposing patients to constant radiation has stimulated the development of instruments aiming to measure the spinal curvatures.   objective to verify the validity, repeatability and reproducibility of angular measures of sagittal curvatures of the spine obtained using an adapted arcometer, by comparing them with cobb angles of the respective curvatures obtained by using x-rays.   methods 52 participants were submitted to two procedures designed to evaluate the thoracic and lumbar curvatures: (1) x-ray examination from which the cobb angles (ca) of both curvatures were obtained, and (2) measuring the angles with the arcometer (aa). two evaluators collected the data using the arcometer, with the rods placed at t1, t12, l1 and l5 spinous processes levels in a way as to permit linear measurements which, with aid of trigonometry, supplied the aa.   results there was a very strong and significant correlation between aa and ca (r=0.94; p<0.01), with no-significant difference (p=0.32), for the thoracic curvature. there was a strong and significant correlation for the lumbar curvature (r=0.71; p<0.01) between aa and ca, with no-significant difference (p=0.30). there is a very strong correlation between intra-evaluator and inter-evaluator aa.   conclusion it was possible to quantify reliably the thoracic and lumbar curvatures with the arcometer and it can thus be considered valid and reliable and for use in evaluating spinal curvatures in the sagittal plane. study design an observational study in which vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis, developed in this study, was used to examine lumbar curvature. the intra- and interobserver reliability of the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis and the cobb technique were compared.   objectives to evaluate the reliability of a new method of measuring lumbar lordosis and to examine the changes in the lordotic curve from 0 degree to 90 degrees flexion of the trunk.   summary of background data several different methods are used to measure lumbar lordosis. the cobb technique, based on measurement of vertebral endplates, is the method most frequently adopted for clinical diagnosis. however, because of the variations in the vertebral endplate architecture, the vertebral surface angle is difficult to identify. this reduces the reliability of the cobb technique.   methods lateral radiographs of 16 study participants were taken from the upright position to a trunk flexion of 90 degrees in 30 degrees increments. the lumbar lordotic curve was measured by three observers individually using two applications of the traditional cobb technique and the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis.   results correlation coefficients of lumbar lordosis between the two methods ranged from 0.589 to 0.772 with participants standing upright (all p < 0.05). interobserver reliability coefficients were 0.903 for vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis, 0.826 for cobb (l1-l5), and 0.784 for cobb (l1-s1), although the three measurements all revealed an excellent intraobserver reproducibility (r greater than 0.9). the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis showed the smallest mean absolute differences between any two observers' measurements (< 1.7 degrees).   conclusions the findings from this study indicate that the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis is more reliable than the cobb method for assessing lumbar lordosis. the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis also can be used to evaluate the actual lumbar curvature in outline at various angles of trunk flexion.
summaryhepatitis e, caused by the hepatitis e virus (hev), is endemic in china. however, the molecular characteristics of hev circulating in eastern china and the seroprevalence of hev infection in eastern china are relatively unknown. in this study, 25 hev strains, isolated from sporadic hepatitis e cases in eastern china, were sequenced in the rna-dependent rna polymerase region and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. these hev strains were 74.6–98.7% identical in nucleotides and were all clustered into hev genotype 4. most of them formed new sub-genotypes and revealed a high degree of genetic variance. in addition, 12,052 serum samples were collected from people of different ages, living in urban or rural areas in eastern china. anti-hev igg activity was detected in 2073 (17.20%). the prevalence of anti-hev igg significantly increased with age (p < 0.0001), ranging from 7.92% in children (<10 years old) to 21.48% among older persons (≥60 years old). moreover, statistical analysis showed that there was a significant difference between rural and urban areas, with higher prevalence for people living in rural neighborhoods (p<0.001). the prevalence of anti‐hev was assessed in 2,233 subjects aged 20–79 years in the republic of san marino in the years 1990–1991. the sera were tested by elisa and further confirmed by western blot (wb) analysis. the overall anti‐hev prevalence was 1.5%. a significant trend by age was observed. anti‐hev prevalence was 0.6% in subjects <30 years and 3.3% in those older than 70 years of age. family size larger than four persons (or = 3.8; 95% ci = 1.8–13.2) was the sole independent predictor of anti‐hev positivity in the multivariate analysis. anti‐hav and anti‐hev prevalences did not show a parallel trend by age. no association was found either between hepatitis e virus (hev) or hepatitis c virus (hcv) infections. follow‐up samples 5 years apart were available for 38 out of 54 (70%) anti‐hev elisa‐positive subjects. eight out of 22 (37%) wb‐confirmed anti‐hev–positive subjects were still anti‐hev–positive after 5 years. however, anti‐hev remained positive in all but two (75%) of the subjects with wb‐confirmed elisa positivity value of s/co ≥ 2 (cutoff 1.2), but in only 2 out of the 14 subjects (14%) with a wb‐con‐ firmed elisa positivity value of s/co < 2 (p < 0.005). none of the 16 subjects elisa‐positive but not wb‐confirmed was anti‐hev–positive 5 years apart. therefore, only a relative proportion of subjects once infected with hev maintain for at least 5 years anti‐hev antibodies. j. med. virol. 58:49–53, 1999. © 1999 wiley‐liss, inc.
abstract candida albicans forms two types of biofilm, depending upon the configuration of the mating type locus. although architecturally similar, a/α biofilms are impermeable, impenetrable, and drug resistant, whereas a/a and α/α biofilms lack these traits. the difference appears to be the result of an alternative matrix. overexpression in a/a cells of bcr1, a master regulator of the a/α matrix, conferred impermeability, impenetrability, and drug resistance to a/a biofilms. deletion of bcr1 in a/α cells resulted in the loss of these a/α-specific biofilm traits. using bcr1 overexpression in a/a cells, we screened 107 genes of interest and identified 8 that were upregulated by bcr1. when each was overexpressed in a/a biofilms, the three a/α traits were partially conferred, and when each was deleted in a/α cells, the traits were partially lost. five of the eight genes have been implicated in iron homeostasis, and six encode proteins that are either in the wall or plasma membrane or secreted. all six possess sites for o-linked and n-linked glycosylation that, like glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) anchors, can cross-link to the wall and matrix, suggesting that they may exert a structural role in conferring impermeability, impenetrability, and drug resistance, in addition to their physiological functions. the fact that in a screen of 107 genes, all 8 of the bcr1-upregulated genes identified play a role in impermeability, impenetrability, and drug resistance suggests that the formation of the a/α matrix is highly complex and involves a larger number of genes than the initial ones identified here. abstract although the fungus candida albicans is a commensal colonizer of humans, the organism is also an important opportunistic pathogen. most infections caused by c. albicans arise from organisms that were previously colonizing the host as commensals, and therefore successful establishment of colonization is a prerequisite for pathogenicity. to elucidate fungal activities that promote colonization, an analysis of the transcription profile of c. albicans cells recovered from the intestinal tracts of mice was performed. the results showed that within the c. albicans colonizing population, cells expressed genes characteristic of the laboratory-grown exponential phase and genes characteristic of post-exponential-phase cells. thus, gene expression both promoted the ability to grow rapidly (a characteristic of exponential-phase cells) and enhanced the ability to resist stresses (a characteristic of post-exponential-phase cells). similarities in gene expression in commensal colonizing cells and cells invading host tissue during disease were found, showing that c. albicans cells adopt a particular cell surface when growing within a host in both situations. in addition, transcription factors cph2p and tec1p were shown to regulate c. albicans gene expression during intestinal colonization.
backgroundthe use of foot orthoses and in-shoe wedges in cycling are largely based on theoretical benefits and anecdotal evidence. this review aimed to systematically collect all published research on this topic, critically evaluate the methods and summarise the findings.methodsstudy inclusion criteria were: all empirical studies that evaluated the effects of foot orthoses or in-shoe wedges on cycling; outcome measures that investigated physiological parameters, kinematics and kinetics of the lower limb, and power; and, published in english. studies were located by data-base searching (medline, cinahl, embase and sportdiscus) and hand-searching in february 2014. selected studies were assessed for methodological quality using a modified quality index. data were synthesised descriptively. meta-analysis was not performed as the included studies were not sufficiently homogeneous to provide a meaningful summary.resultssix studies were identified as meeting the eligibility criteria. all studies were laboratory-based and used a repeated measures design. the quality of the studies varied, with quality index scores ranging from 7 to 10 out of 14. five studies investigated foot orthoses and one studied in-shoe wedges. foot orthoses were found to increase contact area in the midfoot, peak pressures under the hallux and were perceived to provide better arch support, compared to a control. with respect to physiological parameters, contrasting findings have been reported regarding the effect foot orthoses have on oxygen consumption. further, foot orthoses have been shown to not provide effects on lower limb kinematics and perceived comfort. both foot orthoses and in-shoe wedges have been shown to provide no effect on power.conclusionin general, there is limited high-quality research on the effects foot orthoses and in-shoe wedges provide during cycling. at present, there is some evidence that during cycling foot orthoses: increase contact area under the foot and increase plantar pressures under the hallux, but provide no gains in power. based on available evidence, no definitive conclusions can be made about the effects foot orthoses have on lower limb kinematics and oxygen consumption, and the effect in-shoe wedges have on power during cycling. future well-designed studies on this topic are warranted. to validate the measurement of peak power output (ppo) using a short cycling sprint test (inertial load (il) test), we compare it to the widely accepted wingate anaerobic test (want). fifteen healthy, young, active subjects performed 2 experimental trials. in each trial, subjects warmed up and sprinted 4 times for the il test. after recovery, they cycled for 30 s at maximum capacity for the want. the experimental trial was replicated 3 d later to test for reliability. inter- and intra-day ppo measured with the il test was very reliable (r(1) = 0.99 and r(1) = 0.94, respectively). the correlation between the il and want was highly significant (r = 0.82; p < 0.001), although the absolute ppo values were markedly higher for the il test (1268 +/- 41 w vs. 786 +/- 27 w; p < 0.001). in conclusion, cycling ppo can be validly assessed with the il test. the higher ppo attained with an il test could be related to better identification of peak power, since both velocity and resistance are free to vary during the sprint in comparison with the want, where resistance is fixed. owing to the short duration of the sprint (4 s) and high intra-day reliability despite a short recovery time (180 s), the il test is optimal for repeated measurements of anaerobic performance.
escherichia coli is part of the normal microflora of the intestines of mammals. however, among the enteric pathogens, it is one of the leading causes of intestinal diseases, especially shiga toxigenic e. coli, which can cause diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis and complications like haemolytic uraemic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura. escherichia coli is considered a serious public health problem. water and fish samples were subjected to biochemical tests to confirm the presence of e. coli and by pcr to verify the presence of pathogenic strains (o157, enteropathogenic and shiga toxigenic) in water and fish (skin, gastrointestinal tract and muscles) from pay‐to‐fish ponds located in the córrego rico watershed in the northeastern region of the state of são paulo, brazil. of the 115 e. coli isolates from fish or water, five (4·34%) contained eae and stx2 genes, one had only the eae gene and two had the stx1 gene. an isolate containing the stx2 gene was also found in the water sample. in addition, eight isolates (6·95%) from the fish gastrointestinal tract contained rfbeo157:h7 (o157 gene), and three (2·61%) contained stx2 and eae genes, demonstrating the potential risk to the environment and public health. the results provide useful basic information for the proper management of these environments and animals in order to prevent faecal pollution, reducing health risks to the brazilian population. we have isolated one sorbitol-nonfermenting (snf) escherichia coli o157:h7 isolate and five sorbitolfermenting (sf) e. coli o157:h isolates that do not contain shiga toxin (stx) genes (stx). isolates originated from patients with diarrhea (n 5 4) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (hus) (n 5 2). all isolates harbored a chromosomal eae gene encoding gamma-intimin as well as the plasmid genes e-hly and etp. the e. coli o157:h7 isolate was katp and espp positive. respective sera obtained from the patient with hus contained antibodies to the o157 lipopolysaccharide antigen. the stx-negative e. coli o157:h7 isolate is genetically related to stx-positive snf e. coli o157:h7. all stx-negative sf e. coli o157:h isolates belong to the same genetic cluster and are closely related to stx-positive sf e. coli o157:h isolates. our data indicate that stx-negative e. coli o157: h7/h variants may occur at a low frequency and cannot be recognized by diagnostic methods that target stx.
this systematic review was to identify available evidence on the effectiveness of tocolysis in inhibiting preterm delivery for women with threatened extremely preterm birth, multiple gestations, and growth-restricted babies, and their infants’ outcomes. a comprehensive search using medline, embase, the cochrane library, cinahl, popline and the who global health library databases was conducted on 14 february 2014. for selection criteria, randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies that compared tocolysis treatment to placebo or no treatment were considered. selection of eligible studies, critical appraisal of the included studies, data collection, meta-analyses, and assessment of evidence quality were performed in accordance with the cochrane collaboration’s guidance and validated assessment criteria. the search identified seven studies for extremely preterm birth, in which three were randomized controlled trials (rcts) and four were non-randomized studies (non-rcts). there were no eligible studies identified for women with multiple pregnancy and growth-restricted fetuses. meta-analyses indicated no significant difference was found for the relative effectiveness of tocolytics versus placebo for prolonging pregnancy in women with extremely preterm birth (rr 1.04, 95 % ci 0.83 to 1.31) or reducing the rate of perinatal deaths (rr 2.22, 95 % ci 0.26 to 19.24). in summary, there is no evidence to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of tocolytic therapy for women with threatened extremely preterm birth, multiple gestations, and growth-restricted babies. we sought to estimate the effect of indomethacin on duration of pregnancy in women with dilated cervix between 14 (0)/ (7) to 25 (6)/ (7) weeks. demographics, risk factors, and outcomes were compared in women 14 (0)/ (7) to 25 (6)/ (7) weeks with a dilated cervix > or = 1 cm who received indomethacin versus no indomethacin therapy, stratified for cerclage. primary outcome was interval from presentation until delivery. of 222 singleton gestations, 68 (31%) received indomethacin. in unadjusted and adjusted analyses, no significant differences were observed in interval from presentation to delivery and preterm birth < 28, < 32, or < 35 weeks comparing the indomethacin and no indomethacin groups, even after stratification for cerclage. in multivariate logistic regression analysis limited to women receiving cerclage, preterm birth < 32 weeks (odds ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.26, 1.25) and < 35 weeks (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.23, 1.14) suggested a possible but not significant benefit for indomethacin use. indomethacin therapy in women with dilated cervix at 14 (0)/ (7) to 25 (6)/ (7) weeks, regardless of cerclage or not, had no effect on pregnancy outcomes.
acid mine drainage (amd) is a global problem leading to the acidification of freshwaters, as well as contamination by heavy metals. the ability of humic substances (hs) such as humic acid (ha) to decrease toxicity of heavy metals is widely known, whereas limited studies have examined the ability of hs to decrease toxicity linked with multiple stressors such as those associated with amd. this study investigated the ability of ha to decrease acute toxicity defined as morbidity and ventilation frequency (measured via the time elapsed for ten operculum movements) in eastern rainbowfish (melanotaenia splendida splendida) exposed to the multiple stressors of amd-driven heavy metal concentrations, together with low ph. water from the mount morgan open pit (a now closed gold and copper mine site), located at mount morgan, central queensland, australia, was used as the amd source. fish were exposed to zero per cent (ph 7.3), two per cent (ph 6.7), three per cent (ph 5.7) and four per cent (ph 4.6) amd in the presence of 0, 10 and 20mg/l aldrich humic acid (aha) over 96h. ha was shown to significantly decrease the acute toxicity of amd and its adverse effects on ventilation frequency. these results are important in showing that ha can influence toxicity of metal mixtures and low ph, thus indicating a potential role for ha in decreasing toxicity of multiple environmental stressors more widely, and possible value as a rehabilitation aid. humic substances (hs) have been shown to decrease the toxicity of environmental stressors, but knowledge of their ability to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors such as metal mixtures and low ph associated with acid mine drainage (amd) is still limited. the present study investigated the ability of hs to decrease toxicity of amd to mayflies (atalophlebia spp.). the amd was collected from the mount morgan (mount morgan, queensland, australia) open pit. mayflies were exposed to concentrations of amd at 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% in the presence of 0 mg/l, 10 mg/l, and 20 mg/l aldrich humic acid (aha). a u-shaped response was noted in all aha treatments, with higher rates of mortality recorded in the 2% and 3% dilutions compared with 4%. this result was linked with increased precipitates in the lower concentrations. a follow-up trial showed significantly higher concentrations of precipitates in the 2% and 3% amd dilutions in the 0 mg/l aha treatment and higher precipitates in the 2% amd, 10 mg/l and 20 mg/l aha, treatments. humic substances were shown to significantly increase survival of mayflies exposed to amd by up to 50% in the 20 mg/l aha treatment. humic substances may have led to increased survival after amd exposure through its ability to influence animal physiology and complex heavy metals. these results are valuable in understanding the ability of hs to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors.
cellular flice-inhibitory protein (c-flip) proteins are known as potent inhibitors of death receptor-mediated apoptosis by interfering with caspase-8 activation at the death-inducing signaling complex (disc). among the three human isoforms, c-fliplong, c-flipshort and c-flipr, the latter isoform is poorly characterized. we report here the characterization of murine c-flipr and show that it is the only short c-flip isoform expressed in mice. by generating several mutants, we demonstrate that both death effector domains (deds) are required for disc binding and the antiapoptotic function of c-flipr. surprisingly, the c-terminal tail is important for both protein stability and disc recruitment. three-dimensional modeling of c-flipr revealed a substantial similarity of the overall structures and potential interaction motifs with the viral flip mc159. we found, however, that c-flipr uses different structural motifs for its disc recruitment. whereas mc159 interferes with interaction and self-oligomerization of the disc component fadd by its extensive hydrophilic surface, a narrow hydrophobic patch of c-flipr on the surface of ded2 is crucial for disc association. thus, despite the presence of similar tandem deds, viral and cellular flips inhibit apoptosis by remarkably divergent mechanisms. death receptor signaling is initiated by the assembly of the deathinducing signaling complex, which culminates in the activation of the initiator caspase, either caspase-8 or caspase-10. a family of viral and cellular proteins, known as flip, plays an essential role in the regulation of death receptor signaling. viral flip (v-flip) and short cellular flip (c-flips) inhibit apoptosis by interfering with death receptor signaling. the structure and mechanisms of v-flip and c-flips remain largely unknown. here we report a high resolution crystal structure of mc159, a v-flip derived from the molluscum contagiosum virus, which is a member of the human poxvirus family. unexpectedly, the two tandem death effector domains (deds) of mc159 rigidly associate with each other through a hydrophobic interface. structure-based sequence analysis suggests that this interface is conserved in the tandem deds from other v-flip, c-flips, and caspase-8 and -10. strikingly, the overall packing arrangement between the two deds of mc159 resembles that between the caspase recruitment domains of apaf-1 and caspase-9. in addition, each ded of mc159 contains a highly conserved binding motif on the surface, to which loss-of-function mutations in mc159 map. these observations, in conjunction with published evidence, reveal significant insights into the function of v-flip and suggest a mechanism by which v-flip and c-flips inhibit death receptor signaling.
the use of wireless hand held devices is becoming popular in healthcare applications for data management. while the concept is attractive, difficulties encountered by nurses included the small size of the device, problems in fitting current data collection forms into one screen of a handheld device and data entry using the 'garfiti' option. it appears that prior studies, while highlighting the importance of wireless applications in healthcare, failed to ascertain factors that determine the adoption of these applications in hopitals. this study conducted a set of interviews to investigate the factors of adoption of wireless applications by nurses in order to enhace heathcare data management. preliminary findings of these interviews are presented here. nearly two decades ago, british neurologist and author (awakenings and the man who mistook his wife for a hat), dr. oliver sacks, resolved health care’s current dilemma when he said: “there is only one cardinal rule in medicine: one must always listen to the patient.” if only it were that simple. and yet, for nursing—typically considered the “caring” constituency—it is that simple. problem is, nursing, as with every other health care constituency, has to serve several masters. the cruelest master of them all? the bottom line. unfortunately, nursing must all too often subjugate the ideal of listening to the patient to the reality of doing what is cost-effective. fortunately, there is a means to that ideal end—information technology (it).
faults injection attacks have become a hot topic in the domain of smartcards. this work exposes a source code-base simulation approach designed to evaluate the robustness of high-level secured implementations against single and multiple fault injections. in addition to an unprotected crt-rsa implementation, we successfully attacked two countermeasures with the high-level simulation under the data fault model. we define a filtering criterion that operates on found attacks and we refine our simulation analysis accordingly. we introduce a broader fault model that consists in skipping c lines of code and exhibit benefits of such high-level fault model in term of simulation performance and attack coverage. abstract. we present some observations on public-key cryptosystems that use the chinese remaindering algorithm. our results imply that careless implementations of such systems could be vulnerable. only one faulty signature, in some explained context, is enough to recover the secret key.
the usefulness of telemedicine has been discussed in recent years. however, preconceptions about telemedicine have been less studied, despite the fact that they could change patient engagement. we aim to describe the standpoints of patients, physicians, and pharmacists concerning its use for managing diabetes mellitus type 2 (t2dm). in this study, 1,036 patients, 1,030 physicians, and 475 pharmacists completed a questionnaire. although 9.8 percent and 28.3 percent of patients and physicians had used telemedical resources, none of the pharmacists reported experience in telemedicine. most patients and physicians with experience in telemedicine considered that telemedicine had helped to reduce the use of health resources and optimized management of t2dm. health professionals underestimated the patients’ doubts about t2dm-related complications. compared with patients, physicians and pharmacists gave greater importance to applications dealing with lifestyle habits (p < 0.001). the observed discrepancies between health professionals and patients highlight the importance of improving patients’ knowledge about t2dm and instilling lifestyle habits. congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and hypertension are common causes of hospitalization in the elderly. short-term postdischarge clinical outcomes regarding compliance, symptom control, readmission, functional status, and mortality rates are in need of improvement. this observational study documents the results of a home-based case-managed telemedicine (cmtm) program delivered over a 2-month period postdischarge. a population of 851, predominantly elderly (over age 60), recently discharged patients were enrolled in the program. they received a nurse visit up to 3 times/week and home telemedicine monitoring (weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood glucose, and oximeter recordings) on a daily basis. patient education was provided by the nurse and reinforced through telemedicine. compliance rates, quality of life parameters, patient satisfaction with telemedicine, and data regarding nine quality of care measures (qcm), hospital readmission, and mortality rates were documented. patient demographics and outcomes of care were analyzed. there were 68% females and 56% african americans. the readmission rate was 13% and mortality 2%. treatment goals were met in 67%, patient compliance rate was 77%, and the average improvement in the nine qcm indicators was 66%. a majority of patients showed improved quality of health perception, better disease understanding, and high satisfaction rates with telemedicine. this is one of the larger observational studies in a predominantly elderly patient population enrolled in a cmtm program, to date. this model of care was well accepted by the elderly and produced excellent short-term clinical outcomes.
backgroundnearly four million neonatal deaths occur annually in the world despite existing evidence-based knowledge with the potential to prevent many of these deaths. effective knowledge translation (kt) could help to bridge this know-do gap in global health. the aim of this study was to explore aspects of kt at the primary healthcare level in a northern province in vietnam.methodssix focus-group discussions were conducted with primary healthcare staff members who provided neonatal care in districts that represented three types of geographical areas existing in the province (urban, rural, and mountainous). recordings were transcribed verbatim, translated into english, and analyzed using content analysis.resultswe identified three main categories of importance for kt. healthcare staff used several channels for acquisition and management of knowledge (1), but none appeared to work well. participants preferred formal training to reading guideline documents, and they expressed interest in interacting with colleagues at higher levels, which rarely happened. in some geographical areas, traditional medicine (2) seemed to compete with evidence-based practices, whereas in other areas it was a complement. lack of resources, low frequency of deliveries and, poorly paid staff were observed barriers to keeping skills at an adequate level in the healthcare context (3).conclusionsthis study indicates that primary healthcare staff work in a context that to some extent enables them to translate knowledge into practice. however, the established and structured healthcare system in vietnam does constitute a base where such processes could be expected to work more effectively. to accelerate the development, thorough considerations over the current situation and carefully targeted actions are required. this randomized controlled study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational program entitled 'capacity building for community leaders in a healthy living environment,' and to assess the usefulness of a participatory style of education and the applicability of an intersectoral approach in the educational process. an intervention group and a control group (consisting of 150 and 154 community leaders, respectively) were both evaluated, after the intervention group took part in a 5-day participatory-style educational program. healthy living environment promotion competency (hpc) was evaluated by an instrument consisted of four competency areas: identifying the steps required for a healthy living environment; understanding the principles to reduce potential health risks; providing public health management to improve the living environment; and applying the principles of health communication skills. scores between the intervention and control groups were examined to identify changes between the baseline and post-intervention periods. a qualitative evaluation of the educational program by participants and facilitators was conducted to assess the appropriateness of the intervention. the results indicated significant increases in the total hpc score and scores of individual hpc competency areas in the intervention group. thus, the effectiveness of a capacity building program for community leaders in a healthy living environment was demonstrated. qualitative evaluation revealed that the participatory-style and intersectoral collaboration approach facilitated the educational process. community leaders, who are representatives of various sectors and mass organizations within the community, can be important implementers in the promotion of a healthy living environment.
boule, the ancestor of the daz (deleted in azoospermia) gene family, in most organisms is mainly involved in male meiosis. the present study investigates the effects of the plasticizer dehp (50mg/kg body weight) and herbicide butachlor (0.39mg/l) on male rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) for a 10-day period in two independent experiments. the results showed that plasma testosterone (t) concentrations were significantly lower in fish exposed to either dehp or butachlor compared to the control fish (p<0.05). fish showed a significantly elevated hepatosomatic index (hsi) in the butachlor treatment (p<0.05). however, no significant difference was observed in hsi values in the dehp treatment (p>0.05). in addition, no significant differences were found in the gonadosomatic index (gsi) in both dehp and butachlor treatments (p>0.05). histologically, testes of male trout in the control groups were well differentiated and filled with large numbers of cystic structures containing spermatozoa. in contrast, the testes of male trout contained mostly spermatocytes with few spermatozoa in both treated group, suggesting that dehp and butachlor may inhibit the progression of meiosis. also, boule gene expression was significantly lower in the testes of male trout affected by dehp and butachlor in comparison with their control groups (p<0.05), which confirmed the meiotic arrest in affected trout. based on the results, the present study demonstrated that dehp and butachlor can inhibit the progression of spermatogenesis in male trout, potentially by causing an arrest of meiosis, maybe due to down-regulation of boule gene expression through t and/or igf1 via erk1/2 signaling in t-independent pathways. in addition, these results confirmed that boule can be considered as a predictive marker to assess meiotic efficiency. the deleted in azoospermia (daz) genes encode potential rna-binding proteins that are expressed exclusively in prenatal and postnatal germ cells and are strong candidates for human fertility factors. here we report the identification of an additional member of the daz gene family, which we have called boule. with the identification of this gene, it is clear that the human daz gene family contains at least three members: daz, a y-chromosome gene cluster that arose 30–40 million years ago and whose deletion is linked to infertility in men; dazl, the “father” of daz, a gene that maps to human chromosome 3 and has homologs required for both female and male germ cell development in other organisms; and boule, a gene that we propose is the “grandfather” of daz and maps to human chromosome 2. human and mouse boule resemble the invertebrate meiotic regulator boule, the proposed ortholog of daz, in sequence and expression pattern and hence likely perform a similar meiotic function. in contrast, the previously identified human daz and dazl are expressed much earlier than boule in prenatal germ stem cells and spermatogonia; dazl also is expressed in female germ cells. these data suggest that homologs of the daz gene family can be grouped into two subfamilies (boule and dazl) and that members of the daz family evolved from an ancestral meiotic regulator, boule, to assume distinct, yet overlapping, functions in germ cell development.
dir1 is a lipid transfer protein (ltp) postulated to complex with and/or chaperone a signal(s) to distant leaves during systemic acquired resistance (sar) in arabidopsis. dir1 was detected in phloem sap-enriched petiole exudates collected from wild-type leaves induced for sar, suggesting that dir1 gains access to the phloem for movement from the induced leaf. occasionally the defective in induced resistance1 (dir1-1) mutant displayed a partially sar-competent phenotype and a dir1-sized band in protein gel blots was detected in dir1-1 exudates suggesting that a highly similar protein, dir1-like (at5g48490), may contribute to sar. recombinant protein studies demonstrated that dir1 polyclonal antibodies recognize dir1 and dir1-like. homology modeling of dir1-like using the dir1-phospholipid crystal structure as template, provides clues as to why the dir1-1 mutant is rarely sar-competent. the contribution of dir1 and dir1-like during sar was examined using an agrobacterium-mediated transient expression-sar assay and an estrogen-inducible dir1-egfp/dir1-1 line. we provide evidence that upon sar induction, dir1 moves down the leaf petiole to distant leaves. our data also suggests that dir1-like displays a reduced capacity to move to distant leaves during sar and this may explain why dir1-1 is occasionally sar-competent. abietane diterpenoids are major constituents of conifer resins that have important industrial and medicinal applications. however, their function in plants is poorly understood. here we show that dehydroabietinal (da), an abietane diterpenoid, is an activator of systemic acquired resistance (sar), which is an inducible defense mechanism that is activated in the distal, non-colonized, organs of a plant that has experienced a local foliar infection. da was purified as a sar-activating factor from vascular sap of arabidopsis thaliana leaves treated with a sar-inducing microbe. locally applied da is translocated through the plant and systemically induces the accumulation of salicylic acid (sa), an important activator of defense, thus leading to enhanced resistance against subsequent infections. the npr1 (non-expressor of pr genes1), fmo1 (flavin-dependent monooxygenase1) and dir1 (defective in induced resistance1) genes, which are critical for biologically induced sar, are also required for the da-induced sar, which is further enhanced by azelaic acid, a defense priming molecule. in response to the biological induction of sar, da in vascular sap is redistributed into a sar-inducing 'signaling da' pool that is associated with a trypsin-sensitive high molecular weight fraction, a finding that suggests that da-orchestrated sar involves a vascular sap protein(s).
we adopt a susceptible-infected-susceptible (sis) model on a barabási and albert (ba) network to investigate the effects of different vaccine subsidization policies. the goal is to control the prevalence of the disease given a limited supply and voluntary uptake of vaccines. the results show a uniform subsidization policy is always harmful and increases the prevalence of the disease, because the lower degree individuals’ demand for vaccine crowds out the higher degree individuals’ demand. in the absence of an effective uniform policy, we explore a targeted subsidization policy which relies on a proxy variable instead of individuals’ connectivity. findings show a poor proxy-based targeted program can still increase the disease prevalence and become a policy trap. the results are robust to general scale-free networks. the term "herd immunity" is widely used but carries a variety of meanings. some authors use it to describe the proportion immune among individuals in a population. others use it with reference to a particular threshold proportion of immune individuals that should lead to a decline in incidence of infection. still others use it to refer to a pattern of immunity that should protect a population from invasion of a new infection. a common implication of the term is that the risk of infection among susceptible individuals in a population is reduced by the presence and proximity of immune individuals (this is sometimes referred to as "indirect protection" or a "herd effect"). we provide brief historical, epidemiologic, theoretical, and pragmatic public health perspectives on this concept.
in the present study, glial cell responses to spiral ganglion neuron (sgn) degeneration were evaluated using a murine model of auditory neuropathy. ouabain, a well-known na,k-atpase inhibitor, has been shown to induce sgn degeneration while sparing hair cell function. in addition to selectively removing type i sgns, ouabain leads to hyperplasia and hypertrophy of glia-like cells in the injured auditory nerves. as the transcription factor sox2 is predominantly expressed in proliferating and undifferentiated neural precursors during neurogenesis, we sought to examine sox2 expression patterns following sgn injury by ouabain. real-time rt-pcr and western blot analyses of cochlea indicated a significant increase in sox2 expression by 3 days post-treatment with ouabain. cells incorporating bromodeoxyuridine (brdu) and expressing sox2 were counted in the auditory nerves of control and ouabain-treated ears. the glial phenotype of sox2+ cells was identified by two neural glial markers: s100 and sox10. the number of sox2+ glial cells significantly increased at 3 days post-treatment and reached its maximum level at 7 days post-treatment. similarly, the number of brdu+ cells increased at 3 and 7 days post-treatment in the injured nerves. quantitative analysis with dual-immunostaining procedures indicated that about 70% of brdu+ cells in the injured nerves were sox2+ glial cells. these results demonstrate that up-regulation of sox2 expression is associated with increased cell proliferation in the auditory nerve after injury. the mammalian cochlea is innervated by two classes of sensory neurons. type i neurons make up 90–95% of the cochlear nerve and contact single inner hair cells to provide acoustic analysis as we know it. in contrast, the far less numerous type ii neurons arborize extensively among outer hair cells (ohcs) and supporting cells. their scarcity and smaller calibre axons have made them the subject of much speculation, but little experimental progress for the past 50 years. here we record from type ii fibres near their terminal arbors under ohcs to show that they receive excitatory glutamatergic synaptic input. the type ii peripheral arbor conducts action potentials, but the small and infrequent glutamatergic excitation indicates a requirement for strong acoustic stimulation. furthermore, we show that type ii neurons are excited by atp. exogenous atp depolarized type ii neurons, both directly and by evoking glutamatergic synaptic input. these results prove that type ii neurons function as cochlear afferents, and can be modulated by atp. the lesser magnitude of synaptic drive dictates a fundamentally different role in auditory signalling from that of type i afferents.
objective the impact of neuronal cell loss associated with alzheimer's disease (ad) on the network organization of the brain is poorly understood. here we investigated whether modifications in resting-state functional connectivity (fc) are associated with cognitive function of ad patients.   methods high-density electroencephalograms (eegs) were obtained from patients with early stages of ad and elderly healthy controls. cortical oscillations were reconstructed with an adaptive spatial filter. maps of imaginary coherence (ic) between brain areas were compared between groups and correlated with cognitive performance.   results parietal and medial temporal lobes of ad patients showed a disruption of alpha band fc to the rest of the brain. however, an adaptive extension of the language network to the right hemisphere could be observed in ad patients and was correlated with better verbal fluency. a shift of fc from alpha frequencies to theta frequencies could be observed in a memory network and was associated with better verbal memory performance.   conclusions not only dysfunctional but also adaptive network reorganization occurs in early ad.   significance the network mechanisms for preserved cognitive functioning may inform novel treatment strategies for ad in the future. background and purpose two mechanisms for recovery from aphasia, repair of damaged language networks and activation of compensatory areas, have been proposed. in this study, we investigated whether both mechanisms or one instead of the other take place in the brain of recovered aphasic patients.   methods using blood oxygenation level-dependent functional mri (fmri), we studied cortical language networks during lexical-semantic processing tasks in 7 right-handed aphasic patients at least 5 months after the onset of left-hemisphere stroke and had regained substantial language functions since then.   results we found that in the recovered aphasic patient group, functional language activity significantly increased in the right hemisphere and nonsignificantly decreased in the left hemisphere compared with that in the normal group. bilateral language networks resulted from partial restitution of damaged functions in the left hemisphere and activation of compensated (or recruited) areas in the right hemisphere. failure to restore any language function in the left hemisphere led to predominantly right hemispheric networks in some individuals. however, better language recovery, at least for lexical-semantic processing, was observed in individuals who had bilateral rather than right hemisphere-predominant networks.   conclusions the results indicate that the restoration of left-hemisphere language networks is associated with better recovery and inversely related to activity in the compensated or recruited areas of the right hemisphere.
bone morphogenetic protein (bmp) receptors mediate a diverse range of signals to regulate both development and disease. bmp activity has been linked to both tumor promoting and suppressive functions in both tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment. we sought to investigate the requirement for bmpr2 in stromal fibroblasts during mammary tumor formation and metastasis. we utilized fsp1 (fibroblast specific protein‐1) promoter driven cre to genetically delete bmpr2 in mice expressing the mmtv.pyvmt mammary carcinoma oncogene. we found that abrogation of stromal bmpr2 expression via fsp1 driven cre resulted in increased tumor metastasis. additionally, similar to epithelial bmpr2 abrogation, stromal loss of bmpr2 results in increased inflammatory cell infiltration. we proceeded to isolate and establish fibroblast cell lines without bmpr2 and found a cell autonomous increase in inflammatory cytokine secretion. fibroblasts were co‐implanted with syngeneic tumor cells and resulted in accelerated tumor growth and increased metastasis when fibroblasts lacked bmpr2. we observed that the loss of bmpr2 results in increased chemokine expression, which facilitates inflammation by a sustained increase in myeloid cells. the chemokines increased in bmpr2 deleted cells correlated with poor outcome in human breast cancer patients. we conclude that bmpr2 has tumor suppressive functions in the stroma by regulating inflammation. initiation of bmp signaling is dependent upon activation of type i bmp receptor by constitutively active type ii bmp receptor. three type ii bmp receptors have been identified; acvr2a and acvr2b serve as receptors for bmps and for activin‐like ligands whereas bmpr‐ii functions only as a bmp receptor. as bmp signaling is required for endochondral ossification and loss of either acvr2a or acvr2b is not associated with deficits in limb development, we hypothesized that bmpr‐ii would be essential for bmp signaling during skeletogenesis. we removed bmpr‐ii from early limb mesoderm by crossing bmpr‐ii floxed mice with those carrying the prx1‐cre transgene. mice lacking limb expression of bmpr‐ii have normal skeletons that could not be distinguished from control littermates. from these data, we conclude that bmpr‐ii is not required for endochondral ossification in the limb where loss of bmpr‐ii may be compensated by bmp utilization of acvr2a and acvr2b. genesis, 00:1‐6, 2011. © 2011 wiley‐liss, inc.
the effects of stress upon emotionality, and of emotionality upon the open field activity of rats have now been studied for over four decades. controversy remains however regarding the degree to which stress alters behavior, and the direction of that change. one reason for this is the absence of an adequate behavioral definition of stress. the present series of experiments demonstrates a standard relatively nontraumatic stress induction procedure which may be used in conjunction with open field testing. pre-exposure to moderately intense light and white noise facilitated open field activity as measured by initial activity, lowered defecation scores, and supplementary measures (rearing, grooming, center field penetration). further parametric, psychoendocrine, and pharmacological studies characterized the nature of the facilitation, its time course, and its modification by other manipulations. our results suggest the initial behavioral response to stress in an open field is activation. previous studies may have differed in their results relating stress and behavior because of subtle procedural distinctions, some of which may be identified using the present technique. the relationship of open-field behaviors (latency, ambulation, rearing, and defecation) and adrenal weight and adrenal ascorbic acid (aaa) was investigated. 38 male sprague-dawley rats received one daily trial in the open field for 4 days. measures of adrenal weight and aaa were subsequently obtained. correlations between variables indicated no meaningful relationship between emotional defecation and adrenal responses. rearing correlated significantly with aaa. latency was significantly related with adrenal weight. these results are consistent with recent studies investigating performance of emotional ss on escape-avoidance conditioning and cer behavior.
elevated concentrations of atmospheric co2 and tropospheric o3 will profoundly influence future forest productivity, but our understanding of these influences over the long-term is poor. leaves are key indicators of productivity and we measured the mass, area, and nitrogen concentration of leaves collected in litter traps from 2002 to 2008 in three young northern temperate forest communities exposed to elevated co2 and/or elevated o3 since 1998. on average, the overall effect of elevated co2 (+co2 and +co2+o3 versus ambient and +o3) was to increase leaf mass by 36% whereas the overall effect of elevated o3 was to decrease leaf mass by 13%, with similar effects on stand leaf area. however, there were important co2 × o3 × year interactions wherein some treatment effects on leaf mass changed dramatically relative to ambient from 2002 to 2008. for example, stimulation by the +co2 treatment decreased (from +52 to +25%), whereas the deleterious effects of the +o3 treatment increased (from −5 to −18%). in comparison, leaf mass in the +co2+o3 treatment was similar to ambient throughout the study. forest composition influenced these responses: effects of the +o3 treatment on community-level leaf mass ranged from +2 to −19%. these findings are evidence that community composition, stand development processes, co2, and o3 strongly interact. changes in leaf nitrogen concentration were inconsistent, but leaf nitrogen mass (g m−2) was increased by elevated co2 (+30%) and reduced by elevated o3 (−16%), consistent with observations that nitrogen cycling is accelerated by elevated co2 but retarded by elevated o3. in this review i am drawing attention to some constraints and biases in co2 enrichment experiments and the analysis of data in the literature. conclusions drawn from experimental works differ when the data are grouped in a way such that the relative frequency of test conditions does not determine the emerging trends, for instance unrealistically strong co2-'fertilization' effects, which are in conflict with some basic ecological principles. i suggest separating three test conditions: uncoupled systems (plants not depending in a natural nutrient cycle) (i); expanding systems, in which plants are given ample space and time to explore otherwise limited resources (ii); and fully coupled systems in which the natural nutrient cycling governs growth at steady-state leaf area index (lai) and fine root renewal (iii). data for 10 type iii experiments yield rather moderate effects of elevated co2 on plant biomass production, if any. in steady-state grassland, the effects are water-related; in closed tree stands, initial effects decline rapidly with time. plant-soil coupling (soil conditions) deserves far greater attention than plant-atmosphere coupling (co2 enrichment technology).
the effect of the thyroid hormone l-3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (t3) on the expression of icam-1, a cell surface glycoprotein playing a pivotal role in inflammatory responses, was investigated. in ecv 304 cells, t3 (30 nmol/l) markedly increased icam-1 protein expression, with a peak after 24 h of treatment. ecv 304 human cells express both α1 and β1 t3 receptors. in an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to the induction of the icam-1 gene by t3, we have studied the effects of a synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, and of a sesquiterpene lactone, parthenolide, on this t3-stimulated expression of icam-1. our results demonstrate a repressive effect of dexamethasone and parthenolide on the expression of the protein icam-1 stimulated by t3. both anti-inflammatory compounds interfere with this t3-mediated pathway in a dose-dependent manner. the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (vcam-1) is increased in immune-mediated diseases. these adhesion molecules promote the adherence of inflammatory cells to parenchymal target cells. we have examined the effect of immunosuppressants on the expression of icam-1 and vcam-1 in a renal tubular epithelial cell line. we found that dexamethasone (4-40 micrograms/ml), the azathioprine metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (10-100 micrograms/ml) and cyclosporine a (0.1-1 microgram/ml) have no effect on the basal and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha- or interleukin-1-stimulated expression of these adhesion molecules. we conclude that these immunosuppressants do not directly influence the expression of icam-1 and vcam-1 by renal tubular epithelium.
primary cns melanomas are rare and they constitute about 1% of all cases of melanomas and 0.07% of all brain tumors. these tumors are aggressive in nature and may metastasise to other organs. till date less than 25 cases have been reported in the literature. the primary treatment for local intraparenchymal tumours is complete resection and/or radiotherapy and it is associated with good survival. however once there is disease spread to leptomeninges the overall median survival is around 10 weeks. in this case report we describe a primary intracranial melanoma without any dural attachment in 16-year-old boy who had radical excision of the tumor followed by radiotherapy who eventually had rapidly developed leptomeningeal disease and review the literature with a focus on the clinic pathological, radiological, and treatment options. primary central nervous system (cns) melanoma is a type of rare and aggressive tumor that can easily spread to the leptomeninges, and in fact, leptomeningeal metastasis is one of the most serious complications in patients with this carcinoma. prognosis is extremely poor if a cns melanoma has metastasized, and there are no effective treatments. here, we present a case of a 37-year-old woman who presented with horizontal diplopia and progressive headache. magnetic resonance imaging findings were consistent with the diagnosis of melanoma. the results of cytological examination of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) showed malignant cells characteristic of melanoma. no extracranial lesions were observed. all of the available evidence confirmed a diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases from a primary cns melanoma. the patient received aggressive treatment, which consisted of concurrent radiotherapy and weekly intra-csf methotrexate (mtx) followed by adjuvant monthly intra-csf mtx. her survival time was 13 months after diagnosis. this case report suggests that the modality of concurrent radiotherapy and weekly intra-csf mtx followed by adjuvant monthly intra-csf mtx may be used as the mainstay of treatment for such patients.
the need for models that recapitulate liver physiology is perceived for drug development, study of liver disease and bioartificial liver support. the bipotent cell line heparg constitutes an efficient surrogate of liver function, yet its differentiated status relies on high concentrations of dmso, which may compromise the study of drug metabolism and limit the applicability of this hepatic model. herein, we present a three-dimensional (3d) strategy for the differentiation of heparg based on alginate microencapsulation of cell spheroids and culture in dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso)-free conditions. a ratio of 2.9:1 hepatocyte-like to biliary-like cells was obtained in the 3d culture, with an improvement of 35.9 % in the hepatocyte differentiation when compared with two-dimensional (2d) cultures. the expression of the hepatic identity genes hnf4α and pxr in 3d cultures was comparable to 2d differentiated cultures, while the expression of homeostatic-associated genes albumin and carbamoyl phosphate synthase 1 was higher in 3d. moreover, the spheroids presented a polarized organization, exhibiting an interconnected bile canalicular network and excretory functionality, assessed by specific activity of mrp2. importantly, despite variability in basal gene expression levels, the activity of the phase i enzymes cytochrome p450 family 3, subfamily a, polypeptide 4 and cytochrome p450 family 1, subfamily a, polypeptide 2 upon induction was comparable to differentiated 2d cultures and albumin production and ammonia detoxification were enhanced in 3d. the presented model is suitable for toxicological applications, as it allows high throughput analysis of multiple compounds in a dmso-free setting. due to the high xenobiotic metabolism and maintenance of biosynthetic functions, the applicability of this model might be broadened to understand liver physiology and for bioartificial liver applications. cancer cells in poorly vascularized tumor regions need to adapt to an unfavorable metabolic microenvironment. as distance from supplying blood vessels increases, oxygen and nutrient concentrations decrease and cancer cells react by stopping cell cycle progression and becoming dormant. as cytostatic drugs mainly target proliferating cells, cancer cell dormancy is considered as a major resistance mechanism to this class of anti-cancer drugs. therefore, substances that target cancer cells in poorly vascularized tumor regions have the potential to enhance cytostatic-based chemotherapy of solid tumors. with three-dimensional growth conditions, multicellular tumor spheroids (mcts) reproduce several parameters of the tumor microenvironment, including oxygen and nutrient gradients as well as the development of dormant tumor regions. we here report the setup of a 3d cell culture compatible high-content screening system and the identification of nine substances from two commercially available drug libraries that specifically target cells in inner mcts core regions, while cells in outer mcts regions or in 2d cell culture remain unaffected. we elucidated the mode of action of the identified compounds as inhibitors of the respiratory chain and show that induction of cell death in inner mcts core regions critically depends on extracellular glucose concentrations. finally, combinational treatment with cytostatics showed increased induction of cell death in mcts. the data presented here shows for the first time a high-content based screening setup on 3d tumor spheroids for the identification of substances that specifically induce cell death in inner tumor spheroid core regions. this validates the approach to use 3d cell culture screening systems to identify substances that would not be detectable by 2d based screening in otherwise similar culture conditions.
