background most us adolescents do not meet guidelines of at least 60 daily minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity. in addition, sedentary behaviors among this age group are of increasing concern. this study examined the association of movement behaviors with cardiovascular fitness among us adolescents.   methods data from the 2012 nhanes national youth fitness survey were used to assess the association of movement behaviors (physical activity, sedentary time, screen time) with cardiovascular fitness among adolescent males and females. multiple logistic regressions were used to test the independent and interactive effects of movement behaviors on cardiovascular fitness.   results among females, physical activity was directly associated with cardiovascular fitness; no significant association was observed between sedentary behaviors and cvf. among males, sedentary time moderated the relationship between physical activity and cardiovascular fitness, such that a significant, direct association was only observed among those with high sedentary time (or: 5.01; 95% ci: 1.60, 15.70).   conclusions results from this cross-sectional analysis suggest that among female us adolescents, physical activity, but not sedentary behavior, is associated with cardiovascular fitness. among males, the interaction between physical activity and sedentary time seems to be important for cardiovascular fitness. longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm these findings.  background during childhood and adolescence, both physical activity (pa) and sedentary behaviour seem to influence cardiorespiratory fitness (crf); however, the combined association of pa and sedentary behaviour remains to be understood. we analysed the combined association of objectively measured sedentary behaviour and moderate-to-vigorous intensity pa (mvpa) on crf in portuguese children and adolescents. methods the sample comprised 2506 portuguese healthy children and adolescents aged 10–18 years, from a cross-sectional school-based study (2008). pa and sedentary behaviour were assessed with accelerometry. participants were classified as meeting current pa guidelines for youth versus not meeting, and as low versus high sedentary (according to the median value of sedentary time/day by age and gender), and then grouped as follows: low active—high sedentary; low active—low sedentary; high active—high sedentary; high active—low sedentary. crf was assessed with the fitnessgram 20 m shuttle-run test. binary logistic regression models were constructed to verify the relationship between high crf and the combined influence of mvpa/sedentary behaviour, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index and accelerometer wear time. results participants classified as high active/low sedentary (or=1.81; 95% ci 1.21 to 2.69), as well as those classified as low active/low sedentary (or=1.27; 95% ci 1.01 to 1.61) were more likely to be fit, compared with those from the low-active/high-sedentary group. conclusion mvpa and sedentary behaviour may act independently in their relation with crf, and that mvpa levels may not overcome the deleterious influence of high-sedentary time in maximising crf.
elastic network models (enms) are valuable and efficient tools for characterizing the collective internal dynamics of proteins based on the knowledge of their native structures. the increasing evidence that the biological functionality of rnas is often linked to their innate internal motions poses the question of whether enm approaches can be successfully extended to this class of biomolecules. this issue is tackled here by considering various families of elastic networks of increasing complexity applied to a representative set of rnas. the fluctuations predicted by the alternative enms are stringently validated by comparison against extensive molecular dynamics simulations and shape experiments. we find that simulations and experimental data are systematically best reproduced by either an all-atom or a three-beads-per-nucleotide representation (sugar-base-phosphate), with the latter arguably providing the best balance of accuracy and computational complexity.  elastic network models (enms) are a useful tool for describing large scale motions in protein systems. while they are well validated in the context of proteins, relatively little is known about their applicability to nucleic acids, whose different architecture does not necessarily warrant comparable performance. in this study we thoroughly evaluate and optimize the efficiency of popular enms for capturing rna and dna flexibility. we also introduce two alternative models in which the strength of elastic connections at a coarse-grained level is governed by distance distribution at atomic resolution. for each of the considered enms we report the optimal length of spring connections as well as the scaling of elastic force constants that provides the best agreement of vibrational frequencies with normal modes based on atomic force field. in order to determine the absolute values of force constants we introduce a novel method based on the overlap of pseudoinverse of hessian matrices.
we study quantization of a class of inhomogeneous lie bialgebras which are crossproducts in dual sectors with abelian invariant parts. this class forms a category stable under dualization and the double operations. the quantization turns out to be a functor commuting with them. the hopf operations and the universal r-matrices are given in terms of generators. the quantum algebras obtained appear to be isomorphic to the universal enveloping poisson-lie algebras on the dual groups.  a nonlinear change of basis allows us to show that the non-standard quantum deformation of the (3 + 1) poincare algebra has a bicrossproduct structure. quantum universal r-matrix, pauli - lubanski and mass operators are presented in the new basis.
in this study, the antioxidant effect of aminoguanidine on nephrotoxicity of a single dose of cisplatin is investigated and compared with the effects of well-known antioxidants vitamin c and e combination. tubular damage and perivascular inflammation were observed in kidney samples of the cisplatin-administered groups. aminoguanidine and vitamin c-e combination are found to be capable of preventing these effects of cisplatin. liver tissues of all groups were intact. cisplatin-induced oxidative stress was evidenced by significant decrease in glutathione and significant increase in malondialdehyde levels in kidney samples. antioxidants with cisplatin decreased malondialdehyde levels. antioxidants with cisplatin prevented the decrease in liver glutathione levels. the nephrotoxicity was confirmed biochemically by significant elevation of serum urea and creatinine levels. both vitamin c-e combination and aminoguanidine prevented the increase in serum urea levels according to the cisplatin group.  the effect of aminoguanidine (ag) on nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin (cddp) was investigated. a single dose of cddp (7.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced nephrotoxicity, manifested biochemically by a significant elevation in serum urea, creatinine and a severe decrease in serum albumin. moreover, marked increases in kidney weight, urine volume and urinary excretion of albumin were observed. nephrotoxicity was further confirmed by a significant decrease in glutathione-s-transferase (gst, e.c. 2.5.1.18), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px, e.c. 1.11.1.9) and catalase (e.c. 1.11.1.6) and a significant increase in lipid peroxides measured as malondialdhyde (mda) in kidney homogenates. administration of ag (100 mg/kg per day p.o.) in drinking water 5 days before and 5 days after cddp injection produced a significant protection against nephrotoxicity induced by cddp. the amelioration of nephrotoxicity was evidenced by significant reductions in serum urea and creatinine concentrations. in addition, ag tended to normalize decreased levels of serum albumin. urine volume, urinary excretions of albumin and gst and kidney weight were significantly decreased. moreover, ag prevented the rise of mda and the reduction of gst and gsh-px activities in the kidney. these results suggest that ag has a protective effect on nephrotoxicity induced by cddp and it may therefore improve the therapeutic index of cddp.
aims to describe the effects of tolvaptan therapy on dyspnoea relief based on timing of delivery, influence of concomitant therapies, and baseline patient and clinical characteristics. also, the influence of clinical trial design on dyspnoea measurement, from the efficacy of vasopressin antagonism in heart failure outcome study with tolvaptan (everest) trials.   methods and results post hoc analysis was performed based on the endpoint of patient-assessed dyspnoea. changes from baseline at inpatient day 1 were compared between treatment groups by the van elteren test. pre-determined subgroup analyses were also performed. tolvaptan's effects are greatest within 12 h after first dose with an additional, but modest dyspnoea improvement benefit irrespective of time after admission. overall, patients continue to report dyspnoea improvement up to 60 h after admission. the window of enrolment, up to 48 h after admission, combined with measurement on 'day 1' led to a wide range over when dyspnoea was assessed.   conclusion post hoc analysis suggests that tolvaptan modestly improves dyspnoea compared with standard therapy alone, regardless if given early or relatively late after hospitalization, and also across major pre-specified subgroups, despite ongoing background therapy aimed at relieving signs and symptoms. significant variability around when dyspnoea was assessed, in addition to the persistence of dyspnoea despite ongoing background therapy, may influence how future clinical trials assess dyspnoea in acute heart failure syndromes.  context decompensated congestive heart failure (chf) is the leading hospital discharge diagnosis in patients older than 65 years.   objective to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous nesiritide, intravenous nitroglycerin, and placebo.   design, setting, and patients randomized, double-blind trial of 489 inpatients with dyspnea at rest from decompensated chf, including 246 who received pulmonary artery catheterization, that was conducted at 55 community and academic hospitals between october 1999 and july 2000.   interventions intravenous nesiritide (n = 204), intravenous nitroglycerin (n = 143), or placebo (n = 142) added to standard medications for 3 hours, followed by nesiritide (n = 278) or nitroglycerin (n = 216) added to standard medication for 24 hours.   main outcome measures change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (pcwp) among catheterized patients and patient self-evaluation of dyspnea at 3 hours after initiation of study drug among all patients. secondary outcomes included comparisons of hemodynamic and clinical effects between nesiritide and nitroglycerin at 24 hours.   results at 3 hours, the mean (sd) decrease in pcwp from baseline was -5.8 (6.5) mm hg for nesiritide (vs placebo, p<.001; vs nitroglycerin, p =.03), -3.8 (5.3) mm hg for nitroglycerin (vs placebo, p =.09), and -2 (4.2) mm hg for placebo. at 3 hours, nesiritide resulted in improvement in dyspnea compared with placebo (p =.03), but there was no significant difference in dyspnea or global clinical status with nesiritide compared with nitroglycerin. at 24 hours, the reduction in pcwp was greater in the nesiritide group (-8.2 mm hg) than the nitroglycerin group (-6.3 mm hg), but patients reported no significant differences in dyspnea and only modest improvement in global clinical status.   conclusion when added to standard care in patients hospitalized with acutely decompensated chf, nesiritide improves hemodynamic function and some self-reported symptoms more effectively than intravenous nitroglycerin or placebo.
background:identification of men harbouring insignificant prostate cancer (pc) is important in selecting patients for active surveillance. tools have been developed in psa-screened populations to identify such men based on clinical and biopsy parameters.methods:prospectively collected case series of 848 patients was treated with radical prostatectomy between july 2007 and october 2011 at an english tertiary care centre. tumour volume was assessed by pathological examination. for each tool, receiver operator characteristics were calculated for predicting insignificant disease by three different criteria and the area under each curve compared. comparison of accuracy in screened and unscreened populations was performed.results:of 848 patients, 415 had gleason 3+3 disease on biopsy. of these, 32.0% had extra-prostatic extension and 50.2% were upgraded. one had positive lymph nodes. two hundred and six (24% of cohort) were d’amico low risk. of these, 143 had more than two biopsy cores involved. none of the tools evaluated has adequate discriminative power in predicting insignificant tumour burden. accuracy is low in psa-screened and -unscreened populations.conclusions:in our unscreened population, tools designed to identify insignificant pc are inaccurate. detection of a wider size range of prostate tumours in the unscreened may contribute to relative inaccuracy.  purpose we assessed the relationship between the number of positive cores obtained at extended biopsy and tumor volume in radical prostatectomy specimens as a tool for predicting the biological significance of prostate cancer from biopsy data.   materials and methods the study group included 207 men who were treated with radical prostatectomy without neoadjuvant therapy at our cancer center. all patients were diagnosed by systematic extended biopsy (10 or 11 cores) performed between 1997 and 2003. the variables analyzed were patient age, prostate specific antigen, clinical stage, biopsy gleason score, maximum tumor length in a core, greatest percent of tumor in a core, total tumor length, total percent of tumor in all cores, positive core location, initial or repeat biopsy and prostate volume in subgroups based on the number of positive cores, that is group 1-1, group 2-2 and group 3-3 or more cores. bivariate correlation analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to determine the predictors of insignificant cancer.   results the number of positive cores was significantly related to total tumor volume (r = 0.433, p <0.001). insignificant prostate cancer (volume less than 0.5 cc and gleason score 6 or less) was found in 21.7% of patients (45 of 207). the incidence of insignificant cancer was 42.5% (31 of 73 patients) in group 1, 16.4% (10 of 61) in group 2 and 5.5% (4 of 73) in group 3. there was a significant difference in the incidence of insignificant cancer among the subgroups (group 1 vs 2 p <0.001, group 1 vs 3 p <0.0001 and group 2 vs 3 p <0.05). the best model for predicting insignificant cancer in group 1 was the combination of tumor length less than 2 mm, gleason score 3 + 4 or less and prostate volume greater than 50 cc with 83.9% sensitivity (26 of 31 patients) and 61.9% specificity (26 of 42).   conclusions the probability of insignificant cancer was directly related to the number of positive cores. tumor length in a core, gleason score and prostate volume significantly enhanced the prediction model for insignificant cancer in men with 1 positive core who underwent extended biopsy.
malaria is a major public health concern in northeast india with a preponderance of drug-resistant strains. until recently the partner drug for artemisinin combination therapy (act) was sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (sp). antifolate drug resistance has been associated with the mutations at dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) and dihydrofolatereductase (dhfr) genes. this study investigated antifolate drug resistance at the molecular level. a total of 249 fever cases from arunachal pradesh, ne india, were screened for malaria, and of these, 75 were found to be positive for plasmodium falciparum. samples were sequenced and analysed with the help of bioedit and clustalw. three novel point mutations were found in the dhps gene with 10 haplotypes along with the already reported mutations. a single haplotype having quadruple mutation was found in the dhfr gene. the study reports higher degree of antifolate drug resistance as evidenced by the presence of multiple point mutations in dhps and dhfr genes. the findings of this study strongly discourage the use sp as a partner drug in act.  as chloroquine resistance spreads across africa, the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) inhibitors pyrimethamine and proguanil are being used as alternative first-line drugs for the treatment and prevention of plasmodium falciparum malaria. resistance to these drugs is conferred by point mutations in parasite dhfr. these point mutations can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays, but better methods for sample collection, dna extraction, and a diagnostic pcr are needed to make these assays useful in malaria-endemic areas. here we report methods for collecting fingerstick blood onto filter paper strips that are air-dried, then stored and transported at room temperature. cell lysis and dna extraction are accomplished by boiling in chelex-100. we also report a nested pcr technique that has improved sensitivity and specificity. these procedures readily detect mixed infections of parasites with both sensitive and resistant genotypes (confirmed by direct sequencing) and are reliable at parasite densities less than 250/mm3 in field surveys.
relationships are central to human life strategies and have crucial fitness consequences. yet, at the same time, they incur significant maintenance costs that are rarely considered in either social psychological or evolutionary studies. although many social psychological studies have explored their dynamics, these studies have typically focused on a small number of emotionally intense ties, whereas social networks in fact consist of a large number of ties that serve a variety of different functions. in this study, we examined how entire active personal networks changed over 18 months across a major life transition. family relationships and friendships differed strikingly in this respect. the decline in friendship quality was mitigated by increased effort invested in the relationship, but with a striking gender difference: relationship decline was prevented most by increased contact frequency (talking together) for females but by doing more activities together in the case of males.  using a retrospective method, we assessed late adolescents' developmental theories about their affective relationships with their parents. subjects used drawings and questionnaire ratings to portray their relationships with parents at five points between infancy and the present. from infancy to their current age, adolescents portrayed their relationships in two major ways. they perceived themselves as gaining in responsibility, dominance, independence, and similarity from infancy to the present, whereas they portrayed their parents as experiencing a decline on these dimensions. for variables indicating closeness and love, however, there was a striking discontinuity in these linear trends: although adolescents perceived linear trends from infancy to adolescence, they depicted their current relationships as involving a great deal more love and closeness. they also portrayed their relationships with mothers and fathers somewhat differently. more responsibility was felt towards the mothers and they were portrayed as especially friendly, but subjects felt more similar to their fathers, whom they perceived as dominant. we interpreted the results as indicating that late adolescents constructed theories of the affective components of their relationships with their parents to serve the needs of separation while maintaining a close affective tie to the parents.
cd5 is a lymphoid-specific transmembrane glycoprotein constitutively expressed on thymocytes and mature t and b1a lymphocytes. current data support the view that cd5 is a negative regulator of antigen-specific receptor-mediated signaling in these cells, and that this would likely be achieved through interaction with cd5 ligand/s (cd5l) of still undefined nature expressed on immune or accessory cells. to determine the functional consequence of loss of cd5/cd5l interaction in vivo, a new transgenic mouse line was generated (shcd5eμtg), expressing a circulating soluble form of human cd5 (shcd5) as a decoy to impair membrane-bound cd5 function. these shcd5eμtg mice showed an enhanced response to autologous antigens, as deduced from the presentation of more severe forms of experimentally inducible autoimmune disease (collagen-induced arthritis, cia; and experimental autoimmune encephalitis, eae), as well as an increased anti-tumoral response in non-orthotopic cancer models (b16 melanoma). this enhancement of the immune response was in agreement with the finding of significantly reduced proportions of spleen and lymph node treg cells (cd4+cd25+foxp3+), and of peritoneal il-10-producing and cd5+ b cells, as well as an increased proportion of spleen nkt cells in shcd5eμtg mice. similar changes in lymphocyte subpopulations were observed in wild-type mice following repeated administration of exogenous recombinant shcd5 protein. these data reveal the relevant role played by cd5/cd5l interactions on the homeostasis of some functionally relevant lymphocyte subpopulations and the modulation of immune responses to autologous antigens.  cd5 is a 67 kda type i glycoprotein which belongs to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (srcr) family of receptors. this family includes either cell-surface (e.g. cd6) or secreted (e.g. spalpha) proteins implicated in the development of the immune system and the regulation of immune responses. in this study, we purified and characterised a circulating natural soluble cd5 form (nscd5) which is indistinguishable (in apparent molecular mass, glycosylation pattern, and antibody reactivity) from a recombinant soluble cd5 form (rscd5) composed of the three extracellular scrc domains. the nscd5 is a n-glycosylated 52 kda molecule present in normal human serum and in supernatants of in vitro phorbol ester- and cd3-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. the nscd5 concentration in sera from healthy donors is relatively low (median 1.75 ng/ml, rn=166) and is similar to that found in sera from patients suffering of various autoimmune (systemic lupus erythematosus, primary sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis) and non-autoimmune (chronic renal failure, b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia) disorders. in vitro experiments indicate that nscd5 is released by proteolytic cleavage of the membrane form. these results represent the first evidence of proteolytic release of a transmembrane srcr family member following cell activation.
abstract the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria poses a serious threat to human health. bacteria often acquire resistance from a mutation of chromosomal genes during therapy. we have recently shown that the evolution of resistance to ciprofloxacin in vivo and in vitro requires the induction of a mutation that is mediated by the cleavage of the sos repressor lexa and the associated derepression of three specialized dna polymerases (polymerase ii [pol ii], pol iv, and pol v). these results led us to suggest that it may be possible to design drugs to inhibit these proteins and that such drugs might be coadministered with antibiotics to prevent mutation and the evolution of resistance. for the approach to be feasible, there must not be any mechanisms through which bacteria can induce mutations and acquire antibiotic resistance that are independent of lexa and its repressed polymerases. perhaps the most commonly cited mechanism to elevate bacterial mutation rates is the inactivation of methyl-directed mismatch repair (mmr). however, it is unclear whether this represents a lexa-independent mechanism or if the mutations that arise in mmr-deficient hypermutator strains are also dependent on lexa cleavage and polymerase derepression. in this work, we show that lexa cleavage and polymerase derepression are required for the evolution of clinically significant resistance in mmr-defective escherichia coli. thus, drugs that inhibit the proteins responsible for induced mutations are expected to efficiently prevent the evolution of resistance, even in mmr-deficient hypermutator strains.  the incidence of emergent resistance and clinical factors affecting its development were evaluated by retrospective review of 173 studies encompassing over 14,000 patients. eight antibiotic classes and 225 individual treatment regimens were evaluated. emergent resistance occurred among 4.0% of all organisms and 5.6% of all infections treated. it appeared to be significantly more frequent with penicillin and aminoglycoside monotherapy, with significantly lower rates associated with imipenem‐cilastatin, aztreonam, and combination therapy. clinical failure also appeared to be significantly more likely to occur after emergence of resistance among organisms treated with fluoroquinolones or aminoglycosides. infections associated with higher resistance rates were cystic fibrosis, osteomyelitis, and lower respiratory tract infections. resistance was most common in patients in intensive care units or receiving mechanical ventilation. it was also significantly frequent among studies performed in university or teaching hospitals. organisms associated with high resistance rates were pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia, enterobacter, and acinetobacter sp. factors such as infection type, underlying diseases, type of institution, and specific pathogens warrant consideration when examining emergent resistance.
backgroundanxiety and depression can be a long-term strain in cancer survivors. little is known about the emotional situation of cancer survivors who have to deal with work- and family-related issues. the purpose of this study was to investigate anxiety and depression in working-age cancer survivors and associated factors.methodsa register-based sample of 3370 cancer survivors (25 to 55 years at time of diagnosis) diagnosed up to six years prior to the survey was recruited from two german cancer registries. demographic and medical characteristics as well as self-reported measures were used.resultsoverall, approximately 40% of the survivors reported moderate to high anxiety scores and approximately 20% reported moderate to high depression scores. compared to the general population, working-age cancer survivors were more anxious but less depressed (p < .001). subgroups with regard to time since diagnosis did not differ in anxiety or depression. anxiety and depression in cancer survivors were associated with various variables. better social support, family functioning and physical health were associated with lower anxiety and depression.conclusionsoverall, we found higher anxiety levels in cancer survivors of working-age than in the general population. a considerable portion of cancer survivors reported moderate to high levels of anxiety and depression. the results indicate the need for psychosocial screening and psycho-oncological support e.g. in survivorship programs for working-age cancer survivors. assessing the physical health, social support and family background might help to identify survivors at risk for higher emotional distress.  the objective of this study was to explore the psychosocial impact of cancer on newly diagnosed adolescent and young adult (aya) cancer patients.
chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (cr-eae) was induced in lewis rats by inoculation with guinea pig spinal cord and adjuvants and treatment with low dose cyclosporin a (csa). acute eae was induced by the same method without csa treatment. immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry were used to assess inflammatory cells and mhc class ii (ia) antigen expression in the central nervous system of these rats. the inflammatory infiltrate was composed mainly of cd4+ t cells and macrophages, and alpha beta t cells constituted about 65% of the cd2+ t cells. after recovery from acute eae and during the first remission of cr-eae, the number of t cells was significantly less than in the preceding episodes. the number of t cells was higher in the second episode of cr-eae than in the first remission. throughout the course of cr-eae, the majority of the cd2+ t cells were cd45rc-. the ratio of il-2r+ cells to cd2+ cells ranged from 10.5 to 24.0%. the ratio of cd4+ t cells to b cells was lower in the later episodes of cr-eae than in the first episode. ia antigen was expressed on infiltrating round cells at all stages of cr-eae and on microglial cells (identified by dendritic morphology) with increasing intensity throughout the course of cr-eae. with flow cytometry, the number of ia+ cells obtained from the spinal cord rose throughout the course of cr-eae. the number of fsclowox1low cells, which we consider represent microglia, also increased during the course of cr-eae.  in addition to the major population of infiltrating leukocytes recovered from inflamed rat central nervous system (cns), all of which expressed high levels of leukocyte common antigen cd45, many cells were coisolated that were mrc ox42+ (complement receptor 3/cd11b) but expressed low-to-moderate levels of cd45 and major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i molecules. most cells from normal cns, in contrast, lay within this latter, cd45low population. from previous in situ immunohistochemical studies, the fortuitously isolated cd45low cells were probably resident (ramified) microglia. using irradiation chimeras, we show that resident microglia respond to inflammation by upregulating cd45, cd4, and mhc class i molecules with a minority of these cells increasing their expression of mhc class ii molecules. a 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of microglia isolated from inflamed cns provided indirect evidence that the cells had proliferated. in normal cns, a very small population of blood-derived cd45high-expressing cells are present; most mhc class ii expression is associated with these few cells and not with the resident microglia.
in this study we employed the expression of the astrocyte-specific enzyme glutamine synthetase, in addition to the glia-specific marker repo, to characterize glia cell types associated with the embryonic development of the central complex in the grasshopper schistocerca gregaria. double labeling experiments reveal that all glutamine synthetase-positive cells associated with the central complex are also repo-positive and horseradish peroxidase-negative, confirming they are glia. early in embryogenesis, prior to development of the central complex, glia form a continuous population extending from the pars intercerebralis into the region of the commissural fascicles. subsequently, these glia redisperse to envelop each of the modules of the central complex. no glial somata are found within the central complex neuropils themselves. since glutamine synthetase is expressed cortically in glia, it allows their processes as well as their soma locations to be visualized. single cell reconstructions reveal one population of glia as directing extensive ensheathing processes around central complex neuropils such as the central body, while another population projects columnar-like arborizations within the central body. such arborizations are only seen in central complex modules after their neuroarchitecture has been established suggesting that the glial arborizations project onto a prior scaffold of neurons or tracheae.  within the arthropoda, morphologies of neurons, the organization of neurons within neuropils and the occurrence of neuropils can be highly conserved and provide robust characters for phylogenetic analyses. the present paper reviews some features of insect and crustacean brains that speak against an entomostracan origin of the insects, contrary to received opinion. neural organization in brain centres, comprising olfactory pathways, optic lobes and a central neuropil that is thought to play a cardinal role in multi-joint movement, support affinities between insects and malacostracan crustaceans.
the proliferation test with human estrogen receptor-positive mcf-7 breast cancer cells (e-screen assay) was applied for quantitative determination of total estrogenic activity in 24-h composite effluent samples from 16 municipal and two industrial sewage treatment plants (stps) in the state of baden-württemberg, southwestern germany. the estrogenic efficacy relative to the positive control, 17beta-estradiol, was between 26 and 74% (median, 48%) for the 16 municipal stps. estradiol equivalent concentrations (eeqs) were between 0.2 and 7.8 ng/l (median, 1.6 ng/l) and, thereby, were lower than those found in a pilot study, which revealed eeqs of greater than 10 ng/l in the effluents of two other stps. the eeqs in 14 of the 16 effluent samples were very similar (0.9-3.3 ng/l), indicating a rather constant input of estrogenic substances via stps into rivers. additional activated charcoal filtration turned out to be very efficient in further eliminating estrogenic activity from effluents. the eeqs of the e-screen assay and those calculated from the results of extensive chemical analysis using the estradiol equivalency factors determined for 13 natural and synthetic estrogenic substances were comparable for most of the effluent samples. 17beta-estradiol, 17alpha-ethinylestradiol, and, to a lesser extent, estrone contributed to 90% or more of the eeq value.  the cdna of rainbow trout estrogen receptor (rter), highly and stably expressed in yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, was used to analyse the biological activity of the receptor. the rter mrna encoded a 65-kda protein which was immunorevealed by a specific antibody and migrated with the authentic rter major protein form detected in trout liver. yeast rter bound estradiol with high affinity and the dissociation constant (kd = 1.35 nm) was very similar to the value measured from trout liver extracts but 3-5-fold higher than the kd found for human estrogen receptor (her). this indicates therefore that the rter has a lower estradiol affinity compared to the human receptor. while the her kd remained unchanged at both 4 degrees c or 22 degrees c, it was slightly modified at 30 degrees c. the kd measured for rter at 22 degrees c and 30 degrees c were about 2-fold, and 12-fold higher, respectively, than the kd obtained at 4 degrees c suggesting an alteration of the rter affinity for its ligand at elevated temperature. to examine the estrogen-receptor-mediated activation of transcription in yeast, reporter plasmids integrated or not in the yeast genome were used. the reporter genes consist of one, two, or three copies of estrogen-responsive elements (ere) upstream of the yeast proximal cyc1 or ura3 promoters fused to the lacz gene of escherichia coli coding for beta-galactosidase. the induction of beta-galactosidase activity for all reporter genes was strictly dependent on the presence of rter and estrogens. the activation of transcription mediated by rter responded in an estradiol-dose-dependent manner as in animal cells. however, compared to her, the estradiol concentration necessary to achieve maximal activation was 10-fold higher. this is probably a consequence of the lower estradiol-affinity for rter compared to her. the levels of induction of the reporter genes containing two or three ere were strongly enhanced compared to the one ere construct. this is in agreement with the synergistic effect previously described for multiple ere. the magnitudes of transcriptional induction mediated by rter and her were similar when the reporter gene containing three ere was used but changed when the one ere construct was used. in this case transcriptional activation indicated by rter was 10-20 fold lower. this suggests that rter requires protein/protein interaction for its stabilization on dna. antiestrogens were able to bind rter and promote gene transcription. however, to produce effects comparable to those obtained with estrogens, much higher concentrations were required. this may imply nonetheless that antihormones were capable of provoking efficient interactions of rter with the transcriptional machinery.
tp53 is a tumor suppressor gene that functions as transcriptional regulator influencing cellular responses to dna damage. here we explored the clinical and transcriptional effects of tp53 expression in multiple myeloma (mm). we found that low expression of tp53, seen in approximately 10% of newly diagnosed patients, is highly correlated with tp53 deletion, an inferior clinical outcome, and represents an independent risk factor. analysis of the expression of 122 known tp53 target genes in tp53-high vs -low mm cells from 351 newly diagnosed cases, revealed that only a few were highly correlated with tp53 expression. to elucidate tp53 regulatory networks in mm, we overexpressed tp53 in 4 mm cell lines. gene expression profiling of these cell lines detected 85 significantly differentially expressed genes, with 50 up-regulated and 35 down-regulated. unsupervised hierarchical clustering of myeloma samples from 351 newly diagnosed and 90 relapsed patients using the 85 putative tp53 target genes revealed 2 major subgroups showing a strong correlation with tp53 expression and survival. these data suggest that loss of tp53 expression in mm confers high risk and probably results in the deregulation of a novel set of mm-specific tp53-target genes. tp53 target gene specificity may be unique to different cell lineages.  the ability to derive a whole-genome map of transcription-factor binding sites (tfbs) is crucial for elucidating gene regulatory networks. herein, we describe a robust approach that couples chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) with the paired-end ditag (pet) sequencing strategy for unbiased and precise global localization of tfbs. we have applied this strategy to map p53 targets in the human genome. from a saturated sampling of over half a million pet sequences, we characterized 65,572 unique p53 chip dna fragments and established overlapping pet clusters as a readout to define p53 binding loci with remarkable specificity. based on this information, we refined the consensus p53 binding motif, identified at least 542 binding loci with high confidence, discovered 98 previously unidentified p53 target genes that were implicated in novel aspects of p53 functions, and showed their clinical relevance to p53-dependent tumorigenesis in primary cancer samples.
stainless steel embolization coils (ssec) have been used for over four decades for vascular occlusion. recently, the safety of these coils in a magnetic resonance environment has been called into question, with important ramifications for thousands of patients with existing coils in place. we performed a retrospective chart review at five tertiary care pediatric centers evaluating all children and young adults with implanted ssec who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (mri). data reviewed included demographics, coil implantation, mri studies, and follow-up evaluations. complications such as heating, discomfort, or device migration were specifically sought. two hundred and ninety-seven patients with implanted ssec underwent 539 mri examinations. the median age at ssec implantation was 2.3 years (1 week–23.2 years). the mri studies were performed a median of 7.4 years (4 days–23.1 years) after implantation. no patients experienced any reported complications associated with their mri examinations during the study or at median follow-up post-mri of 4.8 years (1 day–23 years). in this large, retrospective review of patients with implanted ssec undergoing mri, there were no reported adverse events. these findings support the recent change by cook medical inc. of their standard embolization coils from a designation of magnetic resonance unsafe to conditional.  to assess the translational and rotational forces acting on a highly ferromagnetic orthopedic spinal implant in 1.5t and 3.0t magnetic resonance (mr) systems.
phase variation of genes in bacteria enables phenotypic alteration to modulate interactions within a host as conditions change. to promote commensalism in animals and disease in humans, campylobacter jejuni produces a flagellar organelle for motility. in addition to tight transcriptional regulation of flagellar genes, c. jejuni also controls flagellar biosynthesis by phase variation. in this study, an unusual phase‐variable mechanism controlling production of flgr, the response regulator of the flgsr two‐component system required for transcription of σ54‐dependent flagellar genes, is identified. phase variation of flgr production is due to loss or gain of a nucleotide in homopolymeric adenine or thymine tracts within flgr. this mechanism occurs during commensalism in poultry to alter the colonization capacity of c. jejuni, presumably by influencing the motility phenotype of the bacterium. these findings provide more understanding into the genetic and colonization strategies c. jejuni employs to achieve commensalism in a natural host. second, due to the richness of the c. jejuni genome in adenine or thymine residues and the apparent lack of the normal set of mismatch repair enzymes, the results from this study may suggest that the c. jejuni genome is more unstable and variable than previously realized. furthermore, phase variation of flagellar motility by targeting flgr may be a phenomenon specific to c. jejuni that is absent in other campylobacter species and contribute to reasons why c. jejuni is more frequently found as a commensal organism in poultry and as the cause of disease in humans.  campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans in developed countries throughout the world. this bacterium frequently promotes a commensal lifestyle in the gastrointestinal tracts of many animals including birds and consumption or handling of poultry meats is a prevalent source of c. jejuni for infection in humans. to understand how the bacterium promotes commensalism, we used signature‐tagged transposon mutagenesis and identified 29 mutants representing 22 different genes of c. jejuni strain 81–176 involved in colonization of the chick gastrointestinal tract. among the determinants identified were two adjacent genes, one encoding a methyl‐accepting chemotaxis protein (mcp), presumably required for proper chemotaxis to a specific environmental component, and another gene encoding a putative cytochrome c peroxidase that may function to reduce periplasmic hydrogen peroxide stress during in vivo growth. deletion of either gene resulted in attenuation for growth throughout the gastrointestinal tract. further examination of 10 other putative mcps or mcp‐domain containing proteins of c. jejuni revealed one other required for wild‐type levels of caecal colonization. this study represents one of the first genetic screens focusing on the bacterial requirements necessary for promoting commensalism in a vertebrate host.
vergence eye movements have traditionally been considered the product of a single neural control center and are usually studied by combining the movements of each eye into a single 'vergence' response. in the present experiment, disparity-driven eye movements were produced by symmetrical step stimuli, and the dynamic properties of each eye movement were analyzed separately. although the final positions of the two eyes were symmetrical, large dynamic asymmetries often occurred. the timing between the two eyes showed fair synchrony as they attained maximum velocity at approximately the same time. since the final static positions were symmetrical, asymmetries occurring during the initial dynamic component must necessarily be compensated by offsetting asymmetries in the latter portion of the response.  experiments are described in which monocular accommodation response/stimulus curves were measured with snellen targets over the stimulus range from +1.0 to -5.0 d, using artificial pupils with diameters of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 mm and a constant retinal illuminance of 600 td. the results agree with those of earlier authors in showing a diminished response with smaller pupils. the slopes of the quasi-linear central portions of the response/stimulus curves are well described in terms of a geometrical optical approximation in which the accommodation system works to produce a retinal blur circle whose diameter is a linear function of the dioptric difference between the magnitudes of the stimulus and the accommodative resting state, this blur circle diameter being independent of the pupil diameter. further consideration of diffractive effects suggests that contrast changes in the intermediate spatial frequency components (approximately 5 c/deg) of the retinal image may play a dominant role in guiding the response.
it has been postulated that the development of amyloid plaques in alzheimer's disease (ad) may result from an imbalance between the generation and clearance of the amyloid-β peptide (aβ). although familial ad appears to be caused by aβ overproduction, sporadic ad (the most prevalent form) may result from impairment in clearance. recent evidence suggests that several proteases may contribute to the degradation of aβ. furthermore, astrocytes have recently been implicated as a potential cellular mediator of aβ degradation. in this study, we examined the possibility that matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), proteases known to be expressed and secreted by astrocytes, could play a role in extracellular aβ degradation. we found that astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques showed enhanced expression of mmp-2 and mmp-9 in aged amyloid precursor protein (app)/presenilin 1 mice. moreover, astrocyte-conditioned medium (acm) degraded aβ, lowering levels and producing several fragments after incubation with synthetic human aβ1–40 and aβ1–42. this activity was attenuated with specific inhibitors of mmp-2 and -9, as well as in acm derived from mmp-2 or -9 knock-out (ko) mice. in vivo, significant increases in the steady-state levels of aβ were found in the brains of mmp-2 and -9 ko mice compared with wild-type controls. furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the mmps with n-[(2r)-2-(hydroxamidocarbonylmethyl)-4-methylpentanoyl]-l-tryptophan methylamide (gm 6001) increased brain interstitial fluid aβ levels and elimination of half-life in appsw mice. these results suggest that mmp-2 and -9 may contribute to extracellular brain aβ clearance by promoting aβ catabolism.  activated macrophages produce several matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), a family of extracellular matrix (ecm)‐degrading enzymes, during wound healing and in other inflammatory states. in response to brain injury, brain microglia become “activated,” in a way similar to peripheral tissue macrophages, a process which includes differentiation and probably invasion and proliferation. little is known about the ecm‐degrading mmps that are secreted by microglia upon activation. thus, it was of interest to determine whether activated microglia secrete mmps. conditioned media samples obtained from cultured microglia that were stimulated with various activating agents were subjected to gelatin‐substrate zymography. microglia constitutively express low levels of a 94‐kda gelatinase (glase) activity. treatment with lps, zymosan, and fixed staphylococcus aureus for 24 hr stimulated the activity of the 94‐kda glase, 4‐20‐fold, in a dose‐dependent manner. addition of infγ inhibited the lps‐stimulated activity of mmp‐9. lps, zymosan, and fixed staphylococcus aureus also stimulated the secretion of il‐6 from microglia in a dose‐dependent manner. the 94‐kda glase activity was ca++ dependent, it was inhibited by 1,10‐phenanthroline, and it was activated by organomercurial compounds. when immunoblots were performed using specific antisera against the 94‐kda gelatinase b (mmp‐9) with untreated and lps‐stimulated conditioned medium samples, a 94‐kda immunopositive band was observed. thus, it appears that the 94‐kda glase is gelatinase b (mmp‐9). these results indicate that activators of peripheral macrophages are potent secretagogues for the mmps in cultured microglia. the ability of activated microglia to secrete mmps suggests that these enzymes may play an important function in the brain parenchyma during inflammatory states. © 1995 wiley‐liss, inc.
objective to understand geographic variations in clinical retention, a central component of the hiv care continuum and key to improving individual- and population-level hiv outcomes. design we evaluated retention by us region in a retrospective observational study. methods adults receiving care from 2000–2010 in 12 clinical cohorts of the north american aids cohort collaboration on research and design (na-accord) contributed data. individuals were assigned to centers for disease control and prevention (cdc)-defined regions by residential data (10 cohorts) and clinic location as proxy (2 cohorts). retention was ≥2 primary hiv outpatient visits within a calendar year, >90 days apart. trends and regional differences were analyzed using modified poisson regression with clustering, adjusting for time in care, age, sex, race/ethnicity, and hiv risk, and stratified by baseline cd4+ count. results among 78,993 adults with 444,212 person-years of follow-up, median time in care was 7 years (interquartile range: 4–9). retention increased from 2000 to 2010: from 73% (5,000/6,875) to 85% (7,189/8,462) in the northeast, 75% (1,778/2,356) to 87% (1,630/1,880) in the midwest, 68% (8,451/12,417) to 80% (9,892/12,304) in the south, and 68% (5,147/7,520) to 72% (6,401/8,895) in the west. in adjusted analyses, retention improved over time in all regions (p<0.01, trend), although the average percent retained lagged in the west and south vs. the northeast (p<0.01). conclusions in our population, retention improved, though regional differences persisted even after adjusting for demographic and hiv risk factors. these data demonstrate regional differences in the us which may affect patient care, despite national care recommendations.  cohort studies based upon clinic populations and medical records are becoming more abundant due in part to an increasing trend toward electronic medical records and advancement in information technology. this design has been utilized in the hiv setting to great success and involves following individuals as they access medical care. these clinical cohort designs have not been compared to the classic interval cohort design in which individuals are followed at specified intervals that are unrelated to the participants' ongoing health care. the interval and clinical cohort designs are distinguished and the advantages and disadvantages inherent in each design are discussed.
as a toy model for the implementation of the diffeomorphism constraint, the interpretation of the resulting states and the treatment of ordering ambiguities in loop quantum gravity, we consider the hilbert space of spatially diffeomorphism-invariant states for a scalar field. we give a very explicit formula for the scalar product on this space and discuss its structure. then we turn to the quantization of a certain class of diffeomorphism-invariant quantities on that space and discuss in detail the ordering issues involved. on a technical level these issues bear some similarity to those encountered in full loop quantum gravity.  in loop quantum gravity, matter fields can have support only on the 'polymer-like' excitations of quantum geometry, and their algebras of observables and hilbert spaces of states cannot refer to a classical, background geometry. therefore, to adequately handle the matter sector, one has to address two issues already at the kinematic level. first, one has to construct the appropriate background-independent operator algebras and hilbert spaces. second, to make contact with low-energy physics, one has to relate this 'polymer description' of matter fields to the standard fock description in minkowski space. while this task has been completed for gauge fields, important gaps remained in the treatment of scalar fields. the purpose of this letter is to fill these gaps.
in this paper, we addressed the named entity recognition (ner) problem for morphologically rich languages by employing a semi-supervised learning approach based on neural networks. we adopted a fast unsupervised method for learning continuous vector representations of words, and used these representations along with language independent features to develop a ner system. we evaluated our system for the highly inflectional turkish and czech languages. we improved the state-of-the-art f-score obtained for turkish without using gazetteers by 2.26% and for czech by 1.53%. unlike the previous state-of-the-art systems developed for these languages, our system does not make use of any language dependent features. therefore, we believe it can easily be applied to other morphologically rich languages.  in this paper, we present our effort to consolidate and push further the named entity recognition (ner) research for the czech language. the research in czech is based upon a non-standard basis. some systems are constructed to provide hierarchical outputs whereas the rests give flat entities. direct comparison among these system is therefore impossible. our first goal is to tackle this issue. we build our own ner system based upon conditional random fields (crf) model. it is constructed to output either flat or hierarchical named entities thus enabling an evaluation with all the known systems for czech language. we show a 3.5 – 11% absolute performance increase when compared to previously published results. as a last step we put our system in the context of the research for other languages. we show results for english, spanish and dutch corpora. we can conclude that our system provides solid results when compared to the foreign state of the art.
it has been demonstrated that there are no sex differences in the oxygen uptake (v̇o2) kinetic response to moderate intensity exercise. however, sex differences in the response to maximal exercise are readily apparent even in the prepubertal years. the purpose of this study was therefore to investigate if sex differences exist in the v̇o2 kinetic response to heavy-intensity exercise. forty-eight prepubertal children (25 male, 23 female) completed four transitions from baseline to 40% of the difference between their previously determined tv-slope (ventilatory threshold determined by the v-slope method) and peak v̇o2 on an electronically braked cycle ergometer. each subject’s breath-by-breath responses were interpolated to 1 s intervals, time aligned and averaged. the data following phase 1 were fit with: (1) a double exponential model and (2) a single exponential model within a fitting window that was previously identified to exclude the slow component. there were no significant differences in the parameters of the primary component between each model. subsequent analysis was carried out using model 2. the primary time constant (τ1) was significantly (p<0.05) faster in boys [17.6 (5.8) s] than girls [21.9 (8.2) s], and the slow component contribution to the total change in amplitude after 9 min was significantly greater in girls [11.8 (5.5)%] than boys [8.9 (3.7)%]. sex differences in the kinetic response to heavy-intensity exercise were identified and suggest that during the prepubertal years, sex differences exist in the ability to deliver and/or utilise oxygen in children.  to determine the precise nonsteady-state characteristics of ventilation (ve), o2 uptake (vo2), and co2 output (vco2) during moderate-intensity exercise, six subjects each underwent eight repetitions of 100-w constant-load cycling. the tests were preceded either by rest or unloaded cycling ("0" w). an early component of ve, vo2, and vco2 responses, which was obscured on any single test by the breath-to-breath fluctuations, became apparent when the several repetitions were averaged. these early responses were abrupt when the work was instituted from rest but were much slower and smaller from the 0-w base line and corresponded to the phase of cardiodynamic gas exchange. some 20 s after the onset of the work a further monoexponential increase to steady state occurred in all three variables, the time constants of which did not differ between the two types of test. consequently, the exponential behavior of ve, vo2, and vco2 in response to moderate exercise is best described by a model that incorporates only the second phase of the response.
artificial vegetation restoration can induce variations in accumulation and distribution of soil carbon (c), nitrogen (n) and phosphorus (p). however, little is known about variations in soil c, n and p nutrient fraction stratification following artificial vegetation in loess plateau china. based on the hypothesis that re-vegetated can improve soil quality and stratification ratios (sr) can be used as an indicator to evaluate soil quality. this study measured contents and storages of soil organic carbon (soc), total nitrogen (tn), total phosphorus (tp) and their srs in topsoil (0–20 cm) and subsoil (20–60 cm) in three 30-year re-vegetated lands that had been converted from arable land (robinia pseudoacacia l., caragana korshinskii kom. and abandoned cropland with low interferences and few management measures) and one slope cropland (sc) as a control for three soil profiles(0–20 cm, 20–40 cm and 40–60 cm) from june 2009 to june 2013. the results showed that the contents and storages of soc, tn and tp in re-vegetated land were significantly higher than those in the sc in both topsoil and subsoil. the storages of soc, tn and tp in the topsoil (0–20 cm) of the re-vegetated lands increased by 16.2%-26.4%, 12.7%-28.4% and 16.5%-20.9%, respectively, and increased by smaller but significant amounts in subsoil from 2009 to 2013. the srs for soc, tn and tp in the re-vegetated lands were mostly >2 (either for 0–20:20–40 cm or 0–20:40–60 cm) and greater than that in the sc. the srs showed an increasing trend with increasing restoration age. the results also showed that the land use type and soil depth were the most influential factors for the srs and storages, and the srs of soc and tn had significantly positive correlations with their storages. the srs were concluded to be a good indicator for evaluating the soil quality, which can be significantly enhanced through vegetation restoration. moreover, vegetation restoration can significantly enhance soc, tn and tp accumulation in both topsoil and subsoil.  as the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon, soils interact strongly with atmospheric composition, climate, and land cover change. our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (soc) and how vegetation change may affect soc distributions with depth. the goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of soc content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths; (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution of soc; and (3) to estimate global soc storage to 3 m, including an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil carbon storage. we based our analysis on .2700 soil profiles in three global databases supplemented with data for climate, vegetation, and land use. the analysis focused on mineral soil layers. plant functional types significantly affected the vertical distribution of soc. the per- centage of soc in the top 20 cm (relative to the first meter) averaged 33%, 42%, and 50% for shrublands, grasslands, and forests, respectively. in shrublands, the amount of soc in the second and third meters was 77% of that in the first meter; in forests and grasslands, the totals were 56% and 43%, respectively. globally, the relative distribution of soc with depth had a slightly stronger association with vegetation than with climate, but the opposite was true for the absolute amount of soc. total soc content increased with precipitation and clay content and decreased with temperature. the importance of these controls switched with depth, climate dominating in shallow layers and clay content dominating in deeper layers, possibly due to increasing percentages of slowly cycling soc fractions at depth. to control for the effects of climate on vegetation, we grouped soils within climatic ranges and compared distributions for vegetation types within each range. the percentage of soc in the top 20 cm relative to the first meter varied from 29% in cold arid shrublands to 57% in cold humid forests and, for a given climate, was always deepest in shrublands, inter- mediate in grasslands, and shallowest in forests ( p , 0.05 in all cases). the effect of vegetation type was more important than the direct effect of precipitation in this analysis. these data suggest that shoot/root allocations combined with vertical root distributions, affect the distribution of soc with depth. global soc storage in the to p3mo fsoil was 2344 pg c, or 56% more than the 1502 pg estimated for the first meter (which is similar to the total soc estimates of 1500-1600 pg made by other researchers). global totals for the second and third meters were 491 and 351 pg c, and the biomes with the most soc at 1-3 m depth were tropical evergreen forests (158 pg c) and tropical grasslands/savannas (146 pg c). our work suggests that plant functional types, through differences in allocation, help to control soc distributions with depth in the soil. our analysis also highlights the potential importance of vegetation change and soc pools for carbon sequestration strategies.
objective identifying the predictors of response to psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatments may be useful for increasing treatment efficacy in pharmacoresistant depressive patients. the goal of this study was to examine the influence of dissociation, hope, personality trait, and selected demographic factors in treatment response of this group of patients. methods pharmacoresistant depressive inpatients were enrolled in the study. all patients completed clinical global impression – both objective and subjective form (cgi), beck depression inventory (bdi), and beck anxiety inventory (bai) at baseline and after 6 weeks of combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy (group cognitive-behavioral or group psychodynamic) treatment as an outcome measures. the internalized stigma of mental illness scale (ismi), dissociative experience scale (des), adult dispositional hope scale (adhs), and temperament and character inventory (tci-r) were completed at the start of the treatment with the intention to find the predictors of treatment efficacy. results the study included 72 patients who were hospitalized for the pharmacoresistant major depression; 63 of them completed the study. the mean scores of bdi-ii, bai, subjcgi, and objcgi significantly decreased during the treatment. bdi-ii relative change statistically significantly correlated with the total ismi score, discrimination experience (ismi subscale), and harm avoidance (tci-r personality trait). according to stepwise regression, the strongest factors connected to bdi-ii relative change were the duration of the disorder and discrimination experience (domain of ismi). objcgi relative change significantly correlated with the level of dissociation (des), the total ismi score, hope in adhs total score, and self-directedness (tci-r). according to stepwise regression, the strongest factor connected to objcgi relative change was discrimination experience (domain of ismi). the existence of comorbid personality disorder did not influence the treatment response. conclusion according to the results of the present study, patients with pharmacoresistant depressive disorders, who have had more experience with discrimination because of their mental struggles, showed a poorer response to treatment.  the purpose of this study was to determine whether cloninger's revised 7-factor model of personality showed incremental validity over his four dimensions of temperament. a sample of 2517 australian twins aged over 50 between 1993 and 1995 returned completed self-reported measures of self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence from cloninger's temperament and character inventory. many of these twins had participated in a 1988 study containing cloninger's temperament measures of harm avoidance, novelty seeking, reward dependence and persistence. contrary to theoretical expectations, univariate analyses revealed that familial aggregation for the character dimensions could be entirely explained by additive gene action alone. although temperament explained 26, 37 and 10% of additive genetic variance in self-directedness, cooperativeness and self-transcendence, respectively, seven genetic factors were required to explain the genetic variance among the tpq dimensions, and almost all of the non-shared environmental variance was unique to each dimension of character. our results indicate that the inclusion of all seven dimensions in a taxonomy of personality is warranted.
the identification of different kinds of multiword expressions require different solutions, on the other hand, there might be domain-related differences in their frequency and typology. in this paper, we show how our methods developed for identifying noun compounds and light verb constructions can be adapted to different domains and different types of texts. our results indicate that with little effort, existing solutions for detecting multiword expressions can be successfully applied to other domains as well.  much work on idioms has focused on type identification, i.e., determining whether a sequence of words can form an idiomatic expression. since an idiom type often has a literal interpretation as well, token classification of potential idioms in context is critical for nlp. we explore the use of informative prior knowledge about the overall syntactic behaviour of a potentially-idiomatic expression (type-based knowledge) to determine whether an instance of the expression is used idiomatically or literally (token-based knowledge). we develop unsupervised methods for the task, and show that their performance is comparable to that of state-of-the-art supervised techniques.
using a new-keynesian model with endogenous capital accumulation, i show that uncertainty about fiscal policy can cause large declines in consumption, investment, and output when the zero lower bound (zlb) binds, but has modest effects when the monetary authority is not constrained by the zlb. i study uncertainty about the level of government spending and uncertainty about tax rates on consumption, wages, capital income, and investment. in my model, uncertainty about government spending and the wage tax rate has particularly large effects. i show that the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty are largest when the nominal interest rate is on the cusp of the zlb and also that delaying fiscal policy uncertainty diminishes its effects only if the resolution of uncertainty occurs after zlb no longer binds.  many commentators argue that uncertainty about taxes, government spending and other policy matters deepened the recession of 2007-2009 and slowed the recovery. to investigate this issue we develop a new index of policy-related economic uncertainty and estimate its dynamic relationship to output, investment and employment. our index averages several components that reflect the frequency of news media references to economic policy uncertainty, the number of federal tax code provisions set to expire in future years, and the extent of forecaster disagreement over future inflation and federal government purchases. the index spikes near consequential presidential elections and after major events such as the gulf wars and the 9/11 attack. index values are very high in recent years with clear jumps around the lehman bankruptcy and tarp legislation, the 2010 midterm elections, the eurozone crisis and the u.s. debt-ceiling dispute. we also construct an index of european economic policy uncertainty mirroring our american news-based index. var estimates show that an increase in policy uncertainty equal to the actual change between 2006 and 2011 foreshadows large and persistent declines in aggregate outcomes, with peak declines of 3.2% in real gdp, 16% in private investment and 2.3 million in aggregate employment. jel no. d80, e22, e66, g18, l50
attentional biases to threat are thought to play a central role in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders. various measures have been developed to index these biases; unfortunately, the psychometric properties of response time measures of attentional bias have not been thoroughly evaluated, and the reliability of those that have been evaluated is poor. the current study assessed the reliability and convergent validity of dot probe and emotional cueing bias scores in high-anxious and low-anxious participants in the context of a state anxiety manipulation to increase the likelihood of producing large, potentially reliable attentional biases. one hundred sixty participants completed an anxious or calm mood induction followed by dot probe and emotional cueing tasks. reliability estimates for bias scores in the full sample were low, ranging from 0 to .44; convergent validity estimates were also poor. the anxiety induction did not substantially improve the reliability or validity of the measures. these results underscore the importance of developing new, more reliable attentional bias measures for future research.  testing feasibility and efficacy of psychological treatment via mobile devices is important, given its potential benefits for high-dosage treatment delivery, widespread and inexpensive dissemination, and efficient research methods. we conducted the first randomized controlled trial of attention bias modification training delivered via smartphones, comparing this training to control training in a double-blind design, also including a waitlist condition. all participants performed a variant of dot-probe training involving faces with neutral and disgust (representative of social threat) expressions in brief sessions three times daily over 4 weeks on their own smartphones, at home or anywhere they chose. attention bias modification, also known as cognitive bias modification of attention, training included a contingency to induce attentional deployment away from disgust faces, whereas the control training included no contingency. participants completed weekly internet-based self-report symptom assessments as well as smartphone-delivered dot-probe attention bias assessments, whose reliability findings supported the viability of using smartphones for reaction-time based assessments. the between-groups training effect on attention bias scores was small, showing statistical significance in some analyses and not in others. on measures of social anxiety, intention-to-treat analyses (n = 326) revealed significant pre–post treatment declines with medium to large effect sizes in both training groups, whereas small declines in a waitlist group were nonsignificant. both training groups showed greater reductions in social anxiety than did waitlist; however, the benefits under these two training conditions were statistically indistinguishable. improvements in the two training conditions beyond those of waitlist could be attributable to any factors common to them, but not to the contingency training specific to active attention bias modification training.
the purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of role-playing teaching as a pedagogical approach for construction management educators in achieving educational objectives. role-playing has been used as a pedagogical approach for many years mostly in sports education, theater, history and other social science disciplines. utilizing the techniques of drama, role-playing teaching is a holistic teaching method that inculcates the process of critical thinking, instigates emotions and moral values, and informs about factual data. the paper presents the results of an experimental study where one group of students was taught using role-playing and the control group was taught using traditional approach. results indicate that students taught using role-playing demonstrated a better understanding about the subject matter and showed more positive attitude towards construction as a profession. based on the results, the paper argues that role-playing teaching meets the needs of construction management educators who are attempting to offer students an active learning environment that balances theory and practice while equipping students with the skills necessary to be successful in the profession.  designing and delivering courses that impart essential learning objectives such as problem solving skills, decision making skills, communication skills, teambuilding, and leadership skills are critical for construction education. considering the complexity of the construction industry, it is of utmost importance to adopt student centered pedagogical strategies for their benefits. one such approach is role-playing teaching that has been successfully implemented in a number of construction programs as well as in various other disciplines. the strategy provides a unique opportunity to the students to assume roles of different project stakeholders and solve real life problems that have been replicated in the classrooms. this paper introduces the concept of role-playing teaching along with the benefits, and also identifies the probable courses in a typical construction program that can be benefitted from the adoption of this pedagogical strategy.
this article describes a pilot youth advocacy initiative for obesity prevention informed by social cognitive theory, social network theory, and theories of community mobilization. with assistance from school and health leaders, adolescent-aged youth led a cafeteria food labeling and social marketing campaign. we implemented an anonymous survey 2 weeks prior to and again at the conclusion of the campaign, and used cafeteria records to track servings of fruits and vegetables. the campaign resulted in a significant increase in youths’ confidence to identify healthy foods (or 1.97, 95 % ci 1.01, 3.84, p = .048), and a significant increase in per person per day servings of fruits (0.02, p = .03) and vegetables (0.01, p = .02). the results of our pilot were promising, and the integration of concepts from multiple theories benefited the implementation process. obesity prevention initiatives should include strategies that encourage youth to create health promotion community networks and lead changes to their social and physical environments.  objectives we assessed the statewide impact of the 2004 texas public school nutrition policy on foods and beverages served or sold in schools.   methods we collected lunch food production records from 47 schools in 11 texas school districts for the school years before (2003-2004) and after (2004-2005) policy implementation. cafeteria servings of fruit, vegetables (regular and fried), and milk served each day were calculated. twenty-three schools from 5 districts provided records of à la carte sales of candy, chips, desserts, drinks, ice cream, and water. we examined aggregated school-level differences in total items served or sold per day per student between study years.   results school demographics were similar to state data. regardless of district and school size, cafeterias served significantly fewer high-fat vegetable items per student postpolicy (p < .001). postpolicy snack bar sales of large bags of chips were significantly reduced (p = .006), and baked chips sales significantly increased (p = .048).   conclusions school food policy changes have improved foods served or sold to students. it is not known whether improved lunch choices influence consumption for the whole day.
statistical effective energy function (seef) is derived from the statistical analysis of the database of known protein structures. dehouck–gilis–rooman (dgr) group has recently created a new generation of seef in which the additivity of the energy terms was manifested by decomposing the total folding free energy into a sum of lower order terms. we have tried to optimize the potential function based on their work. by using decoy datasets as screening filter, and through modification of algorithms in calculation of accessible surface area and residue–residue interaction cutoff, four new combinations of the energy terms were found to be comparable to dgr potential in performance test. most importantly, the term number was reduced from the original 30 terms to only 5 in our results, thereby substantially decreasing the computation time while the performance was not sacrificed. our results further proved the additivity and manipulability of the dgr original energy function, and our new combination of the energy could be used in prediction of protein structures.  we describe predictions made using the rosetta structure prediction methodology for both template‐based modeling and free modeling categories in the seventh critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction. for the first time, aggressive sampling and all‐atom refinement could be carried out for the majority of targets, an advance enabled by the rosetta@home distributed computing network. template‐based modeling predictions using an iterative refinement algorithm improved over the best existing templates for the majority of proteins with less than 200 residues. free modeling methods gave near‐atomic accuracy predictions for several targets under 100 residues from all secondary structure classes. these results indicate that refinement with an all‐atom energy function, although computationally expensive, is a powerful method for obtaining accurate structure predictions. proteins 2007. © 2007 wiley‐liss, inc.
an important and widely recognized condition of the maned wolf is cystinuria, or excess levels of cystine in the urine. cystinuria has been identified in the majority of maned wolves tested, both in captivity and in the wild. cystinuria also occurs in humans and domestic dogs, and has been demonstrated in these species to have a genetic basis. in all species afflicted with this condition clinical disease may occur secondary to urolith formation. the solubility of cystine in urine is ph-dependent and the unusually low urine ph of many captive maned wolves may predispose them to morbidity and mortality related to cystine urolithiasis. dietary modification is a significant component of cystinuria management in both human and canine patients. based on present knowledge, we hypothesize that through dietary modifications we can reduce urinary cystine concentrations as well as produce alterations in urinary ph which increase cystine solubility and decrease cystine urolith formation in captive maned wolves.  this study was designed to characterize the effect of urinary sodium excretion on amino acid excretion in cystinuria. we studied three homozygous patients with cystinuria at various levels of sodium intake ranging between 50 and 230 mmol/day. a reduction in sodium intake produced a marked decrease in rates of urinary cysteine excretion. the low-sodium diet also reduced the excretion of lysine but had no significant effect on the excretion of ornithine or arginine. we conclude that a dietary restriction of sodium may reduce the urinary excretion of cystine and can provide a simple and safe long-term approach to the treatment of cystinuria.
tissue regeneration alternatives for peripheral vascular disease are actively being investigated; however, few studies in this area have probed the role of the wound healing monocyte-derived macrophage (mdm). inflammatory mdms transition to wound healing mdms as the relative levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) decrease and il-10 increase. tnf-alpha has been linked to the regulation of hmgb1 (high mobility group box 1 protein), a nuclear protein that upon macrophage stimulation can be secreted and act as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. this study investigated the influence of a degradable polar hydrophobic ionic polyurethane (d-phi) on mdm cell expression of pro- versus anti-inflammatory markers, when the material was uncoated or pre-coated with collagen prior to cell studies. effects were compared to similar groups on tissue culture polystyrene (tcps). collagen coated tcps and d-phi had significantly more dna than the uncoated tcps after 7d (p=0.001 and p=0.006 respectively); however, there was significantly less esterase activity from cells on d-phi (+/-collagen) than for cells on tcps after 7d (p=0.002, p=0.0003 respectively). no significant differences in esterase activity were observed between collagen coated and non-coated d-phi surfaces. analyses of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tnf-alpha, il-1beta and hmgb1) secreted from differentiating monocytes adherent to d-phi demonstrated a decrease whereas anti-inflammatory il-10 increased over time when compared to tcps, suggesting that d-phi was less inflammatory than tcps. since d-phi maintains cell attachment while aiding in the transition of mdm to a wound healing phenotype, this material has qualities suitable to be used in tissue engineering applications where mdm play a key role in tissue regeneration.  a biodegradable lysine diisocyanate-based poly(glycolide-co-epsilon-caprolactone)urethane network has been evaluated as a material for the construction of a macroporous bottom layer (dermal analogue) in a two-layer artificial skin. high rates of in vitro degradation were observed; degradation of the porous poly(glycolide-co-epsilon-caprolactone)urethane networks was faster in vivo than in vitro. subcutaneous implantation in guinea pigs showed that the porous polyurethane networks allowed rapid cell ingrowth, degraded almost completely 4-8 wk after implantation and evoked no adverse tissue reaction.
as different parts of a protein chain approach one another during folding, they are expected to encounter desolvation barriers before optimal packing is achieved. this impediment originates from the water molecule's finite size, which entails a net energetic cost for water exclusion when the formation of compensating close intraprotein contacts is not yet complete. based on recent advances, we extend our exploration of these microscopic elementary desolvation barriers' roles in the emergence of generic properties of protein folding. using continuum gō-like c(alpha) chain models of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (ci2) and barnase as examples, we underscore that elementary desolvation barriers between a protein's constituent groups can significantly reduce native conformational fluctuations relative to model predictions that neglected these barriers. an increasing height of elementary desolvation barriers leads to thermodynamically more cooperative folding/unfolding transitions (i.e., higher overall empirical folding barriers) and higher degrees of kinetic cooperativity as manifested by more linear rate-stability relationships under constant temperature. applying a spatially non-uniform thermodynamic parametrization we recently introduced for the pairwise c(alpha) potentials of mean force, the present barnase model further illustrates that desolvation is a probable physical underpinning for the experimentally observed high intrinsic enthalpic folding barrier under isostability conditions.  experimental data from global analyses of temperature (t) and denaturant dependence of the folding rates of small proteins led to an intrinsic enthalpic folding barrier hypothesis: to a good approximation, the t-dependence of folding rate under constant native stability conditions is arrhenius. furthermore, for a given protein, the slope of isostability folding rate versus 1/t is essentially independent of native stability. this hypothesis implies a simple relationship between chevron and eyring plots of folding that is easily discernible when both sets of rates are expressed as functions of native stability. using experimental data in the literature, we verify the predicted chevron-eyring relationship for 14 proteins and determine their intrinsic enthalpic folding barriers, which vary approximately from 15 kcal/mol to 40 kcal/mol for different proteins. these enthalpic barriers do not appear to correlate with folding rates, but they exhibit correlation with equilibrium unfolding enthalpy at room temperature. intrinsic enthalpic barriers with similarly high magnitudes apply as well to at least two cases of peptide-peptide and peptide-protein association, suggesting that these barriers are a hallmark of certain general and fundamental kinetic processes during folding and binding. using a class of explicit-chain c(alpha) protein models with constant elementary enthalpic desolvation barriers between c(alpha) positions, we show that small microscopic pairwise desolvation barriers, which are a direct consequence of the particulate nature of water, can act cooperatively to give rise to a significant overall enthalpic barrier to folding. this theoretical finding provides a physical rationalization for the high intrinsic enthalpic barriers in protein folding energetics. ramifications of entropy-enthalpy compensation in hydrophobic association for the height of enthalpic desolvation barrier are discussed.
prolotherapy involves the injection of nonbiologic solutions, typically at soft tissue attachments and within joint spaces, to reduce pain and improve function in painful musculoskeletal conditions. a variety of solutions have been used; dextrose prolotherapy is the most rigorously studied and is the focus of this review. although the mechanism of action is not clearly known, it is likely to be multifactorial. data on effectiveness for temporomandibular dysfunction are promising but insufficient for recommendations. research on the mechanism of action and clinical effects of dextrose prolotherapy are under way.  flaws in the design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of randomised trials can cause the effect of an intervention to be underestimated or overestimated. the cochrane collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias aims to make the process clearer and more accurate
we introduce a multi-distance, frequency-domain, near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) method to measure the optical coefficients of two-layered media and the thickness of the top layer from diffuse reflectance measurements. this method features a direct solution based on diffusion theory and an inversion procedure based on the levenberg-marquardt algorithm. we have validated our method through monte carlo simulations, experiments on tissue-like phantoms, and measurements on the forehead of three human subjects. the monte carlo simulations and phantom measurements have shown that, in ideal two-layered samples, our method accurately recovers the top layer thickness (l), the absorption coefficient (µa) and the reduced scattering coefficient (µ′s) of both layers with deviations that are typically less than 10% for all parameters. our method is aimed at absolute measurements of hemoglobin concentration and saturation in cerebral and extracerebral tissue of adult human subjects, where the top layer (layer 1) represents extracerebral tissue (scalp, skull, dura mater, subarachnoid space, etc.) and the bottom layer (layer 2) represents cerebral tissue. human subject measurements have shown a significantly greater total hemoglobin concentration in cerebral tissue (82±14 µm) with respect to extracerebral tissue (30±7 µm). by contrast, there was no significant difference between the hemoglobin saturation measured in cerebral tissue (56%±10%) and extracerebral tissue (62%±6%). to our knowledge, this is the first time that an inversion procedure in the frequency domain with six unknown parameters with no other prior knowledge is used for the retrieval of the optical coefficients and top layer thickness with high accuracy on two-layered media. our absolute measurements of cerebral hemoglobin concentration and saturation are based on the discrimination of extracerebral and cerebral tissue layers, and they can enhance the impact of nirs for cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation assessment both in the research arena and clinical practice.  we present near-infrared spectroscopy measurement of absolute cerebral hemoglobin concentration and saturation in a large sample of 36 healthy elderly (mean age, 85 ± 6 years) and 19 young adults (mean age, 28 ± 4 years). non-invasive measurements were obtained on the forehead using a commercially available multi-distance frequency-domain system and analyzed using a diffusion theory model for a semi-infinite, homogeneous medium with semi-infinite boundary conditions. our study included repeat measurements, taken five months apart, on 16 elderly volunteers that demonstrate intra-subject reproducibility of the absolute measurements with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.9 for absorption coefficient (μa), oxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hbo2]), and total hemoglobin concentration ([hbt]), 0.7 for deoxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hb]), 0.8 for hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sto2), and 0.7 for reduced scattering coefficient (μ's). we found significant differences between the two age groups. compared to young subjects, elderly subjects had lower cerebral [hbo2], [hb], [hbt], and sto2 by 10 ± 4 μm, 4 ± 3 μm, 14 ± 5 μm, and 6%±5%, respectively. our results demonstrate the reliability and robustness of multi-distance near-infrared spectroscopy measurements based on a homogeneous model in the human forehead on a large sample of human subjects. absolute, non-invasive optical measurements on the brain, such as those presented here, can significantly advance the development of nirs technology as a tool for monitoring resting/basal cerebral perfusion, hemodynamics, oxygenation, and metabolism.
a noninvasive screening test would significantly facilitate early detection of epithelial ovarian cancer. this study used a combination of high-throughput selection and array-based serologic detection of many antigens indicative of the presence of cancer, thereby using the immune system as a biosensor. this high-throughput selection involved biopanning of an ovarian cancer phage display library using serum immunoglobulins from an ovarian cancer patient as bait. protein macroarrays containing 480 of these selected antigen clones revealed 65 clones that interacted with immunoglobulins in sera from 32 ovarian cancer patients but not with sera from 25 healthy women or 14 patients having other benign or malignant gynecologic diseases. sequence analysis data of these 65 clones revealed 62 different antigens. among the markers, we identified some known antigens, including rcas1, signal recognition protein-19, ahnak-related sequence, nuclear autoantogenic sperm protein, nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (nibrin), ribosomal protein l4, homo sapiens kiaa0419 gene product, eukaryotic initiation factor 5a, and casein kinase ii, as well as many previously uncharacterized antigenic gene products. using these 65 antigens on protein microarrays, we trained neural networks on two-color fluorescent detection of serum igg binding and found an average sensitivity and specificity of 55% and 98%, respectively. in addition, the top 6 of the most specific clones resulted in an average sensitivity and specificity of 32% and 94%, respectively. this global approach to antigenic profiling, epitomics, has applications to cancer and autoimmune diseases for diagnostic and therapeutic studies. further work with larger panels of antigens should provide a comprehensive set of markers with sufficient sensitivity and specificity suitable for clinical testing in high-risk populations.  the her-2/neu protooncogene is amplified and overexpressed in 20-40% of invasive breast cancers. her-2/neu protein overexpression is associated with aggressive disease and is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in several subsets of patients. the protein may also be related to cancer formation, with overexpression being detectable in 50-60% of ductal carcinomas in situ. it has been suggested that it might be possible to develop specific t-cell therapy directed against proteins involved in malignant transformation. one question is whether normal proteins that are overexpressed are appropriate targets for therapeutic immune attack. this report demonstrates that some patients with her-2/neu-positive breast cancers have both existent cd4+ helper/inducer t-cell immunity and antibody-mediated immunity to her-2/neu protein. initial studies performed on 20 premenopausal breast cancer patients identified antibodies to her-2/neu in 11 individuals. similar antibody responses have been found in some normal individuals. the patient with the greatest antibody response was studied in detail. in addition to a humoral immune response this patient had evidence of a significant proliferative t-cell response to the her-2/neu protein and peptides. similar t-cell responses have been detected in additional patients. it has been assumed that patients would be immunologically tolerant to her-2/neu as a self-protein and that immunity might be difficult to generate. if immunity could be generated, the result might be destructive autoimmunity. the current data support the notion that her-2/neu-specific immunity might be used in therapy without destroying normal tissue but also raises questions as to the role of existent immunity in immune surveillance and cancer progression.
recent studies have revealed the physiological significance of post-translational lysine acylations such as acetylation in the regulation of various cellular processes. here, we characterized lysine propionylation, a recently discovered post-translational acylation, in five representative bacteria: geobacillus kaustophilus, thermus thermophilus, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, and rhodothermus marinus. using antibody-based propionyl peptide enrichment followed by identification with nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that proteins were subject to lysine propionylation in all five bacterial species analyzed. notably, many propionylations were identified in the bacillus-related, thermophilic eubacterium g. kaustophilus, but fewer in the mesophilic eubacterium b. subtilis, suggesting that propionylation event abundance is independent of phylogenetic relationship. we further found propionylation sites in the thermophilic eubacterium t. thermophilus, but the thermophilic eubacterium r. marinus showed the fewest number of sites, indicating that growth temperature is not a determinant of propionylation state. in silico analyses demonstrated that lysine propionylation is related to metabolic pathways, particularly those controlled by acyl-coa synthetases, similar to lysine acetylation. we also detected dozens of propionylation sites at positions important for protein functions across bacteria, demonstrating the regulatory mechanisms affected by lysine propionylations. our proteome-wide analyses across bacteria thus provide insights into the general functions of lysine propionylation.  recent studies of protein post-translational modifications revealed that various types of lysine acylation occur in eukaryotic and bacterial proteins. lysine propionylation, a newly discovered type of acylation, occurs in several proteins, including some histones. in this study, we identified 361 propionylation sites in 183 mid-exponential phase and late stationary phase proteins from thermus thermophilus hb8, an extremely thermophilic eubacterium. functional classification of the propionylproteins revealed that the number of propionylation sites in metabolic enzymes increased in late stationary phase, irrespective of protein abundance. the propionylation sites on proteins expressed in mid-exponential and late stationary phases partially overlapped. furthermore, amino acid frequencies in the vicinity of propionylation sites differed, not only between the two growth phases but also relative to acetylation sites. in addition, 33.8% of mid-exponential phase–specific and 80.0% of late stationary phase–specific propionylations (n ≥ 2) implied that specific mechanisms regulate propionylation in the cell. moreover, the limited degree of overlap between lysine propionylation (36.8%) and acetylation (49.2%) sites in 67 proteins that were both acetylated and propionylated strongly suggested that the two acylation reactions are regulated separately by specific enzymes and may serve different functions. finally, we also found that eight propionylation sites overlapped with acetylation sites critical for protein functions such as schiff-base formation and ligand binding.
overexpression of the ped/pea-15 protein in muscle and adipose cells increases glucose transport and impairs further insulin induction. like glucose transport, protein kinase c (pkc)-a and -b are also constitutively activated and are not further stimulatable by insulin in l6 skeletal muscle cells overexpressing ped (l6ped). pkc-z features no basal change but completely loses insulin sensitivity in l6ped. in these cells, blockage of pkc-a and -b additively returns 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2dg) uptake to the levels of cells expressing only endogenous ped (l6wt). blockage of pkc-a and -b also restores insulin activation of pkc-z in l6ped cells, with that of pkc-a sixfold more effective than pkc-b. similar effects on 2-dg uptake and pkc-z were also achieved by 50-fold overexpression of pkc-z in l6ped. in l6wt, fivefold overexpression of pkc-a or -b increases basal 2-dg uptake and impairs further insulin induction with no effect on insulin receptor or insulin receptor substrate phosphorylation. in these cells, overexpression of pkc-a blocks insulin induction of pkc-z activity. pkc-b is 10-fold less effective than pkc-a in inhibiting pkc-z stimulation. expression of the dominant-negative k3w pkc-z mutant simultaneously inhibits insulin activation of pkc-z and 2-dg uptake in the l6wt cells. we conclude that activation of classic pkcs, mainly pkc-a, inhibits pkc-z and may mediate the action of ped on glucose uptake in l6 skeletal muscle cells. diabetes 50:1244–1252, 2001  we have used differential display to identify genes whose expression is altered in type 2 diabetes thus contributing to its pathogenesis. one mrna is overexpressed in fibroblasts from type 2 diabetics compared with non‐diabetic individuals, as well as in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues, two major sites of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. the levels of the protein encoded by this mrna are also elevated in type 2 diabetic tissues; thus, we named it ped for phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes. ped cloning shows that it encodes a 15 kda phosphoprotein identical to the protein kinase c (pkc) substrate pea‐15. the ped gene maps on human chromosome 1q21–22. transfection of ped/pea‐15 in differentiating l6 skeletal muscle cells increases the content of glut1 transporters on the plasma membrane and inhibits insulin‐stimulated glucose transport and cell‐surface recruitment of glut4, the major insulin‐sensitive glucose transporter. these effects of ped overexpression are reversed by blocking pkc activity. overexpression of the ped/pea‐15 gene may contribute to insulin resistance in glucose uptake in type 2 diabetes.
using a new-keynesian model with endogenous capital accumulation, i show that uncertainty about fiscal policy can cause large declines in consumption, investment, and output when the zero lower bound (zlb) binds, but has modest effects when the monetary authority is not constrained by the zlb. i study uncertainty about the level of government spending and uncertainty about tax rates on consumption, wages, capital income, and investment. in my model, uncertainty about government spending and the wage tax rate has particularly large effects. i show that the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty are largest when the nominal interest rate is on the cusp of the zlb and also that delaying fiscal policy uncertainty diminishes its effects only if the resolution of uncertainty occurs after zlb no longer binds.  many commentators argue that uncertainty about taxes, government spending and other policy matters deepened the recession of 2007-2009 and slowed the recovery. to investigate this issue we develop a new index of policy-related economic uncertainty and estimate its dynamic relationship to output, investment and employment. our index averages several components that reflect the frequency of news media references to economic policy uncertainty, the number of federal tax code provisions set to expire in future years, and the extent of forecaster disagreement over future inflation and federal government purchases. the index spikes near consequential presidential elections and after major events such as the gulf wars and the 9/11 attack. index values are very high in recent years with clear jumps around the lehman bankruptcy and tarp legislation, the 2010 midterm elections, the eurozone crisis and the u.s. debt-ceiling dispute. we also construct an index of european economic policy uncertainty mirroring our american news-based index. var estimates show that an increase in policy uncertainty equal to the actual change between 2006 and 2011 foreshadows large and persistent declines in aggregate outcomes, with peak declines of 3.2% in real gdp, 16% in private investment and 2.3 million in aggregate employment. jel no. d80, e22, e66, g18, l50
how best to efficiently establish correspondence among a large set of images or video frames is an interesting unanswered question. for large databases, the high computational cost of performing pair-wise image matching is a major problem. however, for many applications, images are inherently sparsely connected, and so current techniques try to correctly estimate small potentially matching subsets of databases upon which to perform expensive pair-wise matching. our contribution is to pose the identification of potential matches as a link prediction problem in an image correspondence graph, and to propose an effective algorithm to solve this problem. our algorithm facilitates incremental image matching: initially, the match graph is very sparse, but it becomes dense as we alternate between link prediction and verification. we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it with several existing alternatives on large-scale databases. our resulting match graph is useful for many different applications. as an example, we show the benefits of our graph construction method to a label propagation application which propagates user-provided sparse object labels to other instances of that object in large image collections.  the widespread availability of digital cameras and ubiquitous internet access have facilitated the creation of massive image collections. these collections can be highly interconnected through implicit links between image pairs viewing the same or similar objects. we propose building graphs called image webs to represent such connections. while earlier efforts studied local neighborhoods of such graphs, we are interested in understanding global structure and exploiting connectivity at larger scales. we show how to efficiently construct image webs that capture the connectivity in an image collection using spectral graph theory. our technique can link together tens of thousands of images in a few minutes using a computer cluster. we also demonstrate applications for exploring collections based on global topological analysis.
the research field of indoor navigation focuses on the position estimate in gnss-shaded (global navigation satellite system) areas. accelerometer and gyroscope as micro electro mechanical systems are used for a position estimate based on pedestrian dead reckoning, where the accelerometer is used for step detection. to realize a usefull position estimate for pedestrian navigation, the distance accuracy of the step length has to be less than a few centimeters to reach this accuracy, because the distance errors add up themselves time-dependent. this step length is derived from the sensor data of the integrated accelerometer of the smartphone. in this article, a step counter with step length estimate based on a artificial neural network (ann) is described. the matlab toolbox neural network is used to generate the structure of ann. after leveling the three axis accelerometer the z-axis acceleration will be used to realize a ann based on data from more than forty persons. besides that, the results will be compared to an alternative approach, while two conditions are used which successively must be fulfilled. the results of this investigation reveal a step recognition rate of 99.5% as well as an average distance error of 9% of the respective distance.  global navigation satellite systems (gnss)-based navigation with smartphones is very popular. but in areas where no gnss signal is found navigation could be useful. examples are navigation in shopping malls, in big offices, in train stations or museums. the goal is to estimate the position in gnss shaded areas to make navigation possible. the mems sensors (micro electro mechanical system) installed in current smartphones, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetic field sensor and barometer allow now navigation also in gnss shadowed areas. due to the low quality of these sensors, however, support of the position estimate is needed. in this work, a concept is presented for the construction of an indoor navigation system based on low-cost sensors of smartphones. the position estimate from the available sensor data forms the basis of the position determination. so position estimation is always possible independent of location. first results with kalman filter and particle filter are shown. the presented concept serves as a basis for the construction of a smartphone-based navigation solution for indoor use. therefore the available mems sensors should be used as a position estimator and a wide variety of supporting information can be processed. a first approach for implementation on a smartphone is shown as an example.
in response to a variety of environmental cues, prokaryotes can switch between a motile and a sessile, biofilm‐forming mode of growth. the regulatory mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying this switch are largely unknown in archaea but involve small winged helix‐turn‐helix dna‐binding proteins of the archaea‐specific lrs14 family. here, we study the lrs14 member abfr1 of sulfolobus acidocaldarius. small‐angle x‐ray scattering data are presented, which are consistent with a model of dimeric abfr1 in which dimerization occurs via an antiparallel coiled coil as suggested by homology modeling. furthermore, solution structure data of abfr1‐dna complexes suggest that upon binding dna, abfr1 induces deformations in the dna. the wing residues tyrosine 84 and serine 87, which are phosphorylated in vivo, are crucial to establish stable protein‐dna contacts and their substitution with a negatively charged glutamate or aspartate residue inhibits formation of a nucleoprotein complex. furthermore, mutation abrogates the cellular abundance and transcription regulatory function of abfr1 and thus affects the resulting biofilm and motility phenotype of s. acidocaldarius. this work establishes a novel whth dna‐binding mode for lrs14‐like proteins and hints at an important role for protein phosphorylation as a signal transduction mechanism for the control of biofilm formation and motility in archaea.  in this study, the in vitro and in vivo functions of the only two identified protein phosphatases, saci-ptp and saci-pp2a, in the crenarchaeal model organism sulfolobus acidocaldarius were investigated. biochemical characterization revealed that saci-ptp is a dual-specific phosphatase (against pser/pthr and ptyr), whereas saci-pp2a exhibited specific pser/pthr activity and inhibition by okadaic acid. deletion of saci_pp2a resulted in pronounced alterations in growth, cell shape and cell size, which could be partially complemented. transcriptome analysis of the three strains (δsaci_ptp, δsaci_pp2a and the mw001 parental strain) revealed 155 genes that were differentially expressed in the deletion mutants, and showed significant changes in expression of genes encoding the archaella (archaeal motility structure), components of the respiratory chain and transcriptional regulators. phosphoproteome studies revealed 801 unique phosphoproteins in total, with an increase in identified phosphopeptides in the deletion mutants. proteins from most functional categories were affected by phosphorylation, including components of the motility system, the respiratory chain, and regulatory proteins. in the saci_pp2a deletion mutant the up-regulation at the transcript level, as well as the observed phosphorylation pattern, resembled starvation stress responses. hypermotility was also observed in the saci_pp2a deletion mutant. the results highlight the importance of protein phosphorylation in regulating essential cellular processes in the crenarchaeon s. acidocaldarius.
we report a significant negative correlation between nonsynonymous polymorphism and intron length in drosophila melanogaster. this correlation is similar to that between protein divergence and intron length previously reported in drosophila. we show that the relationship can be explained by the content of conserved noncoding sequences (cns) within introns. in addition, genes with a high regulatory complexity and many genetic interactions also exhibit larger amounts of cns within their introns and lower values of nonsynonymous polymorphism. the present study provides relevant evidence on the importance of intron content and expression patterns on the levels of coding polymorphism.  synonymous codons are not used equally in many organisms, and the extent of codon bias varies among loci. earlier studies have suggested that more highly expressed loci in drosophila melanogaster are more biased, consistent with findings from several prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes that codon bias is partly due to natural selection for translational efficiency. we link this model of varying selection intensity to the population-genetics prediction that the effectiveness of natural selection is decreased under reduced recombination. in analyses of 385 d. melanogaster loci, we find that codon bias is reduced in regions of low recombination (i.e., near centromeres and telomeres and on the fourth chromosome). the effect does not appear to be a linear function of recombination rate; rather, it seems limited to regions with the very lowest levels of recombination. the large majority of the genome apparently experiences recombination at a sufficiently high rate for effective natural selection against suboptimal codons. these findings support models of the hill-robertson effect and genetic hitchhiking and are largely consistent with multiple reports of low levels of dna sequence variation in regions of low recombination.
stem cells are required to support the indeterminate growth style of plants. meristems are a plants stem cell niches that foster stem cell survival and the production of descendants destined for differentiation. in shoot meristems, stem cell fate is decided at the populational level. the size of the stem cell domain at the meristem tip depends on signals that are exchanged with cells of the organizing centre underneath. in root meristems, individual stem cells are controlled by direct interaction with cells of the quiescent centre that lie in the immediate neighbourhood. analysis of the interactions and signaling processes in the stem cell niches has delivered some insights into the molecules that are involved and revealed that the two major niches for plant stem cells are more similar than anticipated.  four classes of floral homeotic mads domain proteins specify the identities of the four organ types in an arabidopsis flower. while the activities of the mads domain proteins are essentially confined to the flower or to the inflorescence, several genes, such as apetala2, hua1 and hua2, also act outside the flower in addition to their organ identity functions inside the flower. we identified a new gene, hua enhancer 1 (hen1) from a sensitized genetic screen in the hua1-1 hua2-1 background that is compromised in floral homeotic c function. we showed that hen1, like the c function gene agamous, acts to specify reproductive organ identities and to repress a function. hen1 also shares ag's non-homeotic function in controlling floral determinacy. hen1 may achieve these functions by regulating the expression of ag. hen1 single mutants exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes such as reduced organ size, altered rosette leaf shape and increased number of coflorescences, during most stages of development. therefore, hen1, like the a function gene ap2, plays multiple roles in plant development as well as acting in organ identity specification in the flower. hen1 codes for a novel protein and is expressed throughout the plant.
our aim was to clarify the role of alcohol and other drug (aod) use in major depression among gay men attending general medical practices. a secondary analysis was conducted on survey data collected from 531 gay men attending high-hiv-caseload general practices in adelaide and sydney, australia. the survey contained demographic, social, behavioural and aod variables. participants were classified into those with (n = 130) and without major depression (n = 401) using the phq-9 screening tool. although rates of drug use were very high in the sample, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the majority of variables independently associated with major depression were social and behavioural factors. only one aod variable was associated with major depression: the use of three or more drug types in the past 6 months. attending to specific patterns of aod use may assist in the identification of gay men most at risk of major depression.  objectives : social factors associated with major depressive disorder (mdd) were identified among gay men attending high hiv caseload general practices in sydney and adelaide.
effect of various voltage of electrical stimulation (es) on meat quality of lamb and goat was investigated by using a total of 36 animals at 3–5 years old. constant 50 hz frequency and 50, 100, and 250 v, 90 sec of es were administered to 1/2 carcasses and were examined according their textural, physicochemical, and sensorial characteristics. es decreased the ph values of lamb and goat meat, and accelerated the rigor mortis (p < 0.05). additionally, es enhanced the water activity, water-holding capacity, and drip loss of both animals. shear force varied between lamb and goat meat, and tenderness was improved depending on voltage range used (p < 0.001). es caused difference in instrumental colour (cie l ∗, a ∗, b ∗) values of lamb and goat meat compared with the control groups (p < 0.05) during aging period at 4°c. sensorial characteristics were also improved with various levels of es treatments. in conclusion, es had positive effects on meat quality of lamb and goat, in contrast to undesirable consumer preferences.  our study examined high and low voltage electrical stimulation and postmortem storage as strategies to improve tenderness and lean color in cabrito carcasses. boer cross (n=60) kids were assigned to either high (550 v), low (20 v), or no electrical stimulation treatments. no differences in muscle temperature were observed between treatments at any time measured. muscle ph declined fastest in high voltage treated carcasses. high voltage electrical stimulation slightly increased (p<0.05) b (∗) and a (∗) in the m. gluteus medius and tended to increase l (∗) and b (∗) (p=0.06 and 0.11, respectively) values in the m. longissimus thoracis. electrical stimulation had no effect on myofibril fragmentation at 1-, 3-, or 14-d postmortem or sarcomere length. high voltage electrical stimulation increased (p<0.05) tenderness at 1- and 3-d postmortem, but not at 14-d postmortem. aging for 3 d did not affect tenderness regardless of stimulation treatment, but aging time for 14 d improved (p<0.05) tenderness. these data indicate that high voltage electrical stimulation and 14 d aging were effective in improving the tenderness of meat from cabrito carcasses.
during the first week posthatch, the avian immune system is immature and inefficient at protecting chicks from invading pathogens. among immunomodulators, beta-glucans are known as biological response modifiers due to their ability to activate the immune system. current research suggests that beta-glucans may enhance avian immunity; however, very little is known about their influence on regulation of immune function. a study was performed to evaluate the effects of dietary beta-glucan on growth performance, immune organ weights, peripheral blood cell profiles, and immune-related gene expression in the intestine. one-day-old chicks were fed a diet containing 0, 0.02, or 0.1% yeast beta-glucan (n = 30/treatment). on d 7 and 14 posthatch, body and relative immune organ weights were measured and small intestinal sections were collected to evaluate gene expression by quantitative real-time pcr. peripheral blood samples were also collected to determine heterophil:lymphocyte ratios. supplementation of beta-glucan did not significantly affect bw gains, and no significant differences were observed among groups for relative immune organ weights or heterophil:lymphocyte ratios. compared with controls, expression of interleukin (il)-8 was downregulated in the beta-glucan-treated groups on d 7 and 14. on d 14, beta-glucan inclusion resulted in increased inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. expression of il-18 was upregulated on d 7 but reduced on d 14 due to beta-glucan supplementation. on d 7, interferon-gamma and il-4 expression decreased in the beta-glucan-treated groups. however, on d 14, il-4 expression was upregulated in the supplemented groups. intestinal expression of il-13 was also downregulated in the beta-glucan-treated birds on d 7. these results suggest that dietary inclusion of beta-glucans altered the cytokine-chemokine balance; however, it did not elicit a robust immune response in the absence of a challenge, resulting in no deleterious effects on performance.  β-glucan, one of the major cell wall components of saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been found to enhance immune functions. this study investigated in vivo and in vitro effects of β-glucan on lymphoproliferation and interferonγ (ifn-γ) production by splenic cells from c57bl/6 female mice. all experiments were performed with particulate βglucan derived from s. cerevisiae. data demonstrated that both, i.p administration of particulate β-glucan (20 or 100 μg/animal) and in vitro stimulation of splenic cells (20 or 100 μg/ml of culture) decreased lymphoproliferation and ifn-γ production induced by concanavalin a. these results suggest that β-glucan can trigger a down-modulatory effect regulating a deleterious immune system hyperactivity in the presence of a strong stimulus.
digital platforms in healthcare institutions enable tracking and recording of patient care pathways. besides the electronic health records (ehrs), the event logs from hospital information systems (his) are a very efficient source of information, from both operational and clinical point of view. process mining allows comparison of a patient care pathway with the event log(s) from his, to understand how well the reality as depicted in the event log fits the expectation as modeled using a care pathway. in this paper, we present sepvis, a visual analytics tool which aims to fill the gap in current process-centric applications by looking at patients' pathways from a clinical point of view. we demonstrate the utility of sepvis in selected use cases derived by the guidelines in the management of sepsis patients.  under the umbrella of buzzwords such as “business activity monitoring” (bam) and “business process intelligence” (bpi) both academic (e.g., emit, little thumb, inwolve, process miner, and minson) and commercial tools (e.g., aris ppm, hp bpi, and ilog jviews) have been developed. the goal of these tools is to extract knowledge from event logs (e.g., transaction logs in an erp system or audit trails in a wfm system), i.e., to do process mining. unfortunately, tools use different formats for reading/storing log files and present their results in different ways. this makes it difficult to use different tools on the same data set and to compare the mining results. furthermore, some of these tools implement concepts that can be very useful in the other tools but it is often difficult to combine tools. as a result, researchers working on new process mining techniques are forced to build a mining infrastructure from scratch or test their techniques in an isolated way, disconnected from any practical applications. to overcome these kind of problems, we have developed the prom framework, i.e., an “pluggable” environment for process mining. the framework is flexible with respect to the input and output format, and is also open enough to allow for the easy reuse of code during the implementation of new process mining ideas. this paper introduces the prom framework and gives an overview of the plug-ins that have been developed.
objective the purpose of this study was to assess the risks and complications of ct-guided needle biopsy of lung nodules in patients with a single lung after pneumonectomy.   materials and methods a database search for the records of patients who had undergone lung biopsy over a 9-year period revealed that 1771 patients had done so. fourteen (0.7%) of these patients (11 men, three women; mean age, 63 years; range, 42.4-79.6 years) had undergone pneumonectomy and been referred for biopsy of the contralateral lung. the images and medical records of these patients were reviewed in detail.   results lung biopsy was technically successful in 86% (12/14) of cases. all procedures were fine-needle aspiration, and a core biopsy specimen also was obtained in one case. fifty percent (6/12) of the procedures were performed with local anesthesia alone and 50% with a combination of local anesthesia and conscious sedation. the pneumothorax rate was 25% (3/12). all pneumothoraces were small and asymptomatic, and none required a chest drain. there were no cases of hemoptysis. no other immediate or delayed complications were encountered. malignancy was found in 83% (10/12) of cases. in one of the other two cases (8%) the result was false-negative, and in the other, the nodules resolved without chemotherapy and were presumed to be inflammatory.   conclusion percutaneous lung biopsy performed on the single lung in patients who have undergone pneumonectomy is feasible and successful. lung biopsy in these circumstances should be performed by an experienced radiologist with thoracic surgical backup.  2division of abdominal imaging and interventional radiology, massachusetts general hospital, boston, ma. case history a 75-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with an acute myocardial infarction. the patient was a former heavy smoker. a chest radiograph revealed a left apical lung mass (fig. 1). a ct scan showed a cavitary left upper lobe lung mass measuring 3.5 × 4 cm (fig. 2a) with an additional 3 × 2 cm mass at the left hilum (fig. 2b). a wholebody pet scan showed the left upper lobe mass and at the left hilum, increased 18f-fdg uptake that was suggestive of lung neoplasm metastatic to the left hilum (fig. 3). therefore, a thoracic radiologist was consulted for biopsy of the left upper lobe lung mass. dr. titton. it is interesting to note that a pet scan was obtained for this patient. what is the role of 18f-fdg pet in the evaluation of patients with a pulmonary nodule or lung cancer? dr. kalra. in the evaluation of patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule, 18f-fdg pet improves characterization of the nodule by estimating the probability of malignancy. the high positive predictive value for malignancy in nodules greater than 1 cm in diameter suggests that those with positive scan results should undergo either percutaneous biopsy or surgical resection. histologic examination of pet-positive lesions is necessary because false-positive pet findings can be encountered with granulomatous lesions secondary to sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or infection [1]. false-negative pet findings are seen in patients with small lesions (< 1 cm) and in selected malignancies, such as bronchioalveolar cell carcinoma or well-differentiated adenocarcinoma or carcinoid tumor. for this reason, regardless of pet findings,
significance mesoscale convective systems (mcss) are the primary source of precipitation over the tropics and midlatitudes, and their lifetime can have a large influence on the variability of rainfall, especially extreme rainfall that causes flooding. the hypothesis that aerosols can increase the lifetime of the mcss by weakening or delaying precipitation has long been proposed, but we have not known whether that increase is significant on global and regional scales, and, if so, how it compares with the influence of meteorological conditions. we use multiyear collocated geostationary and polar-orbital satellite datasets to provide, to our knowledge, the first observational assessment of such an aerosol effect and its relative importance compared with other meteorological conditions in determining the variability of mcss’ lifetime. using collocated measurements from geostationary and polar-orbital satellites over tropical continents, we provide a large-scale statistical assessment of the relative influence of aerosols and meteorological conditions on the lifetime of mesoscale convective systems (mcss). our results show that mcss’ lifetime increases by 3–24 h when vertical wind shear (vws) and convective available potential energy (cape) are moderate to high and ambient aerosol optical depth (aod) increases by 1 sd (1σ). however, this influence is not as strong as that of cape, relative humidity, and vws, which increase mcss’ lifetime by 3–30 h, 3–27 h, and 3–30 h per 1σ of these variables and explain up to 36%, 45%, and 34%, respectively, of the variance of the mcss’ lifetime. aod explains up to 24% of the total variance of mcss’ lifetime during the decay phase. this result is physically consistent with that of the variation of the mcss’ ice water content (iwc) with aerosols, which accounts for 35% and 27% of the total variance of the iwc in convective cores and anvil, respectively, during the decay phase. the effect of aerosols on mcss’ lifetime varies between different continents. aod appears to explain up to 20–22% of the total variance of mcss’ lifetime over equatorial south america compared with 8% over equatorial africa. aerosols over the indian ocean can explain 20% of total variance of mcss’ lifetime over south asia because such mcss form and develop over the ocean. these regional differences of aerosol impacts may be linked to different meteorological conditions.  we estimate the extent of upper tropospheric aerosol layers (ut als) surrounding mesoscale convective systems (mcss) and explore the relationships between ut al extent and the morphology, location, and developmental stage of collocated mcss in the tropics. our analysis is based on satellite data collected over equatorial africa, south asia, and the amazon basin between june 2006 and june 2008. we identify substantial variations in the relationships between convective properties and aerosol transport by region and stage of convective development. the most extensive ut als over equatorial africa are associated with mature mcss, while the most extensive ut als over south asia and the amazon are associated with growing mcss. convective aerosol transport over the amazon is weaker than that observed over the other two regions despite similar transport frequencies, likely due to the smaller sizes and shorter mean lifetimes of mcss over the amazon. variations in ut als in the vicinity of tropical mcss are primarily explained by variations in the horizontal sizes of the associated mcss and are largely unrelated to aerosol loading in the lower troposphere. we also identify potentially important relationships with the number of convective cores, vertical wind shear, and convective fraction during the growing and mature stages of mcs development. relationships between convective properties and aerosol transport are relatively weak during the decaying stage of convective development. our results provide an interpretive framework for devising and evaluating numerical model experiments that examine relationships between convective properties and als in the upper troposphere.
an infrasonic observatory collocated with the colorado state university chill radar during the summer of 1995 permitted unique comparisons between severe storm kinematics and detected acoustic energy at subaudible frequencies near 1 hz. radar observations of a velocity couplet aloft (evolving into a tornado) showed a circulation maximum descending for about 30 min while moving to the east. the detected infrasound followed the trend of these observations. a model of sound radiated from vortex systems predicts frequencies in the range observed. these data are interpreted in the context of past infrasonic observations. an ongoing study comparing regional tornado and funnel sightings with archived infrasonic data has identified over 100 cases to date where the infrasonic signals occurred at the time of, and from the direction of, the vortices. for some of these cases, the distances were greater than 100 km. the author and his associates continue to collect datasets to permit further evaluation of infrasonic detection methods.  abstract this paper attempts to explain the “whining” or “hissing” sound reported from tornadoes. the leading hypothesis is that the air masses involved in the tornado circulation execute some free vibrations. it is found that these vibrations may be in the audible range for a small vortex whose radius is of the order of 10 m. or less. a formula is obtained which relates the frequency of the tone to the inner radius of the vortex. this formula is amenable to experimental verification.
we consider the online matching problem, where \(n\) server-vertices lie in a metric space and \(n\) request-vertices that arrive over time each must immediately be permanently assigned to a server-vertex. we focus on the egalitarian bottleneck objective, where the goal is to minimize the maximum distance between any request and its server. it has been demonstrated that while there are effective algorithms for the utilitarian objective (minimizing total cost) in the resource augmentation setting where the offline adversary has half the resources, these are not effective for the egalitarian objective. thus, we propose a new serve-or-skip bicriteria analysis model, where the online algorithm may reject or skip up to a specified number of requests, and propose two greedy algorithms: grinn \((t)\) and grin* \((t)\). we show that the serve-or-skip model of resource augmentation analysis can essentially simulate the doubled-server-capacity model, and then characterize the performance of grinn \((t)\) and grin* \((t)\).  given a set s ⊆ r of points on the line, we consider the task of matching a sequence (r1, r1,... ) of requests in r to points in s. it has been conjectured [online algorithms: the state of the art, lecture notes in computer science, vol. 1442, springer, berlin, 1998, pp. 268-280] that there exists a 9-competitive online algorithm for this problem, similar to the so-called "cow path" problem [inform. and comput. 106 (1993) 234-252]. we disprove this conjecture and show that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio strictly less than 9.001.our argument is based on a new proof for the optimality of the competitive ratio 9 for the "cow path" problem.
aniline exposure is associated with toxicity to the spleen leading to splenomegaly, hyperplasia, fibrosis and a variety of sarcomas of the spleen on chronic exposure. in earlier studies, we have shown that aniline exposure leads to iron overload, oxidative stress and activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors, which could regulate various genes leading to a tumorigenic response in the spleen. however, molecular mechanisms leading to aniline-induced cellular proliferation in the spleen remain largely unknown. this study was, therefore, undertaken on the regulation of g1 phase cell cycle proteins (cyclins), expression of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (prb) and cell proliferation in the spleen, in an experimental condition preceding a tumorigenic response. male sd rats were treated with aniline (0.5 mmol/kg/day via drinking water) for 30 days (controls received drinking water only), and splenocyte proliferation, protein expression of g1 phase cyclins, cdks and prb were measured. aniline treatment resulted in significant increases in splenocyte proliferation, based on cell counts, cell proliferation markers including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna), nuclear ki67 protein (ki67) and minichromosome maintenance (mcm), mtt assay and flow cytometric analysis. western blot analysis of splenocyte proteins from aniline-treated rats showed significantly increased expression of cyclins d1, d2, d3 and e, as compared to the controls. similarly, real-time pcr analysis showed significantly increased mrna expression for cyclins d1, d2, d3 and e in the spleens of aniline-treated rats. the overexpression of these cyclins was associated with increases in the expression of cdk4, cdk6, cdk2 as well as phosphorylation of prb protein. our data suggest that increased expression of cyclins, cdks and phosphorylation of prb protein could be critical in cell proliferation, and may contribute to aniline-induced tumorigenic response in the spleen.  cell cycle progression and cell division are driven by the sequential activation of a group of serine-threonine kinases called cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). multiple cdks control the cell cycle in mammals and have been long considered essential for normal proliferation, development and homeostasis. the importance of the cdk-cyclin complexes in cell proliferation is underscored by the fact that deregulation of the cdk activity is found in virtually the whole spectrum of human tumors. advances in the cell cycle proteins in the last 25 years, since the discovery of cyclins, have been discussed and have shed even more light on this essential life sustaining process. recent information from different models for the various cyclins and cdks have made some of the generally accepted concepts of cell cycle regulation to be revised and new and exciting questions to be investigated. there is also increasing evidence that suggests that cdks such as cdc2 are also commonly targeted by viral proteins, which modulate host cell cycle machinery to benefit viral survival or replication. this review, describes some of the most recent and important us patents related to cell cycle regulation and those on viral proteins involved in cell cycle modulation particularly the g2/m phase transition and cancer therapy.
feral swine were targeted for control at avon park air force range in south-central florida to avert damage to sensitive wetland habitats on the 40,000-ha base. we conducted a 5-year study to assess impacts from control to this population that had been recreationally hunted for many years. control was initiated in early 2009. the feral swine population was monitored from 2008 to 2012 using a passive tracking index (pti) during the dry and wet seasons and using recreational hunter take rates from the dry season. all three indices showed substantial feral swine declines after implementing control, with indices leveling for the final two study years. military missions and recreational hunting seasons impacted temporal and spatial consistency of control application, thereby limiting further impacts of control efforts on the feral swine population. the pti was also able to monitor coyotes, another invasive species on the base, and detect florida black bear and florida panther, species of particular concern.  summaryin the last decades, wild boar (sus scrofa) distribution has increased world-wide, the iberian peninsula being no exception. the wild boar now inhabits almost the entire iberian territory, where today it is one of the most important big game species. in this paper, for the first time, bag analysis from two ecological different regions are presented and compared to the employed hunting techniques. one represents the well-preserved mediterranean forests of south-western spain, the other, located in the south of portugal, is a farmland with interspersed forest areas. our results indicate a stronger hunting intensity and also a higher wild boar population density in the portuguese study areas. the stronger hunting intensity may result in a younger wild boar population. we also found considerable differences between the shooting techniques used in both regions and those employed in the north-east of the peninsula. it does therefore not seem advisable to directly compare bag statistics from different regions of the iberian peninsula.zusammenfassungin den letzten jahrzehnten hat das wildschwein (sus scrofa) sein vebreitungsgebiet weltweit ausgedehnt. die iberische halbinsel bildet diesbezüglich keine ausnahme. das wildschwein kommt dort gegenwärtig nahezu überall vor und stellt eine der wichtigsten gro\wildarten dar. in dieser arbeit werden erstmals streckenanalysen aus zwei ökologisch unterschiedlichen regionen der iberischen halbinsel vorgelegt und im hinblick auf die eingesetzten jagdmethoden verglichen. eine region repräsentiert die gut erhaltenen mediterranen wälder südwest-spaniens. die andere, im süden portugals gelegene untersuchungsregion ist ein agrargebiet mit eingestreuten wäldern. unsere ergebnisse weisen auf einen höheren jagddruck sowie eine grö\ere populationsdichte der wildschweine im portugiesischen untersuchungsgebiet hin. der grö\ere jagddruck kann ursache für ein im mittel geringeres alter der dortigen wildschwein-population sein. es wurden ferner beachtliche unterschiede in den bejagungsmethoden zwischen den beiden untersuchungsgebieten und dem nordosten iberiens beobachtet. wegen dieser unterschiede erscheint ein direkter vergleich von streckenergebnissen aus verschiedenen regionen der iberischen halbinsel nicht ratsam.résuméau cours des dernières décennies, la distribution mondiale du sanglier (sus scrofa) a fortement augmenté, la péninsule ibérique ne faisant pas exception à cet égard. le sanglier colonise pratiquement l'entièreté du territoire ibérique où il représente aujourd'hui une des espèces-gibier les plus importantes. dans cette contribution, pour la première fois, l'analyse des tableaux de tir réalisés dans deux régions écologiquement différentes est présentée et rapportée aux techniques cynégétiques utilisées. l'une correspond aux forêts méditerranéennes bien conservées du sud-ouest de l'espagne, l'autre, située au sud du portugal, est constituée d'une alternance de terres agricoles et de forêts. nos résultats indiquent une pression cynégétique plus intense de même qu'une densité de population en sangliers plus élevée dans la partie portugaise de l'aire d'étude. la pression cynégétique plus forte peut donner lieu à une population de sangliers plus jeune. nous avons également constaté des différences considérables entre les techniques de tir utilisées dans les deux régions et celles utilisées dans le nord-est de la péninsule. il ne semble dès lors pas recommandable de comparer directement les statistiques de tir de différentes régions de la péninsule ibérique.
+1 weeks gestational age. the patient was diagnosed to be acute appendicitis and underwent laparoscopic surgery. however, an inflamed solitary cecal diverticulum was found during surgery. after a routine appendectomy, cecal diverticulitis was conservatively treated with postoperative antibiotics without signs of peritonitis. to date, most of the non-pregnant women with cecal diverticulitis have been managed surgically. our case indicates that a pregnant patient with cecal diverticulitis could be managed medically during pregnancy.  diverticula are herniations through the colonic wall and are therefore likely to be due to a weakness within the wall, an alteration in intracolonic pressures or a combination of these factors. this article reviews these aspects in relation to the pathogenesis of colonic diverticula.
we analyse changes in plant cover and species richness along a 60-year chronosequence in semi-arid mediterranean old-fields of southeastern spain. the objectives were: (i) to study patterns of species richness along the abandonment gradient in semi-arid conditions (e.g., to test the “humped-back model” in our system); (ii) to test whether different broad life forms (annuals, forbs, grasses and woody species) showed different patterns along the abandonment gradient, and (iii) to examine to what extent plants with different dispersal strategies dominate at different stages of succession. the explained variance of the regression relating species richness to years since abandonment is improved when considering different life forms. the results suggest that cover and richness of different functional groups show a non-linear unimodal (often positive-skewed) pattern along the gradient (age since abandonment). maximum total richness is found at young stages of abandonment (<20 years), when most life forms and dispersal strategies coexist. annuals and perennial forbs reached their maximum richness during the first 10 years of abandonment. about 45% of total woody species richness is reached at this time as a consequence of early colonization of zoochorous shrubs. while the results showed a tendency towards a life-form replacement sequence, the pattern is not so clear when looking at the different dispersal strategies. the results complement previous results in mediterranean conditions and emphasise the importance of considering different functional types when studying successional patterns.  plant species diversity patterns of the rocky mountain forests were found to be at variance with patterns reported from other regions. the most centrally located forests in terms of elevation, site moisture and successional status were found to have the lowest diversity. in contrast, the peripheral and environmentally more severe sites were found to have relatively high diversity. in particular, the forest-grassland transition and the low elevation riparian forests have species diversity values as high as any yet reported from western north america. when diversity was examined in terms of variation across elevation or moisture gradients, varying results were obtained due to the interaction of these factors. the failure of previous studies to converge on generalizations about plant diversity reflects, in part, the failure of most investigators to view diversity in a regional context of variation across several interacting gradients. diversity was seen to vary inversely with the degree of development of the forest canopy. the interaction of different components of the forest community is one reason for the failure of general patterns of plant species diversity to emerge from previous studies. a potentially rich herb community can be greatly suppressed by a single species tree stratum. among the most successful work to date on species diversity is that on birds, a distinct albeit large and functional group. it is unlikely that similar success could have been achieved through work on all animal species simultaneously. this suggests the need to examine plant species diversity, not in terms of total diversity, but in terms of component functional groups, perhaps guilds, growing under similar microclimatic conditions and subject to similar competitive pressures.
pollination and fertilization trigger unique developmental programs leading to embryogenesis, ovary maturation and seed set. pistil tissues are actively involved in pollen tube growth and respond to the presence of the growing pollen tubes by modulating the expression of specific genes. using subtractive hybridization to isolate genes involved in pollen-pistil interactions and fertilization, we have isolated a pollination- and fertilization-induced dioxygenase which is predominantly expressed in the pistil. in situ hybridization analyses revealed that the spp2 dioxygenase (solanum pollinated pistil) from the self-incompatible wild potato solanum chacoense bitt. is also developmentally regulated, with mrna levels gradually regressing from the tip of the style towards the ovary during pistil development. at maturity, the upper limit of spp2 transcript distribution coincided with the abscission zone of the style and spp2 dioxygenase expression in ovaries coincided with the fertilization receptivity period of the flower. pollination, as well as wounding of the style, induced an increase in spp2 mrna steady-state levels at a distance, in the ovary. treatments with stress hormones including methyl jasmonate, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid mimicked the wound response and also induced spp2 transcripts in the ovary. the spp2 dioxygenase could be involved in the biosynthesis of deterrent alkaloids in reproductive tissues or in generating chemical signals involved in pollen tube guidance.  a heterologous cdna probe from petunia hybrida was used to isolate flavanone-3 beta-hydroxylase-encoding cdna clones from carnation (dianthus caryophyllus), china aster (callistephus chinensis) and stock (matthiola incana). the deduced protein sequences together with the known sequences of the enzyme from p. hybrida, barley (hordeum vulgare) and snapdragon (antirrhinum majus) enabled the determination of a consensus sequence which revealed an overall 84% similarity (53% identity) of flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylases from the different sources. alignment with the sequences of other known enzymes of the same class and to related non-heme iron-(ii) enzymes demonstrated the strict genetic conservation of 14 amino acids, in particular, of three histidines and an aspartic acid. the conservation of the histidine motifs provides strong support for the possible conservation of structurally similar iron-binding sites in these enzymes. the putative role of histidines as chelators of ferrous ions in the active site of flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylases was corroborated by diethyl-pyrocarbonate modification of the partially purified recombinant petunia enzyme.
this paper presents the notion of obstruction degree, a new metric for reasoning about the scalability of concurrent algorithms. essentially, this simple metric gives an indication as to which of two concurrent algorithms is expected to scale better, as well as approximate the maximum number of processors up to which a concurrent algorithm is expected to scale. the scope of the metric is the arguably large class of concurrent algorithms obtained by augmenting sequential algorithms with locks (pessimistic), invalidation primitives (optimistic) or transactional memory. we illustrate the metric through various algorithms and we convey the accuracy of our scalability predictions through extensive experimental measures.  we propose obstruction-free step complexity, a new complexity measure for nonblocking algorithms. we believe that this measure provides a more pragmatic quanti.cation of nonblocking algorithms than previous measures, providing better guidance for designers of practical nonblocking algorithms.    in our opinion, the main shortcoming of existing complexity measures for nonblocking algorithms is that they are targeted towardsworst-case behavior inworstcase scenarios, and say little about behavior inmore common cases.this is true for the sensitivity measure of attiya and dagan [1], and the d-local step complexity of afek et al. [2]. these measures are directed at evaluating the behavior of algorithms under contention, i.e., when concurrent operations actively interfere with each other’s progress. however, in practice, a well-designed system manages contention so that it does not impact performance too greatly. thus, these previous measures do not evaluate the behaviour that is likely to be observed.
previous research on gaze behaviour in sport has typically reported summary fixation statistics thereby largely ignoring the temporal sequencing of gaze. in the present study on penalty kicking in soccer, our aim was to apply a markov chain modelling method to eye movement data obtained from goalkeepers. building on the discrete analysis of gaze employed by dicks et al. (atten percept psychophys 72(3):706–720, 2010b), we wanted to statistically model the relative probabilities of the goalkeeper’s gaze being directed to different locations throughout the penalty taker’s approach (dicks et al. in atten percept psychophys 72(3):706–720, 2010b). examination of gaze behaviours under in situ and video-simulation task constraints reveals differences in information pickup for perception and action (attention, perception and psychophysics 72(3), 706–720). the probabilities of fixating anatomical locations of the penalty taker were high under simulated movement response conditions. in contrast, when actually required to intercept kicks, the goalkeepers initially favoured watching the penalty taker’s head but then rapidly shifted focus directly to the ball for approximately the final second prior to foot-ball contact. the increased spatio-temporal demands of in situ interceptive actions over laboratory-based simulated actions lead to different visual search strategies being used. when eye movement data are modelled as time series, it is possible to discern subtle but important behavioural characteristics that are less apparent with discrete summary statistics alone.  it is still not known what underlies successful performance in goaltending. some studies have reported that advanced cues from the shooter's body (hip, kicking leg or support leg) are most important (savelsbergh, g. j. p., williams, a. m., van der kamp, j., & ward, p. (2002). visual search, anticipation and expertise in soccer goalkeepers. journal of sports sciences, 20, 279-287; savelsbergh, g. j. p., williams, a. m., van der kamp, j., & ward, p. (2005). anticipation and visual search behaviour in expert soccer goalkeepers. ergonomics, 48, 1686-1697; williams, a. m., & burwitz, l. (1993). advanced cue utilization in soccer. in t. reilly, j. clarys, & a. stibbe (eds.), science and football ii (pp. 239-243). london, england: e&fn spon), while others have found that the early tracking of the object prior to and during flight is most critical (bard, c., & fleury, m. (1981). considering eye movement as a predictor of attainment. in: i. m. cockerill, & w. m. macgillvary (eds.), vision and sport (pp. 28-41). cheltenham, england: stanley thornes (publishers) ltd.). these results are similar to those found in a number of interceptive timing studies (land, m. f., & mcleod, p. (2000). from eye movements to actions: how batsmen hit the ball. nature neuroscience, 3, 1340-1345; ripoll and fleurance, 1988; vickers, j. n., & adolphe, r. m. (1997). gaze behaviour during a ball tracking and aiming skill. international journal of sports vision, 4, 18-27). the coupled gaze and motor behavior of elite goaltenders were determined while responding to wrist shots taken from 5 m and 10 m on ice. the results showed that the goalies faced shots that were significantly different in phase durations due to distance (5 versus 10 m), but this was not a factor in making saves. instead, the ability to stop the puck was dependent on the location, onset and duration of the final fixation/tracking gaze (or quiet eye) prior to initiating the saving action. the relative onset of quiet eye was significantly (p<.001) earlier (8.6%) and the duration was longer on saves (m=80.5%; 952.3 ms) compared to goals (onset 18.86%; m=70.1%, 826.1 ms). the quiet eye was located on the puck/stick during the preparation and execution of the shot in 70.53% of all trials, or on the ice in front of the release point of the puck (25.68%) and rarely on the body of the shooter (2.1%). the results are discussed within the context of current research on goaltending with specific emphasis on the timing of critical cues and the effect of tasks constraints.
anxiety and depression disorders represent common, serious and growing health problems world-wide. the neurobiological basis of anxiety and depression, however, remains poorly understood. further, there is a clear need for the development of better treatments for these disorders. emerging data with genetic and pharmacological tools supports a role for gabab receptors in both anxiety and depression. gabab receptors are metabotropic gaba receptors that are comprised of two subunits, gabab1 and gabab2, which form heterodimers. the gabab(1) gene is transcribed into two predominate isoforms, gabab(1a) and gabab(1b) which differ in sequence primarily by the inclusion of a pair of sushi domains (or short consensus repeats) in the gabab(1a) n-terminus. both isoforms heterodimerize with gabab2 subunits to form functional receptors. the two gabab(1) isoforms and the gabab(2) subunit constitute the majority of the molecular diversity of the gabab receptor. however, in the absence of any isoform-selective ligands for research, the behavioural function of mammalian gabab1 receptor isoforms has been inscrutable. recently mice deficient in gabab(1a) and gabab(1b) isoforms were generated. aspects of anxiety- and depression-related behaviour may be modelled in mice, by using traditional animal models, and by examining specific biological and behavioural components of the human symptomatology, or ‘endophenotypes’. a preliminary aim of this thesis was to determine the utility of gabab(1) isoform-deficient mice for the dissection of gabab(1a) and gabab(1b) isoform-mediated behaviour. the main aim of this thesis was to test the hypothesis, using a combination of traditional and endophenotype murine models, that gabab(1) receptor isoforms play an important role in the mediation and anxiety and depression-related behaviour.      gabab(1) isoforms in gabab receptor function:  preparatory work in this thesis examined the influence of genetic background on gabab receptor-mediated responses. genetic background, in the form of different mouse strains, had a strong, differential effect on the classic responses to gabab receptor activation; hypothermia and ataxia. this underlined the necessity of including multiple experimental endpoints in the examination of gabab receptor function in subsequent work with gabab(1) isoform-deficient mice. importantly, this study also demonstrated that the balb/c mouse strain was an appropriate genetic background for carrying the gabab(1) isoform mutations.    initial studies with gabab(1) isoform-deficient mice demonstrated that they were free of gross sensory-motor deficits that may preclude their application in behavioural tasks. furthermore, gabab(1a) and gabab(1b) diverged in their influences on locomotor responses to novelty and circadian activity, although the gabab receptor agonists baclofen or γ-hydroxybutyrate (ghb) were not specific for either isoform and were unable to discriminate these differences. these findings demonstrated that the gabab(1) isoforms had differential influences on behaviour. together these studies demonstrated that the gabab(1a)-/- and gabab(1b)-/- mice were applicable for testing the hypothesis that the gabab(1) isoforms were differentially implicated in anxiety and depression related behaviour.    gabab(1) isoforms in endophenotypes of anxiety and depression:  deletion of gabab(1a) and gabab(1b) isoforms had profound, differential impacts on the acquisition (gabab(1a)) and extinction (gabab(1b)) of aversive memories, as determined in a conditioned taste aversion paradigm. these effects, however, were not accompanied by differences in innate anxiety, as assessed in a comprehensive test battery of unconditioned anxiety tests, including autonomic (stress-induced hyperthermia), active (marble burying) and passive exploratory avoidance (staircase, light-dark box, elevated plus maze, elevated zero maze) behavioural readouts. there was no evidence for a specific influence of either isoform in these tests. this indicated that the gabab(1) isoforms themselves did not have a defining role in innate anxiety.  gabab(1a)-/- and gabab(1b)-/- mice diverged in their cognitive phenotypes. gabab(1a)-/- mice were impaired in tasks of working spatial and recognition memory, but not in passive avoidance. gabab(1b)-/- mice were also impaired, to a lesser degree, in a working spatial memory task, but showed preservation of working recognition memory and passive avoidance. long term recognition memory, however, was also impaired in these mice.  the gabab(1a) isoform was specifically implicated in depression-related behaviour, as indicated by reduced immobility in a classic test of antidepressant-like behaviour – the forced swim test. this was most probably mediated via the striking interactions of the gabab(1a) isoform with the serotonergic system, as illustrated in particular by the profound desensitisation of presynaptic 5-ht1a receptors in gabab(1a)-/- mice. a lack of effect on 5-ht1a receptor expression in gabab(1a)-/- mice, as indicated by normal 5-ht1a autoradiography densities, suggested an intracellular mechanism for this desensitisation.    together these studies demonstrated that the gabab(1) isoforms are functionally important variants of the gabab receptor, with specific relevance in depression and to aversive learning and memory processes that underlie cognitive symptoms in anxiety disorders.  b-type receptors for the neurotransmitter gaba (γ-aminobutyric acid) inhibit neuronal activity through g-protein-coupled second-messenger systems, which regulate the release of neurotransmitters and the activity of ion channels and adenylyl cyclase. physiological and biochemical studies show that there are differences in drug efficiencies at different gabab receptors, so it is expected that gabab-receptor (gababr) subtypes exist. two gabab-receptor splice variants have been cloned (gababr1a and gababr1b), but native gabab receptors and recombinant receptors showed unexplained differences in agonist-binding potencies. moreover, the activation of presumed effector ion channels in heterologous cells expressing the recombinant receptors proved difficult,. here we describe a new gabab receptor subtype, gababr2, which does not bind available gabab antagonists with measurable potency. gababr1a, gababr1b and gababr2 alone do not activate kir3-type potassium channels efficiently, but co-expression of these receptors yields a robust coupling to activation of kir3 channels. we provide evidence for the assembly of heteromeric gabab receptors in vivo and show that gababr2 and gababr1a/b proteins immunoprecipitate and localize together at dendritic spines. the heteromeric receptor complexes exhibit a significant increase in agonist- and partial-agonist-binding potencies as compared with individual receptors and probably represent the predominant native gabab receptor. heteromeric assembly among g-protein-coupled receptors has not, to our knowledge, been described before.
echocardiography can be used to estimate myocardial contractility by the assessment of the circumferential end-systolic stress-corrected left ventricular (lv) fractional shortening measured at midwall level (stress-corrected mws). whether stress-corrected mws at rest predicts exercise peak oxygen uptake (peak v̇o2) is unknown. also, it is not known whether the propagation rate of the early lv filling wave (e wave propagation rate, v̇p), a new pre-load insensitive index of lv diastolic function, and echocardiographically assessed indices of arterial stiffness correlate to peak v̇o2. accordingly, we performed echocardiographic studies and exercise tests with respiratory gas analysis in 15 young healthy male subjects (mean age 27 years, range 18–36). neither stress-corrected-mws (r=0.20, p=ns) nor ejection fraction (r=−0.05, p=ns) correlated significantly with peak v̇o2. adjustment for age and resting heart rate had no effect on the results. in separate multiple regression models adjusting for standard covariates (age, lv size and heart rate), peak v̇o2 correlated with v̇p (beta=0.98, p<0.01), as well as with e/a (beta=0.85, p<0.01), and with the isovolumic relaxation time (indicator of lv relaxation) (beta=−0.59, p<0.05). arterial stiffness indices showed no significant relation to peak v̇o2. we conclude that in young healthy male subjects, resting myocardial contractility and arterial stiffness are not significant correlates of peak v̇o2, whereas lv diastolic function, and in particular v̇p, influences the variability of peak v̇o2.  objectives the study was done to evaluate reliability of echocardiographic left ventricular (lv) mass.   background echocardiographic estimation of lv mass is affected by several sources of variability.   methods we assessed intrapatient reliability of lv mass measurements in 183 hypertensive patients (68% men, 65 +/- 9 years) enrolled in the prospective randomized enalapril study evaluating regression of ventricular enlargement (preserve) trial after a screening echocardiogram (echo) showed lv hypertrophy. a second echo was repeated at randomization (45 +/- 25 days later). two-dimensional (2d)-guided m-mode or 2d linear measurements of lv cavity and wall dimensions were verified by one experienced reader.   results mean lv mass was similar at first and second echo (243 +/- 53 vs. 241 +/- 54 g) and showed high reliability as estimated by intraclass correlation coefficient (rho) = 0.93. within-patient 5th, 10th, 90th and 95th percentiles of between-study difference in lv mass were -32 g, -28 g, +25 g and +35 g. mean lv mass fell less from the first to the second echo than expected from a formula to predict regression to the mean (2 +/- 19 vs. 17 +/- 12 g, p < 0.001). reliability was also high for lv internal diameter (rho = 0.87), septal (rho = 0.85) and posterior wall thickness (rho = 0.83). substantial or moderate reliability was observed for measures of lv systolic function and diastolic filling (rho from 0.71 to 0.57).   conclusions left ventricular mass had high reliability and little regression to the mean; between-study lv mass change of +/-35 g or +/-17 g had > or = 95% or > or = 80% likelihood of being true change.
spike threshold filters incoming inputs and thus gates activity flow through neuronal networks. threshold is variable, and in many types of neurons there is a relationship between the threshold voltage and the rate of rise of the membrane potential (dvm/dt) leading to the spike. in primary sensory cortex this relationship enhances the sensitivity of neurons to a particular stimulus feature. while na+ channel inactivation may contribute to this relationship, recent evidence indicates that k+ currents located in the spike initiation zone are crucial. here we used a simple hodgkin-huxley biophysical model to systematically investigate the role of k+ and na+ current parameters (activation voltages and kinetics) in regulating spike threshold as a function of dvm/dt. threshold was determined empirically and not estimated from the shape of the vm prior to a spike. this allowed us to investigate intrinsic currents and values of gating variables at the precise voltage threshold. we found that na+ inactivation is sufficient to produce the relationship provided it occurs at hyperpolarized voltages combined with slow kinetics. alternatively, hyperpolarization of the k+ current activation voltage, even in the absence of na+ inactivation, is also sufficient to produce the relationship. this hyperpolarized shift of k+ activation allows an outward current prior to spike initiation to antagonize the na+ inward current such that it becomes self-sustaining at a more depolarized voltage. our simulations demonstrate parameter constraints on na+ inactivation and the biophysical mechanism by which an outward current regulates spike threshold as a function of dvm/dt.  a slowly inactivating, low-threshold k(+) current has been implicated in the regulation of state transitions and repetitive activity in striatal medium spiny neurons. however, the molecular identity of the channels underlying this current and their biophysical properties remain to be clearly determined. because previous work had suggested this current arose from kv1 family channels, high-affinity toxins for this family were tested for their ability to block whole cell k(+) currents activated by depolarization of acutely isolated neurons. alpha-dendrotoxin, which blocks channels containing kv1.1, kv1.2, or kv1.6 subunits, decreased currents evoked by depolarization. three other kv1 family toxins that lack a high affinity for kv1.2 subunits, r-agitoxin-2, dendrotoxin-k, and r-margatoxin, failed to significantly reduce currents, implicating channels with kv1.2 subunits. rt-pcr results confirmed the expression of kv1.2 mrna in identified medium spiny neurons. currents attributable to kv1.2 channels activated rapidly, inactivated slowly, and recovered from inactivation slowly. in the subthreshold range (ca. -60 mv), these currents accounted for as much as 50% of the depolarization-activated k(+) current. moreover, their rapid activation and relatively slow deactivation suggested that they contribute to spike afterpotentials regulating repetitive discharge. this inference was confirmed in current-clamp recordings from medium spiny neurons in the slice preparation where kv1.2 blockade reduced first-spike latency and increased discharge frequency evoked from hyperpolarized membrane potentials resembling the "down-state" found in vivo. these studies establish a clear functional role for somato-dendritic kv1.2 channels in the regulation of state transitions and repetitive discharge in striatal medium spiny neurons.
neuroimaging work from developmental and reading intervention research has suggested a cause of reading failure may be lack of engagement of parietotemporal cortex during initial acquisition of grapheme-phoneme (letter-sound) mappings. parietotemporal activation increases following grapheme-phoneme learning and successful reading intervention. further, stimulation of parietotemporal cortex improves reading skill in lower ability adults. however, it is unclear whether these improvements following stimulation are due to enhanced grapheme-phoneme mapping abilities. to test this hypothesis, we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tdcs) to manipulate parietotemporal function in adult readers as they learned a novel artificial orthography with new grapheme-phoneme mappings. participants received real or sham stimulation to the left inferior parietal lobe (l ipl) for 20 min before training. they received explicit training over the course of 3 days on 10 novel words each day. learning of the artificial orthography was assessed at a pre-training baseline session, the end of each of the three training sessions, an immediate post-training session and a delayed post-training session about 4 weeks after training. stimulation interacted with baseline reading skill to affect learning of trained words and transfer to untrained words. lower skill readers showed better acquisition, whereas higher skill readers showed worse acquisition, when training was paired with real stimulation, as compared to readers who received sham stimulation. however, readers of all skill levels showed better maintenance of trained material following parietotemporal stimulation, indicating a differential effect of stimulation on initial learning and consolidation. overall, these results indicate that parietotemporal stimulation can enhance learning of new grapheme-phoneme relationships in readers with lower reading skill. yet, while parietotemporal function is critical to new learning, its role in continued reading improvement likely changes as readers progress in skill.  1 in this paper we demonstrate in the intact human the possibility of a non‐invasive modulation of motor cortex excitability by the application of weak direct current through the scalp. 2 excitability changes of up to 40 %, revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation, were accomplished and lasted for several minutes after the end of current stimulation. 3 excitation could be achieved selectively by anodal stimulation, and inhibition by cathodal stimulation. 4 by varying the current intensity and duration, the strength and duration of the after‐effects could be controlled. 5 the effects were probably induced by modification of membrane polarisation. functional alterations related to post‐tetanic potentiation, short‐term potentiation and processes similar to postexcitatory central inhibition are the likely candidates for the excitability changes after the end of stimulation. transcranial electrical stimulation using weak current may thus be a promising tool to modulate cerebral excitability in a non‐invasive, painless, reversible, selective and focal way.
human respiratory syncytial virus group a (rsv‐a) was detected in symptomatic hospital attended children in central spain for a continuous time period, september 2010 to april 2015. in order to accurately describe the epidemiology of this virus, the genetic diversity of the complete g gene and the clinical manifestations observed were jointly analyzed. out of 3,011 respiratory specimens taken from 2,308 children, 640 were positive to rsv (21.3%) and 405 were rsv‐a (63.2%). complete g gene sequences of 166 randomly selected rsv‐a virus identified na1 and on1 genotypes. in 2011–2012, on1 emerged sporadically and become dominant in 2012–2013 with 38 cases (70%). in 2014–2015, all the 44 sequences contained the 72‐nt duplication (100%). clinical diagnosis of children with on1 genotype were bronchiolitis in 55 (62.5%), recurrent wheezing or asthma exacerbations in 22 (25%), laryngotracheobronchitis in 3 (3.4%), and upper respiratory tract infections in eight. results showed replacement and substitution of circulating na1 genotype with the new on1 genotype. nevertheless, at this stage, none of the rsv‐a genotypes identified have resulted in significant clinical differences. the amino acid composition of the complete g gene on1 sequences demonstrated an accumulation of single changes not related with different clinical presentation. j. med. virol. 89:767–774, 2017. © 2016 wiley periodicals, inc.  human respiratory syncytial virus (hrsv) is the main cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children under 2 years of age and causes repeated infections throughout life. we investigated the genetic variability of rsv-a circulating in ontario during 2010–2011 winter season by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the g glycoprotein gene. among the 201 consecutive rsv isolates studied, rsv-a (55.7%) was more commonly observed than rsv-b (42.3%). 59.8% and 90.1% of rsv-a infections were among children ≤12 months and ≤5 years old, respectively. on phylogenetic analysis of the second hypervariable region of the 112 rsv-a strains, 110 (98.2%) clustered within or adjacent to the na1 genotype; two isolates were ga5 genotype. eleven (10%) na1-related isolates clustered together phylogenetically as a novel rsv-a genotype, named on1, containing a 72 nucleotide duplication in the c-terminal region of the attachment (g) glycoprotein. the predicted polypeptide is lengthened by 24 amino acids and includes a23 amino acid duplication. using rna secondary structural software, a possible mechanism of duplication occurrence was derived. the 23 amino acid on1 g gene duplication results in a repeat of 7 potential o-glycosylation sites including three o-linked sugar acceptors at residues 270, 275, and 283. using phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood analysis, a total of 19 positively selected sites were observed among ontario na1 isolates; six were found to be codons which reverted to the previous state observed in the prototype rsv-a2 strain. the tendency of codon regression in the g-ectodomain may infer a decreased avidity of antibody to the current circulating strains. further work is needed to document and further understand the emergence, virulence, pathogenicity and transmissibility of this novel rsv-a genotype with a72 nucleotide g gene duplication.
human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv-16) is the major causative agent of cervical cancer. to date, vaccine strategies against hpv-16 are based on the ability of the e7 oncoprotein to elicit an immune response against this virus. in this study, the use of an inducible or a constitutive system to produce the hpv-16 e7 protein in lactococcus lactis, a non-pathogenic and non-invasive gram-positive bacterium, was compared. the highest e7 production was obtained with the inducible system. when mice were immunized intranasally with recombinant lactococci expressing either inducible or constitutive e7, an antigen-specific cellular response (i.e. secretion of il2 and ifn-gamma cytokines) was evoked and was substantially higher in mice receiving l. lactis expressing e7 with the inducible system. as bacterial antigen location may influence the immune response, recombinant l. lactis strains that produced e7 in three cellular locations, intracellular, secreted or cell-wall-anchored were evaluated. the highest immune response was elicited by administration of l. lactis producing an inducible cell-wall-anchored form of e7 protein. these promising results represent a step towards the development of a new, safe mucosal vector to treat hpv-related cervical cancer.  abstract interleukin-12 (il-12), a heterodimeric cytokine, plays an important role in cellular immunity to several bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections and has adjuvant activity when it is codelivered with dna vaccines. il-12 has also been used with success in cancer immunotherapy treatments. however, systemic il-12 therapy has been limited by high levels of toxicity. we describe here inducible expression and secretion of il-12 in the food-grade lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis. il-12 was expressed as two separate polypeptides (p35-p40) or as a single recombinant polypeptide (scil-12). the biological activity of il-12 produced by the recombinant l. lactis strain was confirmed in vitro by its ability to induce gamma interferon (ifn-γ) production by mouse splenocytes. local administration of il-12-producing strains at the intranasal mucosal surface resulted in ifn-γ production in mice. the activity was greater with the single polypeptide scil-12. an antigen-specific cellular response (i.e., secretion of th1 cytokines, il-2, and ifn-γ) elicited by a recombinant l. lactis strain displaying a cell wall-anchored human papillomavirus type 16 e7 antigen was dramatically increased by coadministration with an l. lactis strain secreting il-12 protein. our data show that il-12 is produced and secreted in an active form by l. lactis and that the strategy which we describe can be used to enhance an antigen-specific immune response and to stimulate local mucosal immunity.
traditional theories of forgetting assume that everyday forgetting is a cue-overload phenomenon, and the primary laboratory method used for investigating that phenomenon has long been the a-b, a-c paired-associates procedure. a great deal of research in psychology, psychopharmacology, and neuroscience suggests that this approach to the study of forgetting may not be very relevant to the kind of interference that induces most forgetting in everyday life. an alternative interference theory holds that recently formed memories that have not yet had a chance to consolidate are vulnerable to the interfering force of mental activity and memory formation, even if the interfering activity does not involve material similar to what was previously learned. this account helps to explain why sleep, alcohol, and benzodiazepines all forestall forgetting of a recently learned list, and it is consistent with recent work on the variables that affect the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.  i know of no one who seriously maintains that interference among tasks is of no consequence in the production of forgetting. whether forgetting is conceptualized at a strict psychological level or at a neural level (e.g., neural memory trace), some provision is made for interference to account for at least some of the measured forgetting. the many studies on retroactive inhibition are probably responsible for this general agreement that interference among tasks must produce a sizable proportion of forgetting. by introducing an interpolated interfering task very marked decrements in recall can be produced in a few minutes in the laboratory. but there is a second generalization which has resulted from these studies, namely, that most forgetting must be a function of the learning of tasks which interfere with that which has already been learned (19). thus, if a single task is learned in the laboratory and retention measured after a week, the loss has been attributed to the interference from activities learned outside the laboratory during the week. it is this generalization with which i am concerned in the initial portions of this paper. now, i cannot deny the data which show large amounts of forgetting produced by an interpolated list in a few minutes in the laboratory. nor do i deny that this loss may be attributed to interference. but i will try to show 1 address of the president, midwestern psychological association, st. louis, missouri,
within the mitotic spindle, specific interactions between microtubules, chromosomes and numerous accessory proteins allow the generation of spatially regulated forces that bring about accurate chromosome segregation. generation of this proper spatial regulation requires that individual proteins be targeted to specific substructures within the spindle. for example, the kinesin-related protein cenp-e is targeted specifically to the corona fibers of kinetochores (yao et al., 1997) where its action is required during alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate (schaar et al., 1997; wood et al., 1997). in contrast, the protein numa (nuclear mitotic antigen) is concentrated at spindle poles where its activity appears to be required for the focused organization of microtubules (gaglio et al., 1995). the vertebrate mitotic spindle pole is a microtubuledependent region surrounding the centrioles and centrosome at each of the two ends of the bipolar mitotic spindle. numa, γtubulin and katanin are proteins whose localization define the spindle pole. numa associates exclusively with the microtubule-dependent spindle pole during mitosis and does not associate with interphase centrosomes (price and pettijohn, 1986; dionne et al., 1999). in contrast, localization of γ-tubulin to the interphase or mitotic centrosome does not require intact microtubules (khodjakov and rieder, 1999; stearns et al., 1991; zheng et al., 1991). however, localization of additional γ-tubulin that surrounds the centrosomes only during mitosis does require microtubules (mcnally and thomas, 1998; khodjakov and rieder, 1999). like numa, the sea urchin protein, katanin, is concentrated in a microtubule-dependent structure surrounding the γ-tubulin at the poles of embryonic spindles (mcnally et al., 1996). antibodies recognizing mammalian homologs of katanin also recognize large microtubule-dependent structures surrounding γ-tubulin foci at spindle poles in several cell types and, in addition, recognize a smaller microtubule-independent focus at the centrosome in some cell types (mcnally and thomas, 1998). sea urchin katanin severs microtubules in an atp-dependent manner in vitro (mcnally and vale, 1993) and is thought to be important in releasing microtubules from their centrosomal attachment points in vivo. indeed, microinjection of antibodies recognizing a vertebrate katanin homolog into neurons results in the accumulation of microtubules attached to the centrosome (ahmad et al., 1999), indicating that katanin-mediated microtubule severing is responsible for the release of microtubules from the neuronal centrosome. the concentration of katanin in mitotic spindle poles (mcnally and thomas, 1998) and the specific activation of katanin’s activity in mphase xenopus extracts (vale, 1991; mcnally and thomas, 1998) suggest that katanin may also sever microtubules from their centrosomal attachments during mitosis in non-neuronal cells. katanin’s localization in spindle poles may increase the efficiency of this centrosomal release reaction and thus allow 1623 journal of cell science 113, 1623-1633 (2000) printed in great britain © the company of biologists limited 2000 jcs1028  microtubules are dynamic structures whose proper rearrangement during the cell cycle is essential for the positioning of membranes during interphase and for chromosome segregation during mitosis. the previous discovery of a cyclin b/cdc2-activated microtubule-severing activity in m-phase xenopus egg extracts suggested that a microtubule-severing protein might play an important role in cell cycle-dependent changes in microtubule dynamics and organization. however, the isolation of three different microtubule-severing proteins, p56, ef1alpha, and katanin, has only confused the issue because none of these proteins is directly activated by cyclin b/cdc2. here we use immunodepletion with antibodies specific for a vertebrate katanin homologue to demonstrate that katanin is responsible for the majority of m-phase severing activity in xenopus eggs. this result suggests that katanin is responsible for changes in microtubules occurring at mitosis. immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that katanin is concentrated at a microtubule-dependent structure at mitotic spindle poles in xenopus a6 cells and in human fibroblasts, suggesting a specific role in microtubule disassembly at spindle poles. surprisingly, katanin was also found in adult mouse brain, indicating that katanin may have other functions distinct from its mitotic role.
background the ability to identify individuals at increased risk of developing tuberculosis (tb) has important implications for public health policy and patient care. we conducted a general population historical cohort study in all australian states and territories to establish the risk of tb arising in people on chronic hemo- or peritoneal dialysis. methodology/principal findings cases of tb disease in patients receiving chronic dialysis were identified by record linkage using the australia & new zealand dialysis and transplant registry (anzdata) and state and territory tb notification databases 2001 to 2006. main outcome measure was the relative risk of tb in people on dialysis, adjusted for tb incidence in country of birth, sex, age and indigenous status. a total of 6,276 cases of active tb were reported among 19,855,283 people living in australia between 2001 and 2006. among 14,506 patients on dialysis, 37 had a notification for tb disease after commencing dialysis, of whom 28 were culture positive. the incidence of tb was 66.8/100,000/year (95% ci 47.7 to 93.2) among people on dialysis and 5.7/100,000/year (95% ci 5.5 to 5.8) in the general population. the adjusted relative risk (arr) of tb in people on dialysis was 7.8 (95% ci 3.3 to 18.7), and the arr of culture positive tb was 8.6 (95% ci 3.9 to 19.3). conclusions/significance patients on dialysis are at increased risk of tb. the final decision to screen for, and to treat, ltbi in individual dialysis patients will be influenced by a cumulative assessment of the risk of reactivation of tb and by assessment of risk factors for adverse effects of treatment.  patients with chronic renal failure maintained on intermittent hemodialysis have frequent infections and a suboptimal response to vaccinations. dendritic cells are potent antigen-presenting cells essential for the initiation and maintenance of innate and adaptive immunity. in this study we used uremic sera from hemodialysis patients to measure its impact on monocyte and monocyte-derived dendritic cell function in vitro. monocytes from healthy and uremic subjects were isolated using immunomagnetic beads and differentiated into dendritic cells in the presence of either complete sera or sera from hemodialysis patients. dendritic cells from normal patients cultured in uremic sera had decreased endocytosis and impaired maturation. these cells, however, had enhanced il-12p70 production and increased allogeneic t-cell proliferation compared to cells of normal subjects cultured in normal sera. monocyte derived dendritic cells of hemodialysis patients cultured in either normal or uremic sera were functionally impaired for endocytosis and maturation but had enhanced il-12p70 production and allogeneic t-cell proliferation only when cultured with uremic sera. high concentrations of urea in normal sera inhibited all aspects of normal dendritic cell function in vitro. our study suggests that hemodialysis regimes tailored to remove uremic toxins more efficiently may improve immune functions of these patients.
we introduce an infinite class of polynomial sequences $a_t(n;z)$ with integer parameter $t\geq 1$, which reduce to the well-known stern (diatomic) sequence when $z=1$ and are $(0,1)$-polynomials when $t\geq 2$. using these polynomial sequences, we derive two different characterizations of all hyperbinary expansions of an integer $n\geq 1$. furthermore, we study the polynomials $a_t(n;z)$ as objects in their own right, obtaining a generating function and some consequences. we also prove results on the structure of these sequences, and determine expressions for the degrees of the polynomials.  we define a q-analogue of the calkin-wilf tree and the calkin-wilf sequence. we show that the nth term f(n;q) of the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf sequence is the generating function for the number of hyperbinary expansions of n according to the number of powers that are used exactly twice. we also present formulae for branches within the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf tree and predecessors and successors of terms in the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf sequence.
backgroundmyc family members are among the most frequently deregulated oncogenes in human cancers, yet direct therapeutic targeting of myc in cancer has been challenging thus far. synthetic lethality provides an opportunity for therapeutic intervention of myc-driven cancers.methodsa pooled kinase shrna library screen was performed and next-generation deep sequencing efforts identified that prkdc was synthetically lethal in cells overexpressing myc. genes and proteins of interest were knocked down or inhibited using rnai technology and small molecule inhibitors, respectively. quantitative rt-pcr using taqman probes examined mrna expression levels and cell viability was assessed using celltiter-glo (promega). western blotting was performed to monitor different protein levels in the presence or absence of rnai or compound treatment. statistical significance of differences among data sets were determined using unpaired t test (mann–whitney test) or anova.resultsinhibition of prkdc using rnai (rna interference) or small molecular inhibitors preferentially killed myc-overexpressing human lung fibroblasts. moreover, inducible prkdc knockdown decreased cell viability selectively in high myc-expressing human small cell lung cancer cell lines. at the molecular level, we found that inhibition of prkdc downregulated myc mrna and protein expression in multiple cancer cell lines. in addition, we confirmed that overexpression of myc family proteins induced dna double-strand breaks; our results also revealed that prkdc inhibition in these cells led to an increase in dna damage levels.conclusionsour data suggest that the synthetic lethality between prkdc and myc may in part be due to prkdc dependent modulation of myc expression, as well as myc-induced dna damage where prkdc plays a key role in dna damage repair.  dna repair mechanisms are essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity. disruption of gene products responsible for dna repair can result in chromosomal damage. improperly repaired chromosomal damage can result in the loss of chromosomes or the generation of chromosomal deletions or translocations, which can lead to tumorigenesis. the myc protooncogene is a transcription factor whose overexpression is frequently associated with human neoplasia. myc has not been previously implicated in a role in dna repair. here we report that the overexpression of myc disrupts the repair of double-strand dna breaks, resulting in a several-magnitude increase in chromosomal breaks and translocations. we found that myc inhibited the repair of γ irradiation dna breaks in normal human cells and blocked the repair of a single double-strand break engineered to occur in an immortal cell line. by spectral karyotypic analysis, we found that myc even within one cell division cycle resulted in a several-magnitude increase in the frequency of chromosomal breaks and translocations in normal human cells. hence, myc overexpression may be a previously undescribed example of a dominant mutator that may fuel tumorigenesis by inducing chromosomal damage.
rotaviruses are responsible for the acute diarrhea in various mammalian and avian species. the nonstructural proteins nsp2 and nsp5 are involved in the rotavirus replication and the formation of viroplasm, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies within which new viral particles morphogenesis and viral rna replication occur. there are few studies on the genetic diversity of those proteins; thus this study aims at characterizing the diversity of rotavirus based on nsp2 and nsp5 genes in rotaviruses circulating in brazilian pig farms. for this purpose, 63 fecal samples from pig farms located in six different cities in the são paulo state, brazil, were screened by nested rt-pcr. seven strains had the partial nucleotide sequencing for nsp2, whereas in six, the total sequencing for nsp5. all were characterized as genotype h1 and n1. the nucleotide identity of nsp2 genes ranged from 100% to 86.4% and the amino acid identity from 100% to 91.5%. for nsp5, the nucleotide identity was from 100% to 95.1% and the amino acid identity from 100% to 97.4%. it is concluded that the genotypes of the strains circulating in the region of study are in agreement with those reported in the literature for swine and that there is the possibility of interaction between human and animal rotaviruses.  rotaviruses are generally species-specific, but cross-species transmission is possible, as has been demonstrated experimentally. several case studies have indicated infection of humans by animal rotaviruses. comparison of genetic sequences of human and animal rotaviruses often reveals close identity. surveillance of circulating rotaviruses in the human population has revealed the presence of several uncommon genotypes. many of these have been found in domestic animals, and it is possible that they arose in the human population through zoonotic transmission. the low incidence of uncommon strains would suggest that such transmission, or at least the establishment of an animal rotavirus or a human/animal reassortant virus in the human population, does not happen with any great frequency. however, many millions of people will be exposed year on year to animal rotaviruses. this happens within farming communities, and potentially to visitors to the countryside. there may be some measure of environmental contamination through livestock excrement. this exposure may not result in high levels of infection, but some infection could occur. there may be a continual input of rotavirus strains or sequences into the human population from the animal population albeit at a very low level.
backgroundnon-tuberculous mycobacteria (ntm) infection is an increasing problem worldwide. the epidemiology of ntm in most asian countries is unknown. this study investigated the epidemiology, and clinical profile of inpatients in whom ntm was isolated from various anatomical sites in a singaporean population attending a major tertiary referral centre.methodsdemographic profile, clinical data, and characteristics of patients hospitalized with ntm isolates at a major tertiary hospital over two-year period were prospectively assessed (2011–2012). data collected included patient demographics, ethnicity, smoking status, co-morbidities, ntm species, intensive care unit (icu) treatment, and mortality.resultsa total of 485 patients (62.1% male) with 560 hospital admissions were analysed. the median patient age was 70 years. thirteen different ntm species were isolated from this cohort. mycobacterium abscessus (m. abscessus) (38.4%) was most frequently isolated followed by mycobacterium fortuitum (m. fortuitum) (16.6%), mycobacterium avium complex (mac) (16.3%), mycobacterium kansasii (m. kansasii) (15.4%), and mycobacterium gordonae (m. gordonae) (6.8%). most (91%) ntm was isolated from the respiratory tract. the three most common non-pulmonary sites were; blood (2.7%), skin wounds and abscesses (2.1%), and gastric aspirates (1.1%). a third (34.4%) of the study population had prior pulmonary tuberculosis (ptb). there was a significant association between isolated ntm species, and patient age (p = 0.0002). eleven (2.2%) patients received intensive care unit (icu) treatment during the study period and all cause mortality within 1 year of the study was 16.9% (n = 82). of these, 72 (87.8%) patients died of pulmonary causes.conclusionsthe profile of ntm species in singapore is unique. m. abscessus is the commonest ntm isolated, with a higher prevalence in males, and in the elderly. high ntm prevalence is associated with high rates of prior ptb in our cohort.  diseases and therapies that reduce cell-mediated immunity increase the risk of nontuberculous mycobacterial (ntm) disease. extrapulmonary ntm disease, including disseminated, skin, and catheter-related disease, is more common in immunosuppressed than immunocompetent patients. mycobacterium avium complex remains the most common cause of ntm infection, but rapid growers including mycobacterium abscessus, mycobacterium chelonae, and mycobacterium fortuitum play an important role in skin and catheter-related infections. with the exception of antibiotic prophylaxis for aids patients, the prevention of ntm remains difficult. management is complicated, involving restoration of immune function and removal of catheters in addition to treatment with species-specific antibiotics per current guidelines.
isovaleric acidemia (iva, mim 248600) can be a severe and potentially life-threatening disease in affected neonates, but with a positive prognosis on treatment for some phenotypes. this study presents the first application of metabolomics to evaluate the metabolite profiles derived from urine samples of untreated and treated iva patients as well as of obligate heterozygotes. all iva patients carried the same homozygous c.367 g > a nucleotide change in exon 4 of the ivd gene but manifested phenotypic diversity. concurrent class analysis (conca) was used to compare all the metabolites from the original complete data set obtained from the three case and two control groups used in this investigation. this application of conca has not been reported previously, and is used here to compare four different modes of scaling of all metabolites. the variables important in discrimination from the conca thus enabled the recognition of different metabolic patterns encapsulated within the data sets that would not have been revealed by using only one mode of scaling. application of multivariate and univariate analyses disclosed 11 important metabolites that distinguished untreated iva from controls. these included well-established diagnostic biomarkers of iva, endogenous detoxification markers, and 3-hydroxycaproic acid, an indicator of ketosis, but not reported previously for this disease. nine metabolites were identified that reflected the effect of treatment of iva. they included detoxification products and indicators related to the high carbohydrate and low protein diet which formed the hallmark of the treatment. this investigation also provides the first comparative metabolite profile for heterozygotes of this inherited metabolic disorder. the detection of informative metabolites in even very low concentrations in all three experimental groups highlights the potential advantage of the holistic mode of analysis of inherited metabolic diseases in a metabolomics investigation.  isovaleric acidemia (iva) is one of the most common organic acidemias found in south africa. since 1983, a significant number of iva cases have been identified in approximately 20,000 caucasian patients screened for metabolic defects. iva is caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of isovaleryl-coa dehydrogenase (ivd) resulting in the accumulation of isovaleryl-coa and its metabolites. in total, 10 iva patients and three carriers were available for phenotypic and genotypic investigation in this study. all patients were found to be homozygous for a single c.367 g > a (p.g123r) mutation. the amino acid substitution of a glycine to arginine resulted in a markedly reduced steady-state level of the ivd protein, which explains the nearly complete lack of ivd enzyme activity as assessed in fibroblast homogenates. despite the genetic homogeneity of this south african iva group, the clinical presentation varied widely, ranging from severe mental handicap and multiple episodes of metabolic derangement to an asymptomatic state. the variation may be due to poor dietary intervention, delayed diagnosis or even epigenetic and polygenetic factors of unknown origin.
sea quark distributions in the nucleon have naively been expected to be generated perturbatively by gluon splitting in this case there is no reason for the light quark and anti quark sea distributions to be di erent no asymmetries in the strange or heavy quark sea distributions are predicted in the improved parton model however recent experiments have called these naive expectations into question a violation of the gottfried sum rule has been measured in several experiments suggesting that u d in the proton additionally other measurements while not de nitive show that there may be an asymmetry in the strange and anti strange quark sea distributions these e ects may require nonperturbative explanations in this review we rst discuss the perturbative aspects of the sea quark distributions we then describe the experiments that could point to nonperturbative contributions to the nucleon sea current phenomenological models that could explain some of these e ects are reviewed  the quark and gluon distributions of the photon are determined in leading and higher order by imposing a vector-meson dominance (vmd) valencelike structure at a low resolution scale adopted from the pion. this leaves only one free parameter, not sufficiently constrained by vmd, to be fixed by experiment. our predictions are in agreement with presently available data for {ital f}{sub 2}{sup {gamma}}({ital x},{ital q}{sup 2}). simple parametri- zations of the resulting parton distributions are presented in the range 10{sup {minus}5}{approx lt}{ital x}{lt}1, 0.3{approx lt}{ital q}{sup 2}{approx lt}10{sup 6} gev{sup 2} as obtained from the leading- and higher-order evolution equations.
inorganic arsenic, which is extensively metabolised in humans into even more toxic methylated arsenicals, is a potent carcinogen, causing tumours of the skin, lung, urinary bladder, and other organs. it also induces a number of non-cancer effects. consumption of drinking water highly contaminated by arsenic causes serious health problems in some countries in southeastern asia, and arsenic poses problems for drinking-water safety worldwide. existing risk assessments are based on epidemiological studies from regions with high exposure concentrations (in the mg/l range). it is a matter of debate whether these findings are useful at predicting arsenic-induced effects at low concentrations. in recent years numerous epidemiological studies on cancer and non-cancer effects of inorganic arsenic have been published. this work aims at reviewing recent toxicological and epidemiological data on inorganic arsenic with emphasis on effects at low exposure concentrations. information obtained from epidemiological studies is supplemented with mechanistic data from in vitro and in vivo studies. various modes of action for arsenic carcinogenicity are discussed. the information gathered was used to evaluate the reliability of existing cancer-risk assessments and to improve current assessments of non-cancer health effects. a tolerable daily dose, based on epidemiological studies on arsenic-induced skin disorders, is presented.  monomethylarsonic acid (mmav) and dimethylarsinic acid (dmav) are active ingredients in pesticidal products used mainly for weed control. mmav and dmav are also metabolites of inorganic arsenic, formed intracellularly, primarily in liver cells in a metabolic process of repeated reductions and oxidative methylations. inorganic arsenic is a known human carcinogen, inducing tumors of the skin, urinary bladder, and lung. however, a good animal model has not yet been found. although the metabolic process of inorganic arsenic appears to enhance the excretion of arsenic from the body, it also involves formation of methylated compounds of trivalent arsenic as intermediates. trivalent arsenicals (whether inorganic or organic) are highly reactive compounds that can cause cytotoxicity and indirect genotoxicity in vitro. dmav was found to be a bladder carcinogen only in rats and only when administered in the diet or drinking water at high doses. it was negative in a two-year bioassay in mice. mmav was negative in 2-year bioassays in rats and mice. the mode of action for dmav-induced bladder cancer in rats appears to not involve dna reactivity, but rather involves cytotoxicity with consequent regenerative proliferation, ultimately leading to the formation of carcinoma. this critical review responds to the question of whether dmav-induced bladder cancer in rats can be extrapolated to humans, based on detailed comparisons between inorganic and organic arsenicals, including their metabolism and disposition in various animal species. the further metabolism and disposition of mmav and dmav formed endogenously during the metabolism of inorganic arsenic is different from the metabolism and disposition of mmav and dmav from exogenous exposure. the trivalent arsenicals that are cytotoxic and indirectly genotoxic in vitro are hardly formed in an organism exposed to mmav or dmav because of poor cellular uptake and limited metabolism of the ingested compounds. furthermore, the evidence strongly supports a nonlinear dose-response relationship for the biologic processes involved in the carcinogenicity of arsenicals. based on an overall review of the evidence, using a margin-of-exposure approach for mmav and dmav risk assessment is appropriate. at anticipated environmental exposures to mmav and dmav, there is not likely to be a carcinogenic risk to humans.
the present study describes a complete and detailed neuroanatomical distribution map of the phospholipase c beta1 (plcβ1) isoform along the adult rat neuraxis, and defines the phenotype of cells expressing plcβ1, along with its subcellular localization in cortical neurons as assessed by double-immunofluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning. immunohistochemical labeling revealed a considerable morphological heterogeneity among plcβ1-positive cells in the cortex, even though there was a marked predominance of pyramidal morphologies. as an exception to the general non-matching distribution of gfap and plcβ1, a high degree of co-expression was observed in radial glia-like processes of the spinal cord white matter. in the somatosensory cortex, the proportion of gabaergic neurons co-stained with plcβ1 was similar (around 2/3) in layers i, ii-iii, iv and vi, and considerably lower in layer v (around 2/5). double immunofluorescence against plcβ1 and nuclear speckle markers sc-35 and neun/fox3 in isolated nuclei from the rat cortex showed a high overlap of both markers with plcβ1 within the nuclear matrix. in contrast, there was no apparent co-localization with markers of the nuclear envelope and lamina. finally, to assess whether the subcellular expression pattern of plcβ1 involved specifically one of the two splice variants of plcβ1, we carried out western blot experiments in cortical subcellular fractions. notably, plcβ1a/1b ratios were statistically higher in the cytoplasm than in the nuclear and plasma membrane fractions. these results provide a deeper knowledge of the cellular distribution of the plcβ1 isoform in different cell subtypes of the rat brain, and of its presence in the neuronal nuclear compartment.  upon activation of receptors coupled to the gq subclass of g proteins, phospholipase c (plc)β hydrolyses membrane phospholipid to yield a pair of second messengers, inositol 1,4,5‐trisphosphate and 1,2‐diacylglycerol. of four plcβ isoforms, plcβ1 is transcribed predominantly in the telencephalon and its gene inactivation in mice impairs metabotropic glutamate receptor‐ and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor‐dependent hippocampal oscillations, endocannabinoid production in the hippocampus and barrel formation in the somatosensory cortex. here we examined cellular and subcellular distributions of plcβ1 in adult mouse brains. in the telencephalon, high levels of plcβ1 were observed in principal neurons, including pyramidal cells in the cortex and hippocampus, granule cells and mossy cells in the dentate gyrus, and medium spiny neurons in the caudate‐putamen, whereas most interneurons had low levels of or were negative for plcβ1 and, instead, expressed plcβ4. by immunofluorescence, tiny clusters of plcβ1 were distributed in somatodendritic compartments of principal neurons and positioned close to those of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m1 and diacylglycerol lipase‐α, respectively. immunoelectron microscopy revealed that plcβ1 was often associated with the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, cell membrane or postsynaptic density. in particular, it was highly accumulated at the perisynapse of dendritic spines forming asymmetrical synapses. in the cerebellum, plcβ1 was generally low but was enriched in axons and dendrites of basket cells. these results suggest that plcβ1 is the key effector in telencephalic principal neurons and cerebellar interneurons. furthermore, the well‐orchestrated molecular arrangement appears to be the anatomical basis for the specificity, efficiency and convergence of the neuronal phosphoinositide signaling system.
the tc1/mariner superfamily is one of the most widely distributed among the dna transposons in both terrestrial and aquatic organisms. we studied the abundance of the tc1/mariner elements in the genome of the gastropod littorina saxatilis olivi, 1792 (gastropoda: littorinimorpha). for this purpose, nucleotide sequences with a total length of 358877 bp were analyzed. six sequences were found to be similar to the tc1/mariner dna transposons. these sequences were studied for structure, the presence of functional transposase, and the systematic position within the superfamily. in addition, the loci with high homology to the dna transposons of the hat, sola, ginger, enspm/cacta, isl2eu, kolobok, novosib, zisupton, and helitron superfamilies were identified.  a spontaneous white mutation recovered in drosophila mauritiana is unstable and reverts to normal eye color at a frequency greater than 4 per 1,000 x-chromosomes. germ line reversion occurs at a high rate in d. mauritiana males and in interspecific hybrid females, while the rate is depressed in d. mauritiana females. these events are not restricted to the germ line, as cases of variegated patterns of eye pigmentation, indicating somatic reversion, are recovered at a frequency comparable to that of the male germ line reversion rate. germ line reversion events are genetically stable, while the somatic variegation patterns are not heritable. the patterns of eye pigment variegation produced suggests that reversion events are occurring throughout development. whole genome dna digests blotted and probed with the cloned d. melanogaster white gene indicate that this unstable white mutation in d. mauritiana is associated with an insertion of dna that is lost upon reversion to wild type, indicating that this dna insert is in fact a transposable element.
because the p300/cbp-mediated hyperacetylation of rela (p65) is critical for nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) activation, the attenuation of p65 acetylation is a potential molecular target for the prevention of chronic inflammation. during our ongoing screening study to identify natural compounds with histone acetyltransferase inhibitor (hati) activity, we identified epigallocatechin-3-gallate (egcg) as a novel hati with global specificity for the majority of hat enzymes but with no activity toward epigenetic enzymes including hdac, sirt1, and hmtase. at a dose of 100 micromol/l, egcg abrogates p300-induced p65 acetylation in vitro and in vivo, increases the level of cytosolic ikappabalpha, and suppresses tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha)-induced nf-kappab activation. we also showed that egcg prevents tnfalpha-induced p65 translocation to the nucleus, confirming that hyperacetylation is critical for nf-kappab translocation as well as activity. furthermore, egcg treatment inhibited the acetylation of p65 and the expression of nf-kappab target genes in response to diverse stimuli. finally, egcg reduced the binding of p300 to the promoter region of interleukin-6 gene with an increased recruitment of hdac3, which highlights the importance of the balance between hats and histone deacetylases in the nf-kappab-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway. importantly, egcg at 50 micromol/l dose completely blocks ebv infection-induced cytokine expression and subsequently the ebv-induced b lymphocyte transformation. these results show the crucial role of acetylation in the development of inflammatory-related diseases.  ikappabalpha is an inhibitory molecule that sequesters nf-kappab dimers in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. upon stimulation, nf-kappab moves to the nucleus and induces the expression of a variety of genes including ikappabalpha. this newly synthesized ikappabalpha also translocates to the nucleus, removes activated nf-kappab from its target genes, and brings it back to the cytoplasm to terminate the phase of nf-kappab activation. we show here that ikappabalpha enhances the transactivation potential of several homeodomain-containing proteins such as hoxb7 and pit-1 through a nf-kappab-independent association with histone deacetylase (hdac) 1 and hdac3 but not with hdac2, -4, -5, and -6. ikappabalpha bound both hdac proteins through its ankyrin repeats, and this interaction was disrupted by p65. immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated further that ikappabalpha acts by partially redirecting hdac3 to the cytoplasm. at the same time, an ikappabalpha mutant, which lacked a functional nuclear localization sequence, interacted very efficiently with hdac1 and -3 and intensively enhanced the transactivation potential of pit-1. our results support the hypothesis that the nf-kappab inhibitor ikappabalpha regulates the transcriptional activity of homeodomain-containing proteins positively through cytoplasmic sequestration of hdac1 and hdac3, a mechanism that would assign a new and unexpected role to ikappabalpha.
the aims of this study were to determine the complexity of surgery required to revise failed unicompartmental knee replacements and to evaluate the outcome following revision. between 2000 and 2009, 494 cemented oxford phase 3 medial unicompartmental knee replacements were implanted, with 24 (4.9%) requiring revision (mean age: 63.5 years; 58% male). mean time to revision was 3.0 years. all cases were revised to a cemented total knee replacement, with primary components used in 67% and revision components in 33%. at a mean follow-up of 3.2 years the median oxford knee score was 333% with one knee requiring re-revision (5-year survival 933%). most failed unicompartmental knee replacements could be revised without the need for stemmed implants, augmentation, or bone allograft. when bone loss occured it was commonly on the tibial side. good functional outcome for the revised unicompartmental knee replacement was achieved and was comparable to primary knee replacement.  recent reports suggest good outcome results following unicompartmental knee replacement (ukr). however, a number of authors have commented on the problem of osseous defects requiring technically difficult revision surgery. we reviewed clinical outcomes following revision total knee replacement (tkr) for failed ukr and analysed the reasons for failure and the technical aspects of the revision surgery. between 2001 and 2010 our institute performed 132 ukr's out of which 33 required revision to tkr during a period 6 years. demographics, details and indications for primary and revision surgery, the revised prosthesis including augments, technical difficulties and complications were noted. patient outcome assessment was based on the oxford knee score (oks). survival analysis for the ukr prosthesis was calculated using kaplan-meier survival curves. reasons for revision included aseptic loosening, persistent pain, dislocated meniscus, mal-alignment and other compartment osteoarthritis. median time to revision was 19 months (range 2-159). using revision as the end-point the survival proportion at 5-years was 69%. 18 revisions required additional intra-operative constructs including stemmed implants, wedge augmentation or bone graft. the mean 1 year post-operative oks was 29 compared to 39 for primary tkr during the same period (p<0.001). aseptic loosening was the commonest mode of failure. ukr survivorship at a non-specialist institute is considerably lower than at originating centres. two thirds of the revisions were technically difficult and required additional constructs. the clinical outcome after revision surgery was inferior to that of primary tkr. the role of ukr needs to be more clearly defined.
previous studies investigating the association between glutathione s-transferase m1 (gstm1) null genotype and laryngeal cancer risk reported controversial results. thus, a meta-analysis was performed to clarify the effect of gstm1 null genotype on laryngeal cancer risk. a literature search was performed for all possible studies. we estimated summary odd ratio (or) with its 95 % confidence interval (95 % ci) to assess the association. subgroup analyses were performed by ethnicity or the sample size. 24 individual case–control studies involving a total of 2,809 laryngeal cancer cases and 4,478 controls were finally included into this meta-analysis. meta-analyses of total 24 studies showed the gstm1 null genotype was significantly associated with increased laryngeal cancer risk (random-effects or = 1.44, 95 % ci 1.19–1.73, p < 0.001). subgroup analyses by ethnicity showed that the gstm1 null genotype was associated with increased laryngeal cancer risk in both caucasians (fixed-effects or = 1.17, 95 % ci 1.04–1.33, p = 0.012) and asians (random-effects or = 1.89, 95 % ci 1.28–2.77, p = 0.001). also, subgroup analyses by sample size also further identified this association above. the cumulative meta-analyses showed a trend of more obvious association between gstm1 null genotype and increased risk of laryngeal cancer as information accumulated by year. meta-analysis of available data suggests that gstm1 null genotype contributes to increased laryngeal cancer risk in both caucasians and east asians.  glutathione s-transferase (gst) isoenzymes are involved in the detoxification of several tobacco smoke-derived carcinogens. it is thus conceivable that deficiency in gst activity due to homozygous deletion of the gstm1 and gstt1 genes (the null genotypes) may modulate susceptibility to smoking-induced cancers. the effects of the gstm1 and gstt1 null genotypes on laryngeal cancer risk were evaluated using peripheral blood dna from 129 larynx cancer patients and 172 noncancer controls, all of whom were regular smokers. increased larynx cancer risk was related to the gstm1 null genotype [odds ratio (or) = 1.6, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.0-2.8]. the or associated with the gstt1 null genotype was increased, although not significantly (or = 1.4, 95% ci = 0.7-2.9). individuals with concurrent lack of gstm1 and gstt1 genes had a doubled, although not significant, risk for larynx cancer when compared with those having at least one of these genes (or = 2.0, 95% ci = 0.8-5.2) and had almost a 3-fold risk (or = 2.7, 95% ci = 1.0-7.4) when compared with those with both genes. moreover, a significant interaction between the gstm1 genotype and levels of tobacco consumption (p < 0.05) was found; the gstm1 null genotype was associated with an increased risk of larynx cancer among smokers of 20 g/day or less (or = 2.9, 95% ci = 1.3-6.3) but not among heavier smokers (or = 1.0; 95% ci = 0.5-2.0). in contrast, the gstt1 null genotype posed an increased, although not significant, risk among long-term smokers (or = 2.3, 95% ci = 0.9-5.4).
there is great interest in exploiting the opportunity provided by cloud computing platforms for large-scale analytics. among these platforms, apache spark is growing in popularity for machine learning and graph analytics. developing efficient complex analytics in spark requires deep understanding of both the algorithm at hand and the spark api or subsystem apis (e.g., spark sql, graphx). our bigdatalog system addresses the problem by providing concise declarative specification of complex queries amenable to efficient evaluation. towards this goal, we propose compilation and optimization techniques that tackle the important problem of efficiently supporting recursion in spark. we perform an experimental comparison with other state-of-the-art large-scale datalog systems and verify the efficacy of our techniques and effectiveness of spark in supporting datalog-based analytics.  the management of web users' personal information is increasingly distributed across a broad array of applications and systems, including online social networks and cloud-based services. users wish to share data using these systems, but avoiding the risks of unintended disclosures or unauthorized access by applications has become a major challenge. we propose a novel access control model that operates within a distributed data management framework based on datalog. using this model, users can control access to data they own and control applications they run. they can conveniently specify access control policies providing flexible tuple-level control derived using provenance information. we present a formal specification of the model, an implementation built using an open-source distributed datalog engine, and an extensive experimental evaluation showing that the computational cost of access control is modest.
attentional biases to threat are thought to play a central role in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders. various measures have been developed to index these biases; unfortunately, the psychometric properties of response time measures of attentional bias have not been thoroughly evaluated, and the reliability of those that have been evaluated is poor. the current study assessed the reliability and convergent validity of dot probe and emotional cueing bias scores in high-anxious and low-anxious participants in the context of a state anxiety manipulation to increase the likelihood of producing large, potentially reliable attentional biases. one hundred sixty participants completed an anxious or calm mood induction followed by dot probe and emotional cueing tasks. reliability estimates for bias scores in the full sample were low, ranging from 0 to .44; convergent validity estimates were also poor. the anxiety induction did not substantially improve the reliability or validity of the measures. these results underscore the importance of developing new, more reliable attentional bias measures for future research.  testing feasibility and efficacy of psychological treatment via mobile devices is important, given its potential benefits for high-dosage treatment delivery, widespread and inexpensive dissemination, and efficient research methods. we conducted the first randomized controlled trial of attention bias modification training delivered via smartphones, comparing this training to control training in a double-blind design, also including a waitlist condition. all participants performed a variant of dot-probe training involving faces with neutral and disgust (representative of social threat) expressions in brief sessions three times daily over 4 weeks on their own smartphones, at home or anywhere they chose. attention bias modification, also known as cognitive bias modification of attention, training included a contingency to induce attentional deployment away from disgust faces, whereas the control training included no contingency. participants completed weekly internet-based self-report symptom assessments as well as smartphone-delivered dot-probe attention bias assessments, whose reliability findings supported the viability of using smartphones for reaction-time based assessments. the between-groups training effect on attention bias scores was small, showing statistical significance in some analyses and not in others. on measures of social anxiety, intention-to-treat analyses (n = 326) revealed significant pre–post treatment declines with medium to large effect sizes in both training groups, whereas small declines in a waitlist group were nonsignificant. both training groups showed greater reductions in social anxiety than did waitlist; however, the benefits under these two training conditions were statistically indistinguishable. improvements in the two training conditions beyond those of waitlist could be attributable to any factors common to them, but not to the contingency training specific to active attention bias modification training.
the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of eight-week (2 days/week) training periods of plyometric exercises (pt) and neuromuscular electrostimulation (ems) on jump height in young athletes. squat jump (sj), counter movement jump (cmj) and drop jump (dj) were performed to assess the effects of the training protocols 98 athletes (100 & 200m and 100m & 110m hurdles) voluntarily took part in this study, 51 males (52%) and 47 females (48%), 17.91 ± 1.42 years old, and 5.16 ± 2.56 years of training experience. the participants were randomly assigned to four different groups according to the frequency and the timing of the stimulation. analysis of covariance was used to analyze the effects of every training program on jump height. our findings suggest that compared to control (plyometrics (pt) only), the combination of 150hz ems + pt simultaneously combined in an 8 week (2days/week) training program, we could observe significant jump height improvements in the different types of strength: explosive, explosive-elastic, and explosive-elastic-reactive. the combination of pt after ≤ 85 hz ems did not show any jump height significant increase in sprinters. in conclusion, an eight week training program (with just two days per week) of ems combined with plyometric exercises has proven useful for the improvement of every kind of vertical jump ability required for sprint and hurdles disciplines in teenage athletes.  numerous studies have used percutaneous electrical stimulation (pes) in the context of training programs to develop strength and physical performance in healthy populations (sedentary or trained). significant increases in muscle and fiber cross-sectional area, isokinetic peak torque, maximal isometric and dynamic strength, and motor performance skills have been found after pes training. these strength gains are explained on the basis of the characteristics of pes motor units (mus) recruitment: (a) a continuous and exhausting contractile activity in the same pool of mus during the entire exercise period, (b) a supramaximal temporal recruitment imposed by the high frequency chosen (up to 40 hz), and (c) a synchronous recruitment of neighboring fibers. the pes training method is complementary to voluntary training, mainly because the application of pes causes an unconventional spatial recruitment of mus that, depending on the muscular topography, may entail the preferential recruitment of the fast-twitch mus. in addition, the method does not specifically develop elasticity in skeletal muscle, and it must be accompanied by a technical workout.
purposethe goal of the present study was to compare the outcomes of operative and non-operative patients with adult spinal deformity (asd) over 75 years of age.methodsa retrospective review of a multicenter prospective adult spinal deformity database was conducted examining patients with asd over the age of 75 years. demographics, comorbidities, operation-related variables, complications, radiographs, and health-related quality of life (hrqol) measures collected included oswestry disability index, short form-36, and scoliosis research society-22 preoperatively, and at 1 and 2 years later. minimum clinically important difference (mcid) was calculated and also compared.results27 patients (12 operative, 15 non-operative) were studied. there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between operative and non-operative patients for age, body mass-index, and comorbidities, but operative patients had worse baseline hrqol than non-operative patients. operative patients had a significant improvement in radiographic parameters in 2-year hrqol, whereas non-operative patients did not (p > 0.05). operative patients were significantly more likely to reach mcid (range 41.7–81.8 vs. 0–33.3 %, p < 0.05). in the surgical group, 9 (75 %) patients had at least 1 complication (24 total complications).conclusionsin the largest series to date comparing operative and non-operative management of adult spinal deformity in elderly patients greater than 75 years of age, reconstructive surgery provides significant improvements in pain and disability over a 2-year period. furthermore, operative patients were more likely to reach mcid than non-operative patients. when counseling elderly patients with asd, such data may be helpful in the decision-making process regarding treatment.  purpose of the study parameters determining sagittal balance are essential for optimal analysis and treatment of many spinal disorders. the purpose of this work was to validate a software designed to measure the principal parameters involved in sagittal balance of the spine.   material and methods six parameters (lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, sagittal tilt at t9, pelvic index, pelvic tilt, slope of the sacrum) were measured on lateral views of the spine from 100 healthy volunteers free of any spinal disease. two measurement techniques were used: manual measurement and automatic computerized measurement with this software. we hypothesized that manual measures could be accepted as reference values because they are currently the most widely used and because the computerized measurements were obtained using digitalized images that may have modified interpretation. the software was therefore validated by comparing the angles measured manually with the computer output. inter- and intraobserver coefficients of variation were calculated for the two measurement techniques. one operator performed both series of measurements (manual and computerized). two other operators preformed two series of independent measures using one of the measurement techniques. finally, two new operators performed a complete series of measurements using both measurement techniques. comparisons were performed with the t test for paired variables with calculation of the coefficients of correlation. intraclass coefficients of correlation were determined for inter- and intra-observer variability.   results there was an excellent correlation between the manual measurements and the computerized measurements with intra-class coefficients of correlation varying from 0.82 to 0.96. inter- and intra-observer variabilities were comparable for the two measurement techniques used to determine thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, pelvic index, pelvic tilt, and slope of the sacrum. inter- and intra-observer variability was lower when the sagittal tilt was measured with the software specially designed.   conclusion this comparison between two techniques for measuring pelvic and spinal parameters of sagittal balance of the spine demonstrated a good correlation between manual and the computerized measurements obtained with the software to be evaluated. computer-assisted measurements not only provided a saving in time but also minimized inter- and intra-observer variability for the estimation of certain parameters.
arachidonic acid at micromolar concentrations produced a drastic increase of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ros) in rat hepatoma as-30d cells cultivated in vitro along with an increase in the incidence of apoptotic cell death. both processes were prevented by trolox, a water-soluble tocopherol derivative, and tempol, a known antioxidative agent. a synthetic hybrid of lipoic acid and trolox or preincubation with n-acetylcysteine were less effective. preincubation of the cells with etomoxir, a known highly specific irreversible inhibitor of carnitine-palmitoyltransferase i, partly decreased the ros formation induced by arachidonic acid but it did not affect the increase in apoptosis. cumulatively, these results indicate that apoptosis induced in hepatoma cells by arachidonic acid is mediated by ros. they also suggest that this effect is due to arachidonic acid as such and not to its mitochondrial oxidative metabolites.  arachidonic acid and, to a smaller extent, oleic acid at micromolar concentrations decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential within as-30d rat hepatoma cells cultivated in vitro and increased cell respiration. the uncoupling effect of both fatty acids on cell respiration was partly prevented by cyclosporin a, blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. arachidonic acid increased the rate of reactive oxygen species (ros) production, while oleic acid decreased it. both fatty acids induced apoptotic cell death of as-30d cells, accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and association of proapoptotic bax protein with mitochondria; arachidonic acid being a more potent inducer than oleic acid. trolox, a potent antioxidant, prevented ros increase induced by arachidonic acid and protected the cells against apoptosis produced by this fatty acid. it is concluded that arachidonic and oleic acids induce apoptosis of as-30d hepatoma cells by the mitochondrial pathway but differ in the mechanism of their action: arachidonic acid induces apoptosis mainly by stimulating ros production, whereas oleic acid may contribute to programmed cell death by activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
the important role of referring expressions in human communication has inspired much research in the fields of computational linguistics and psycholinguistics. building on the research done by viethen, goudbeek and krahmer (cogsci, 2012) the present study takes a cross-linguistic perspective on examining the use of the colour attribute in distinguishing a target referent. it aims at answering the following research question: does the availability of adequate basic colour terms in a language affect the use of colour in reference production? we conducted a language production experiment with native speakers of dutch and greek. our results confirm that the use of the colour attribute in reference production depends on the colour term resources of a particular language. in addition, we have recorded a large cross-linguistic difference in the proportion of the colour use, which we relate to the particular colour nuances used.  we examine the problem of generating definite noun phrases that are appropriate referring expressions; that is, noun phrases that (a) successfully identify the intended referent to the hearer whilst (b) not conveying to him or her any false conversational implicatures (grice, 1975). we review several possible computational interpretations of the conversational implicature maxims, with different computational costs, and argue that the simplest may be the best, because it seems to be closest to what human speakers do. we describe our recommended algorithm in detail, along with a specification of the resources a host system must provide in order to make use of the algorithm, and an implementation used in the natural language generation component of the idas system.
rna-seq is currently the technology of choice for global measurement of transcript abundances in cells. despite its successes, isoform-level quantification remains difficult because short rna-seq reads are often compatible with multiple alternatively spliced isoforms. existing methods rely heavily on uniquely mapping reads, which are not available for numerous isoforms that lack regions of unique sequence. to improve quantification accuracy in such difficult cases, we developed a novel computational method, prior-enhanced rsem (prsem), which uses a complementary data type in addition to rna-seq data. we found that chip-seq data of rna polymerase ii and histone modifications were particularly informative in this approach. in qrt-pcr validations, prsem was shown to be superior than competing methods in estimating relative isoform abundances within or across conditions. data-driven simulations suggested that prsem has a greatly decreased false-positive rate at the expense of a small increase in false-negative rate. in aggregate, our study demonstrates that prsem transforms existing capacity to precisely estimate transcript abundances, especially at the isoform level.  histones are frequently decorated with covalent modifications. these histone modifications are thought to be involved in various chromatin-dependent processes including transcription. to elucidate the relationship between histone modifications and transcription, we derived quantitative models to predict the expression level of genes from histone modification levels. we found that histone modification levels and gene expression are very well correlated. moreover, we show that only a small number of histone modifications are necessary to accurately predict gene expression. we show that different sets of histone modifications are necessary to predict gene expression driven by high cpg content promoters (hcps) or low cpg content promoters (lcps). quantitative models involving h3k4me3 and h3k79me1 are the most predictive of the expression levels in lcps, whereas hcps require h3k27ac and h4k20me1. finally, we show that the connections between histone modifications and gene expression seem to be general, as we were able to predict gene expression levels of one cell type using a model trained on another one.
the objective of this study was to develop and explore new, in silico experimental methods for deciphering complex, highly variable absorption and food interaction pharmacokinetics observed for a modified-release drug product. toward that aim, we constructed an executable software analog of study participants to whom product was administered orally. the analog is an object- and agent-oriented, discrete event system, which consists of grid spaces and event mechanisms that map abstractly to different physiological features and processes. analog mechanisms were made sufficiently complicated to achieve prespecified similarity criteria. an equation-based gastrointestinal transit model with nonlinear mixed effects analysis provided a standard for comparison. subject-specific parameterizations enabled each executed analog’s plasma profile to mimic features of the corresponding six individual pairs of subject plasma profiles. all achieved prespecified, quantitative similarity criteria, and outperformed the gastrointestinal transit model estimations. we observed important subject-specific interactions within the simulation and mechanistic differences between the two models. we hypothesize that mechanisms, events, and their causes occurring during simulations had counterparts within the food interaction study: they are working, evolvable, concrete theories of dynamic interactions occurring within individual subjects. the approach presented provides new, experimental strategies for unraveling the mechanistic basis of complex pharmacological interactions and observed variability.  absorption models used in the estimation of pharmacokinetic drug characteristics from plasma concentration data are generally empirical and simple, utilizing no prior information on gastro-intestinal (gi) transit patterns. our aim was to develop and evaluate an estimation strategy based on a mechanism-based model for drug absorption, which takes into account the tablet movement through the gi transit. this work is an extension of a previous model utilizing tablet movement characteristics derived from magnetic marker monitoring (mmm) and pharmacokinetic data. the new approach, which replaces mmm data with a gi transit model, was evaluated in data sets where mmm data were available (felodipine) or not available (diclofenac). pharmacokinetic profiles in both datasets were well described by the model according to goodness-of-fit plots. visual predictive checks showed the model to give superior simulation properties compared with a standard empirical approach (first-order absorption rate + lag-time). this model represents a step towards an integrated mechanism-based nlme model, where the use of physiological knowledge and in vitro–in vivo correlation helps fully characterize pk and generate hypotheses for new formulations or specific populations.
hiv-1 and parasitic infections co-circulate in many populations, and in a few well-studied examples hiv-1 co-infection is known to amplify parasite transmission. there are indications that hiv-1 interacts significantly with many other parasitic infections within individual hosts, but the population-level impacts of co-infection are not well-characterized. here we consider how alteration of host immune status due to hiv-1 infection may influence the emergence of novel parasite strains. we review clinical and epidemiological evidence from five parasitic diseases (malaria, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, trypanosomiasis and strongyloidiasis) with emphasis on how hiv-1 co-infection alters individual susceptibility and infectiousness for the parasites. we then introduce a simple modelling framework that allows us to project how these individual-level properties might influence population-level dynamics. we find that hiv-1 can facilitate invasion by parasite strains in many circumstances and we identify threshold values of hiv-1 prevalence that allow otherwise unsustainable parasite strains to invade successfully. definitive evidence to test these predicted effects is largely lacking, and we conclude by discussing challenges in interpreting available data and priorities for future studies.  using dna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we identified four distinct cryptosporidium genotypes in hiv-infected patients: genotype 1 (human), genotype 2 (bovine) cryptosporidium parvum, a genotype identical to c. felis, and one identical to a cryptosporidium sp. isolate from a dog. this is the first identification of human infection with the latter two genotypes.
atomicity is a fundamental property to guarantee the isolation of a work unit (i.e., a sequence of related events in a thread) from concurrent threads. however, ensuring atomicity is often very challenging due to complex thread interactions. we present an approach to help developers verify whether such work units, which have triggered bugs due to certain violations of atomicity, are sufficiently synchronized or not by locks introduced for fixing the bugs. a key feature of our approach is that it combines the fortes of both bug-driven and change-aware techniques, which enables it to effectively verify synchronizations by testing only a minimal set of suspicious atomicity violations without any knowledge on the to-be-isolated work units, thus being more efficient and practical than other approaches. besides, unlike existing approaches, our approach effectively utilizes all the inferred execution traces even they may not be completely feasible, such that the verification algorithm can converge much faster. we demonstrate via extensive evaluation that our approach is much more effective and efficient than the state-of-the-arts. besides, we show that although there have existed sound automatic fixing techniques for atomicity violations, our approach is still necessary and useful for quality assurance of concurrent programs, because the assumption behind our approach is much weaker. we have also investigated one of the largest bug databases and found that insufficient synchronizations are common and difficult to be found in software development.  fixing software bugs has always been an important and time-consuming process in software development. fixing concurrency bugs has become especially critical in the multicore era. however, fixing concurrency bugs is challenging, in part due to non-deterministic failures and tricky parallel reasoning. beyond correctly fixing the original problem in the software, a good patch should also avoid introducing new bugs, degrading performance unnecessarily, or damaging software readability. existing tools cannot automate the whole fixing process and provide good-quality patches.  we present afix, a tool that automates the whole process of fixing one common type of concurrency bug: single-variable atomicity violations. afix starts from the bug reports of existing bug-detection tools. it augments these with static analysis to construct a suitable patch for each bug report. it further tries to combine the patches of multiple bugs for better performance and code readability. finally, afix's run-time component provides testing customized for each patch. our evaluation shows that patches automatically generated by afix correctly eliminate six out of eight real-world bugs and significantly decrease the failure probability in the other two cases. afix patches never introduce new bugs and usually have similar performance to manually-designed patches.
among many mammals, maternal care strongly impacts infant survival; however, less is known about whether adult males also affect infant fitness. paternal care is expected when providing care enhances offspring survival and reproduction, which likewise increases fathers’ fitness. males might also care for unrelated immature individuals to increase their mating probability with the immature individuals’ mothers. studies in multimale primate groups showed that sires enhance food access for offspring and provide protection in conflicts. furthermore, fathers’ presence during infancy has been suggested to accelerate offspring sexual maturation. however, no study has yet directly linked the degree of father-offspring bonds to offspring fitness in primates. we previously reported father-offspring affiliation in rhesus macaques, pronounced during early infancy and independent of mothers’ presence. the present study aims at investigating whether affiliation with fathers or other males affects proxies of immature fitness (body mass gain, body fat and testis size). first, we combined behavioral, genetic and morphometric data from 55 subjects of one group. second, using demographic and genetic data, we investigated for 92 individuals of the population whether mother- and father-offspring co-residence during immaturity influenced offspring lifetime reproductive success (lrs). our results show that focal rank and higher amounts of affiliation with high-ranking males during infancy tend to positively impact body mass gain of female, but not male focal animals. in contrast, body mass gain of male focal individuals, but not females’, appeared to be higher when affiliation of male immature individuals was evenly distributed across their adult male partners. moreover, we found mothers’, but not fathers’, presence during immaturity to predict offspring lrs. our results suggest that male-immature affiliation, but not father-offspring co-residence, potentially impacts proxies of immature fitness. however, future studies should investigate the underlying mechanisms of male-immature relationships and their impact on immature fitness in more detail.  in chacma baboons (papio hamadryas ursinus), adult males and lactating females form preferential associations, or ‘friendships’, that provide protection against potentially infanticidal attacks. little is known about the mechanisms by which males and females form friendships, or the function of friendships for males. we examined the relationship between mating activity, paternity and friendships over a 3-year period. a male’s proportion of consort activity with a female within and outside of her period of most likely conception, along with his dominance rank, each contributed importantly in models of paternity outcomes and formation of friendships. in 87% of births, the male that monopolized the greatest proportion of a female’s consort days during her last conceptive cycle was the father of her offspring. in 82% of the births where the female’s primary consort partner was present at parturition, he became her friend. when the primary consort partner was absent at parturition, females formed friendships with males that had monopolized the second or third greatest proportion of their previous consort days. similarly, 78% of males became friends with females with whom they had obtained their greatest consort success. such a flexible strategy based on probabilistic assessment of paternity may be adaptive for females, given unpredictable fluctuations in male presence within the group. in a mating system with high dominance-based reproductive skew, males may benefit by investing preferentially in those infants that they are most likely to have fathered.
many neurons that initially respond to a stimulus stop responding if the stimulus is presented repeatedly but recover their response if a different stimulus is presented. this phenomenon is referred to as stimulus-specific adaptation (ssa). ssa has been investigated extensively using oddball experiments, which measure the responses of a neuron to sequences of stimuli. neurons that exhibit ssa respond less vigorously to common stimuli, and the metric typically used to quantify this difference is the ssa index (si). this article presents the first detailed analysis of the si metric by examining the question: how should a system (e.g., a neuron) respond to stochastic input if it is to maximize the si of its output? questions like this one are particularly relevant to those wishing to construct computational models of ssa. if an artificial neural network receives stimulus information at a particular rate and must respond within a fixed time, what is the highest si one can reasonably expect? we demonstrate that the optimum, average si is constrained by the information in the input source, the length and encoding of the memory, and the assumptions concerning how the task is decomposed.  neurons in the primary auditory cortex respond less strongly to a commonly occurring “standard” tone than to the same tone when it is rare or “deviant.” this phenomenon, called “stimulus-specific adaptation” (ssa), has been proposed as a possible single-neuron correlate of the mismatch negativity, a cortical evoked potential associated with stimulus novelty. previous studies in cat did not observe ssa in single neurons in the auditory thalamus. however, these reports did not differentiate between the auditory thalamic subdivisions and did not examine the effects of changing the stimulus presentation rate. to explore the possibility of thalamic ssa more completely, we recorded extracellularly from 30 single units and 22 multiunit clusters in the ventral, medial, and dorsal subdivisions of the mouse medial geniculate body (mgb), while presenting the anesthetized animals with sequences of standard and deviant tones at interstimulus intervals of 400, 500 and 800 ms. we found ssa in the auditory thalamus at all three stimulus presentation rates, primarily in the medial subdivision but to a lesser degree also in the ventral mgb. thalamic ssa was evident from the earliest onset of tone-evoked activity, although the latencies of responses to standard and deviant tones were not significantly different. together with related findings of ssa in neurons of the “belt” regions of the inferior colliculus, these results demonstrate that ssa is present at subcortical levels, primarily in but not restricted to the nonlemniscal auditory pathway.
introduction one-year mortality in copd patients is reported to be between 4% and 43%, depending on the group examined. aim to examine the one-year mortality in copd patients after severe exacerbation and the correlation between mortality and patients’ characteristics and comorbidities. methods a total of 152 copd patients hospitalized for severe exacerbation were assessed for vitamin d status, diabetes mellitus (dm), arterial hypertension (ah), and metabolic syndrome (ms). data were gathered about smoking status and number of exacerbations in previous year. cat and mmrc questionnaires were completed by all patients. pre- and post-bronchodilatory spirometry was performed. one-year mortality was established from national death register. results one-year mortality is 7.2%. dm, ms, and vd are not predictors for one-year mortality. however there is a trend for increased mortality in patients with ah (9.5% vs. 2.1%, p = 0.107). there is increased mortality in patients with mmrc > 2 (11.1 vs. 0%, p = 0.013). the presence of severe exacerbation in the previous year is a risk factor for mortality (12.5% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.009). there is a trend for increased mortality in the group with fev1 < 50% (11.5 vs. 4.4%, p = 0.094). cox regression shows 3.7% increase in mortality rate for 1% decrease in fev1, 5.2% for 1% decrease in pef, 7.8% for one year age increase and 8.1% for 1 cat point increase (all p < 0.05). conclusions this study finds relatively low one-year mortality in copd patients after surviving severe exacerbation. grade c and fev1 > 80% may be factors for good prognosis. risk factors for increased mortality are age, fev1 value, severe exacerbation in previous year and reduced quality of life.  the aim of this study was to assess long-term mortality and predictive factors of death after hospital admission for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). 1824 patients (23.2% female; mean age 70.3±11.3 years) consecutively admitted for acute exacerbation of copd in the respiratory medicine departments of 68 general hospitals between october 2006 and june 2007 were prospectively enrolled in a follow-up cohort. their vital status was documented between october 2010 and april 2011. vital status was available for 1750 patients (95.9%), among whom 787 (45%) died during follow-up. multivariate analysis found that age (60–80 years and ≥80 years versus <60 years, relative risk 2.99, 95% ci 2.31–3.89), lower body mass index (25–30 kg·m−2 versus ≤20 kg·m−2, relative risk 0.80, 95% ci 0.66–0.97), lung cancer (relative risk 2.08, 95% ci 1.43–3.01), cardiovascular comorbidity (relative risk 1.35, 95% ci 1.16–1.58), previous hospital admissions for acute exacerbation of copd (four or more versus none, relative risk 1.91, 95% ci 1.44–2.53), use of accessory respiratory muscles (relative risk 1.19, 95% ci 1.01–1.40) or lower-limb oedema (relative risk 1.74, 95% ci (1.44–2.12)) at admission and treatment by long-term oxygen therapy at discharge (relative risk 2.09, 95% ci 1.79–2.45) were independent risk factors of death. mortality rate during the 4 years following hospital admission for acute exacerbation of copd was high (45%). simple clinical information relating to respiratory and general status can help in identifying high-risk patients and targeting more intensive follow-up and care. interestingly, cardiovascular comorbidities and past hospitalisations for acute exacerbation of copd, but not forced expiratory volume in 1 s, independently predicted the risk of death. long-term risk of death after hospitalisation for acute exacerbation of copd is high but can be readily identified http://ow.ly/li4gz
cyclin d1 is widely believed to regulate progression through g1 phase of the cell cycle, and previous studies have shown that this protein is induced during hepatocyte proliferation in culture and in vivo. in this study, the role of cyclin d1 in the cell cycle of primary rat hepatocytes was further examined. following epidermal growth factor stimulation, cyclin d1 was upregulated at time points corresponding to the mitogen restriction point, and this was associated with enhanced cyclin d1-associated kinase activity. to test whether cyclin d1 expression was sufficient to promote mitogen-independent progression through the g1-s transition, we constructed a replication-defective adenovirus that overexpressed human cyclin d1. transfection with the cyclin d1 vector but not a control vector resulted in hepatocyte dna synthesis in the absence of growth factor that was similar to that seen in mitogen-treated cells. furthermore, cyclin d1 transfection led to activation of downstream biochemical events, including cyclin a and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and cyclin e- and cyclin a-associated kinase activation. these results suggest that cyclin d1 expression is sufficient to promote progression of hepatocytes through the g1 restriction point.  in tissue culture systems, p21 and p27 inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) activity and cell cycle progression in response to numerous stimuli, but little is known about their involvement in cell growth in vivo. we examined the modulation of cdk activity by these proteins after 70% partial hepatectomy (ph), an in vivo model of synchronous hepatocyte cell cycle progression. after ph in balb/c mice, p21 was induced during the prereplicative (g1) phase and was maximally expressed after peak hepatocyte dna synthesis. p27 was present in quiescent liver and was minimally induced after ph. p21 and p27 immunoprecipitated with cdk2, cdk4, and cyclin d1 in the regenerating liver. the activity of cdk2-, cdk4- and cyclin d1-associated kinases was upregulated after ph, and maximal activity of these enzyme complexes corresponded to peak dna synthesis. immunodepletion experiments suggested that p27 plays a role in downregulating cdk2 activity before and after peak dna synthesis. compared to cogenic wild-type mice, p21−/− mice demonstrated evidence of markedly accelerated hepatocyte progression through g1 phase after ph: dna synthesis, upregulation of cyclin a and pcna, induction of cyclin d1- and cdk2-associated kinase activity, and appearance of a phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (rb) species occurred earlier in the p21−/− mice. these results suggest that p21 and p27 modulate cdk activity in the regenerating liver, and that p21 regulates the rate of progression through g1 phase of the cell cycle in vivo.
university of minnesota ph.d. dissertation. october 2013. major: plant pathology. advisor: linda l. kinkel. 1 pdf file (viii, 166 pages) + 2 supplementary files (word and excel)  understanding how microbial genotypes are arrayed in space is crucial for identifying local factors that may influence the spatial distribution of genetic diversity. in this study we investigated variation in 16s rdna sequences and rep-pcr fingerprints of streptomyces stains isolated from prairie soil among three locations and four soil depths. substantial variation in streptomyces otu (operational taxonomic unit) and box-pcr fingerprint diversity was found among locations within a limited spatial area (1 m2). further, phylogenetic lineages at each location were distinct. however, there was little variation in genetic diversity among isolates from different soil depths and similar phylogenetic lineages were found at each depth. some clones were found at a localized scale while other clones had a relatively widespread distribution. there was poor correspondence between 16s rdna groupings and rep-pcr fingerprint groupings. the finding of distinct phylogenetic lineages and the variation in spatial distribution of clones suggests that selection pressures may vary over the soil landscape.
in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri), the relationship between positive bold responses (pbrs) and negative bold responses (nbrs) to stimulation is potentially informative about the balance of excitatory and inhibitory brain responses in sensory cortex. in this study, we performed three separate experiments delivering visual, motor or somatosensory stimulation unilaterally, to one side of the sensory field, to induce pbr and nbr in opposite brain hemispheres. we then assessed the relationship between the evoked amplitudes of contralateral pbr and ipsilateral nbr at the level of both single-trial and average responses. we measure single-trial pbr and nbr peak amplitudes from individual time-courses, and show that they were positively correlated in all experiments. in contrast, in the average response across trials the absolute magnitudes of both pbr and nbr increased with increasing stimulus intensity, resulting in a negative correlation between mean response amplitudes. subsequent analysis showed that the amplitude of single-trial pbr was positively correlated with the bold response across all grey-matter voxels and was not specifically related to the ipsilateral sensory cortical response. we demonstrate that the global component of this single-trial response modulation could be fully explained by voxel-wise vascular reactivity, the bold signal standard deviation measured in a separate resting-state scan (resting state fluctuation amplitude, rsfa). however, bilateral positive correlation between pbr and nbr regions remained. we further report that modulations in the global brain fmri signal cannot fully account for this positive pbr-nbr coupling and conclude that the local sensory network response reflects a combination of superimposed vascular and neuronal signals. more detailed quantification of physiological and noise contributions to the bold signal is required to fully understand the trial-by-trial pbr and nbr relationship compared with that of average responses.  the primary somatosensory cortex (si) has been shown to encode the intensity of a stimulus applied to the contralateral side of the body. recent studies have demonstrated that ipsilateral si is also involved in the processing of somatosensory information. in this study, we investigated the dependence of the negative bold response in ipsilateral si on the intensity of somatosensory stimulation. functional mri was performed in 12 healthy subjects during electrical median nerve stimulation at four different intensities. a monotonic relationship between stimulus intensity and the strength of the negative bold response in ipsilateral si was found. additionally, a psychophysiological experiment revealed tight coupling between the stimulus intensity applied to one hand and increased perceptual threshold of the other hand. these findings indicate a stimulus intensity-dependent inhibition of ipsilateral si.
the objective of this study is to examine factors among a group of african american and white men in north carolina and their assessment of prostate cancer treatment choice or belief that treatment chosen was best. a sample of men (n = 877) with a history of prostate cancer diagnosis was recruited from the north carolina cancer registry during 2007–2008 and asked to participate in a telephone interview covering several measures about their initial prostate cancer treatment. logistic regression was used to assess demographic, psychosocial, and clinical factors on whether they felt that they had chosen the best treatment for the disease. respondents were majority white (52.7 %), married (75.9 %), and had surgery (67.9 %) as their initial treatment. at the bivariate level, factors associated with the belief that the treatment chosen was best were as follows: white race/ethnicity, higher levels of education, a more recent treatment date, having health insurance coverage, type of treatment received, higher levels of bother from side effects, greater contentment with their quality of life, and doctor discussions of the various treatment options. similarly, the multivariate analysis showed increased odds of belief that the treatment chosen was the best among demographic (i.e., race/ethnicity, level of education, and health insurance coverage) as well as psychosocial and clinical variables (i.e., greater bother from side effects, greater contentment with their quality of life, and initial treatment received). results suggest that demographic, psychosocial, and clinical factors play an important role for men in assessing their treatment choices for prostate cancer.  patients diagnosed with localized prostate carcinoma need to interpret complicated medical information to make an informed treatment selection from among treatments that have comparable efficacy but differing side effects. the authors reported initial results for treatment decision‐making strategies among men receiving definitive treatment for localized prostate carcinoma.
embryonic stem (es) cells have the potential to differentiate into all cell types of the adult body, and could allow regeneration of damaged tissues. the challenge is to alter differentiation toward functional cell types or tissues by directing es cells to a specific fate. efforts have been made to understand the molecular mechanisms that are required for the formation of the different germ layers and tissues from es cells, and these mechanisms appear to be very similar in the mouse embryo. differentiation toward mesoderm and mesoderm derivatives such as cardiac tissue or hemangioblasts has been demonstrated; however, the roles of activin a/nodal, bone morphogenetic protein (bmp), and fibroblast growth factor (fgf) signaling in the early patterning of es cell-derived pan-mesoderm and anterior visceral endoderm (ave) have not been reported yet. we therefore analyzed the roles of activin a/nodal, bmp, and fgf signaling in the patterning of es cell-derived mesoderm as well as specification of the ave by using a dual es cell differentiation system combining a loss-of-function with a gain-of-function approach. we found that activin a or nodal directed the nascent mesoderm toward axial mesoderm and mesendoderm, while bmp4 was inducing posterior and extraembryonic mesoderm at the expense of anterior primitive streak cells. fgf signaling appeared to have an important role in mesoderm differentiation by allowing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of the newly formed mesoderm cells that would lead to their further patterning. moreover, inhibition of fgf signaling resulted in increased expression of axial mesoderm markers. additionally, we revealed that the formation of ave cells from es cells requires fgf-dependent activin a/nodal signaling and the attenuation of bmp4 signaling.  the vertebrate fgf8 gene produces multiple protein isoforms by alternative splicing. two evolutionarily conserved spliceforms, fgf8a and fgf8b, exhibit distinct bioactivities, with fgf8b having a more potent inductive activity due to higher affinity for fgf receptors. to investigate the in vivo requirement for fgf8b, we created a splice-site mutation abolishing fgf8b expression in mice. analysis of this mutant has uncovered a novel function of fgf8 signaling before the onset of gastrulation. we show that the loss of fgf8b disrupts the induction of the brachyury gene in the pregastrular embryo and, in addition, disrupts the proper alignment of the anteroposterior axis with the shape of the embryo and the uterine axes at embryonic day (e) 6.5. importantly, fgf8-null embryos display the same phenotype as fgf8b-deficient embryos at e6.5, demonstrating that signaling by fgf8b is specifically required for development of the pregastrular embryo. by contrast, during gastrulation, fgf8a can partially compensate for the loss of fgf8b in mesoderm specification. we show that an increased level of fgf8a expression, which leads to fgf4 expression in the primitive streak, can also promote mesoderm migration in the absence of fgf8b. therefore, different fgf signals may have distinct requirements for the morphogenesis and gene regulation before and during gastrulation. importantly, our findings implicate fgf8 in the morphogenetic process that establishes the defined relationship between the axes of the embryo and the uterus at the beginning of gastrulation, a perplexing phenomenon discovered two decades ago.
the extent to which drinking water turbidity measurements indicate the risk of gastrointestinal illness is not well understood. despite major advances in drinking water treatment and delivery, infectious disease can still be transmitted through drinking water in the united states, and it is important to have reliable indicators of microbial water quality to inform public health decisions. the objective of our study was to assess the relationship between gastrointestinal illness, quantified through emergency department visits, and drinking water quality, quantified as raw water and filtered water turbidity measured at the treatment plant. we examined the relationship between turbidity levels of raw and filtered surface water measured at eight major drinking water treatment plants in the metropolitan area of atlanta, georgia, and over 240,000 emergency department visits for gastrointestinal illness during 1993–2004 among the population served by these plants. we fit poisson time-series statistical regression models that included turbidity in a 21-day distributed lag and that controlled for meteorological factors and long-term time trends. for filtered water turbidity, the results were consistent with no association with emergency department visits for gastrointestinal illness. we observed a modest association between raw water turbidity and emergency department visits for gastrointestinal illness. our results suggest that source water quality may contribute modestly to endemic gastrointestinal illness in the study area. the association between turbidity and emergency department visits for gastrointestinal illness was only observed when raw water turbidity was considered; filtered water turbidity may not serve as a reliable indicator of modest pathogen risk at all treatment plants.  study objective to investigate the association between drinking water quality and gastrointestinal illness in the elderly of philadelphia. design within the general population, children and the elderly are at highest risk for gastrointestinal disease. this study investigates the potential association between daily fluctuations in drinking water turbidity and subsequent hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness of elderly persons, controlling for time trends, seasonal patterns, and temperature using poisson regression analysis. setting and participants all residents of philadelphia aged 65 and older in 1992–1993 were studied through their medicare records. main results for philadelphia's population aged 65 and older, we found water quality 9 to 11 days before the visit was associated with hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness, with an interquartile range increase in turbidity being associated with a 9% increase (95% ci 5.3%, 12.7%). in the belmont service area, there was also an association evident at a lag of 4 to 6 days (9.1% increase, 95% ci 5.2, 13.3). both associations were stronger in those over 75 than in the population aged 65–74. this association occurred in a filtered water supply in compliance with us standards. conclusions elderly residents of philadelphia remain at risk of waterborne gastrointestinal illness under current water treatment practices. hospitalisations represent a very small percentage of total morbidity.
aim the aim of the study was to investigate multidimensional theory of mind (tom) abilities in subjects with alcohol use disorder (aud).   method a semi-structured interview and a set of brief stories were used to investigate different components of the participants' tom, namely first- vs. third-person, egocentric vs. allocentric, first- vs. second-order tom in 22 persons with aud plus an equal number of healthy controls. participants were administered the theory of mind assessment scale (th.o.m.a.s., bosco et al., 2009a) and the strange stories test ( happé et al., 1999).   results persons with aud performed worse than controls at all tom dimensions. the patterns of differences between groups varied according to the th.o.m.a.s. dimension investigated. in particular persons with aud performed worse at third-person than at first-person tom, and at the allocentric than at the egocentric perspective.   conclusion these findings support the hypothesis that the ability to understand and ascribe mental states is impaired in aud. future studies should focus on the relevance of the different tom impairments as predictors of treatment outcome in alcoholism, and on the possibility that rehabilitative interventions may be diversified according to tom assessment.  a growing body of literature views theory of mind (tom) as a complex activity involving related but different abilities (e.g., harrington, siegert, & mcclure, 2005; saxe, moran, scholz, & gabrieli, 2006; tirassa, bosco, & colle, 2006). this reflects in the types of experimental tasks that have been proposed in recent years for the assessment of tom in normal and abnormal populations, some of which focus on the ability to understand visual or other perceptual cues as hints to another individual’s mental states (e.g., baron-cohen, wheelwright, hill, raste, & plumb 2001; rutherford, baron-cohen, & wheelwright, 2002; golan, baron-cohen, hill, & rutherford, 2007) and others on the comprehension of complex mental states as encapsulated in short stories or linguistic questions (e.g., baron-cohen, o’riordan, stone, jones & plaitsed, 1999; happé, 1994; pons & harris, 2000). let us discriminate two facets of labels like tom or mindreading. one is the situated ability to understand and react to someone’s mental states (‘‘this thug is planning to assault me – i had better let him see that i carry a knife”); roughly, it is manifestations of this facet that are explored by the first type of experimental tasks mentioned above. another is the retrospective reconsideration of one’s own or another individual’s ways or ability to cope with mentalistic social cognition (‘‘i always feel in danger when people conceal their thoughts”); again roughly, it is manifestations of this facet that are explored by the second type of tasks. each facet may be further analyzed according to more detailed considerations like the distinction between an egocentric and an allocentric perspective or between the various types of epistemic, volitional and other mental states that humans may understand. particularly in developmental psychology, the difference between on-line and retrospective aspects of tom has also been compared to the distinction between implicit and explicit knowledge or functioning of tom (e.g., clements & perner, 1994); however, the latter distinction is often used intuitively, leaving many theoretical questions open (dienes & perner, 1999). to sum up, tom may be viewed as a sophisticated mental activity which allows to quickly form and handle local, situated ideas about oneself or the others in a specific moment as well as more general, less transient ideas about how one and the others tend to live and cope across any number of different and possibly hypothetical situations. both facets of tom have been a focus of research, but, to our knowledge, the conceptual and theoretical relations between them have never been worked out to any satisfactory level of detail and, as discussed above, the experimental paradigms with which they have been studied are quite different. the th.o.m.a.s. interview (bosco et al., 2009) is meant to investigate the retrospective facet of tom, based on a theoretically-driven decomposition thereof that aims at bringing its diversity and complexity into light. there is no way of doing this without recurring to the interviewee’s deliberate introspection and discursive abilities. it is possible that, as badgaiyan (2009) suggests, schizophrenia might affect differently the two facets of tom. yet, there is no reason to think that either one has a systematically more important causal role than the other in the mental life of a healthy or schizophrenic person. instead, they influence each other: the retrospective ability has to build in part upon the reconsideration of previous episodes and situations in which the on-line interpretation of mental states has yielded some interesting lesson to learn; conversely, the on-line interpretation of the current situation has to be informed in part by the individual’s general worldview and biography as well as by the outcomes of and reflections upon situations met in the past. we believe that the retrospective facet of tom plays a fundamental role and that it is crucial to our understanding of social cognition in schizophrenia and elsewhere. another issue raised by badgaiyan concerns the role that memory, language and iq may play in tom activities and in the relevant experimental tasks. truly, certain such activities and tasks require an adequate level of non-tom cognitive function-
in this study the chlorophenol-degrading actinobacterium, arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6, was tested for its ability to grow on mixtures of phenolic compounds. during the experiments depletion of the compounds was monitored, as were cell growth and activity. activity assays were based on bioluminescence output from a luciferase-tagged strain. when the cells were grown on a mixture of 4-chlorophenol, 4-nitrophenol and phenol, 4-chlorophenol degradation apparently was delayed until 4-nitrophenol was almost completely depleted. phenol was degraded more slowly than the other compounds and not until 4-nitrophenol and 4-chlorophenol were depleted, despite this being the least toxic compound of the three. a similar order of degradation was observed in non-sterile soil slurries inoculated with a. chlorophenolicus. the kinetics of degradation of the substituted phenols suggest that the preferential order of their depletion could be due to their respective pka values and that the dissociated phenolate ions are the substrates. a mutant strain (t99), with a disrupted hydroxyquinol dioxygenase gene in the previously described 4-chlorophenol degradation gene cluster, was also studied for its ability to grow on the different phenols. the mutant strain was able to grow on phenol, but not on either of the substituted phenols, suggesting a different catabolic pathway for the degradation of phenol by this microorganism.  abstract arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6, a previously described 4-chlorophenol-degrading strain, was found to degrade 4-chlorophenol via hydroxyquinol, which is a novel route for aerobic microbial degradation of this compound. in addition, 10 open reading frames exhibiting sequence similarity to genes encoding enzymes involved in chlorophenol degradation were cloned and designated part of a chlorophenol degradation gene cluster (cph genes). several of the open reading frames appeared to encode enzymes with similar functions; these open reading frames included two genes, cpha-i and cpha-ii, which were shown to encode functional hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenases. disruption of the cpha-i gene yielded a mutant that exhibited negligible growth on 4-chlorophenol, thereby linking the cph gene cluster to functional catabolism of 4-chlorophenol in a. chlorophenolicus a6. the presence of a resolvase pseudogene in the cph gene cluster together with analyses of the g+c content and codon bias of flanking genes suggested that horizontal gene transfer was involved in assembly of the gene cluster during evolution of the ability of the strain to grow on 4-chlorophenol.
pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the united states. it is identified by its rapid, invasive progression with a profound resistance to treatments such as chemotherapy. unfortunately, there is a lack of information on how to effectively inhibit and control the rapid growth of pancreatic tumors, as well as limited information for diagnostics. with current methods, pancreatic cancer will continue to prevail as a leading cause of cancer death. we propose to study the complexity of pancreatic tumors with a systematic and analytical approach. cancer is an abnormal growth of tissue caused by uncontrolled cell division. observing the growth of these cells would prove to have a good basis to monitor the growth of a tumor. here we create a 3-d simulation of tumor growth through mathematical modeling, using data from pancreatic cells grown in vitro. using 3-d models will help to understand pancreatic tumors at cellular and molecular levels. the project aims to observe realistic growth of the tumor, accomplished from growing tumor cells on a monolayer in order to find parameters for our 3d mathematical model. this method will prove more beneficial than testing only on a monolayer cell line. although cell death and the toxicity of drug dosage can be tested using a cell monolayer alone, it does not meet the demands of testing drug delivery in a realistic tumor environment that the mathematical model would provide. the monolayer lacks the dimensions that the drug would have to travel if it were delivered to a real in vivo tumor. a possible continuation of this project in the future could be to utilize the mathematical based approach to predict optimal therapy for the pancreatic tumor in order to develop models that can better test patient care for tumors. computer modeling, another stepping stone through mathematical modeling, will possibly lead to testing the toxic effects of drugs on a 3-d model through computer modeling will aid in understanding the delivery of drugs throughout the tumor in vivo.  abstract we study solid tumor (carcinoma) growth in the nonlinear regime using boundary-integral simulations. the tumor core is nonnecrotic and no inhibitor chemical species are present. a new formulation of the classical models [18,24,8,3] is developed and it is demonstrated that tumor evolution is described by a reduced set of two dimensionless parameters and is qualitatively unaffected by the number of spatial dimensions. one parameter describes the relative rate of mitosis to the relaxation mechanisms (cell mobility and cell-to-cell adhesion). the other describes the balance between apoptosis (programmed cell-death) and mitosis. both parameters also include the effect of vascularization. our analysis and nonlinear simulations reveal that the two new dimensionless groups uniquely subdivide tumor growth into three regimes associated with increasing degrees of vascularization: low (diffusion dominated, e.g., in vitro), moderate and high vascularization, that correspond to the regimes observed in vivo. we demonstrate that critical conditions exist for which the tumor evolves to nontrivial dormant states or grows self-similarly (i.e., shape invariant) in the first two regimes. this leads to the possibility of shape control and of controlling the release of tumor angiogenic factors by restricting the tumor volume-to-surface-area ratio. away from these critical conditions, evolution may be unstable leading to invasive fingering into the external tissues and to topological transitions such as tumor breakup and reconnection. interestingly we find that for highly vascularized tumors, while they grow unbounded, their shape always stays compact and invasive fingering does not occur. this is in agreement with recent experimental observations [30] of in vivo tumor growth, and suggests that the invasive growth of highly-vascularized tumors is associated to vascular and elastic anisotropies, which are not included in the model studied here.
received 27 july 2008 revised 29 september 2008 accepted 23 october 2008 bovicin hj50 is a new lantibiotic containing a disulfide bridge produced by streptococcus bovis hj50; its encoding gene bova was reported in our previous publication. to identify other genes involved in bovicin hj50 production, dna fragments flanking bova were cloned and sequenced. the bovicin hj50 biosynthesis gene locus was encoded by a 9.9 kb region of chromosomal dna and consisted of at least nine genes in the following order: bova, -m, -t, -e, -f, orf1, orf2, bovk and bovr. a thiol–disulfide oxidoreductase gene named sdb1 was located downstream of bovr. a knockout mutant of this gene retained antimicrobial activity and the molecular mass of bovicin hj50 in the mutant was the same as that of bovicin hj50 in s. bovis hj50, implying that sdb1 is not involved in bovicin hj50 production. transcriptional analyses showed that bova, bovm and bovt constituted an operon, and the transcription start site of the bova promoter was located at a g residue 45 bp upstream of the translation start codon for bova, while bove through bovr were transcribed together and the transcription start site of the bove promoter was located at a c residue 35 bp upstream of bove. we also demonstrated successful heterologous expression of bovicin hj50 in lactococcus lactis mg1363, which lacks thiol–disulfide oxidoreductase genes; this showed that thiol–disulfide oxidoreductase genes other than sdb1 are not essential for bovicin hj50 biosynthesis.  three thermosensitive (ts) suicide vectors, pset4s, pset5s, and pset6s, have been constructed for gene replacement in streptococcus suis. each vector contains an antibiotic-resistance gene (spc or cat), a ts replication origin of pwv01 lineage, multiple cloning sites, lacz', and the cole1 replication origin of puc19. these vectors could be propagated at 37 degrees c in escherichia coli, but their replication was blocked above 37 degrees c in s. suis. moreover, the thermosensitivity of the replication origin was confirmed in s. equi ssp. equi, s. equi ssp. zooepidemicus, and s. dysgalactiae by using pset4s. for inactivation of the sly gene, which encodes a thiol-activated hemolysin of s. suis, pslyk, in which the sly gene was interrupted by the cat gene, was constructed using pset4s and introduced into s. suis dat2. after growth at the nonpermissive temperature under the antibiotic pressure, the chromosomal sly gene was replaced with the sly::cat gene of pslyk by a double-crossover event at a rate of 2.6% among chloramphenicol-resistant cells. moreover, complementation of the sly gene by use of the previously reported s. suis-e. coli shuttle vector pset2 was demonstrated. these results indicate that the ts suicide vectors described here will facilitate the genetic analysis of s. suis and other streptococci of veterinary importance by means of allelic exchange of the genes of interest via homologous recombination.
proinflammatory cytokines and pathogen components activate microglia to release several substances such as nitric oxide (no) produced after the induction of type ii nitric oxide synthase (inos). the present study was designed to elucidate the interaction between the proinflammatory cytokines interferon gamma (ifn-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) on inos expression and no production in microglial cells. in primary mouse microglial cells exposure to ifn-gamma (5 and 10 ng/ml; 48 h) or tnf-alpha (20 ng/ml; 48 h) alone were unable to induce inos expression; however, when cells were exposed to both cytokines together, the expression of this enzyme and the no production in culture media were found significantly increased. in the bv-2 microglial cell line, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha were shown to cooperate in nuclear factor kappa b (nf-kappa b) activation, an essential transcription factor for inos gene transcription. importantly, ifn-gamma induced nf-kappa b binding to dna was totally dependent on the endogenous tnf-alpha released via mek/erk signalling pathway. thus, exposure of bv-2 cells to ifn-gamma in the presence of the selective mek inhibitor u0126 or a neutralizing anti-tnf-alpha antibody significantly reduced ifn-gamma dependent nf-kappa b activation and inos expression. in addition, by activating the jak/stat pathway ifn-gamma potentiated tnf-alpha induced nf-kappa b binding to dna and activated additional transcription factors (i.e. irf-1) known to be essential for inos gene expression. the present findings demonstrate that the proinflammatory cytokines ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha have complementary roles on inos expression in microglial cells and this might be relevant to understand the molecular mechanisms of microglial activation associated with the pathogenesis of several neuroinflammatory disorders in which increased levels of ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha have been reported.  we have reported recently that sodium butyrate suppressed ifn-gamma, but not the lps-mediated induction of nitric oxide and tnf-alpha in microglia via the specific inhibition of nf-kappab. in order to further determine the upstream signaling mechanism involved in the ifn-gamma-specific down-regulation of inos by sodium butyrate in microglia, this study investigated the effect of sodium butyrate on the map kinase activities. sodium butyrate significantly repressed the phosphorylation of erk induced by ifn-gamma, but had little effect on that induced by lps. this suggests that sodium butyrate suppresses the ifn-gamma-induced inos expression by inhibiting the erk to nf-kappab pathway. in addition, it was found that sodium butyrate suppressed the ifn-gamma-induced interferon regulatory factor 1 (irf-1) expression via the inhibition of erk. therefore, the erk signaling pathway appears to play a key role in the sodium butyrate-mediated down-regulation of inos in the ifn-gamma-stimulated microglia.
abstract in this article, we discuss recent evidence from experimental economics on the impact of social preferences on workplace behavior. we focus on situations in which a single employer interacts with multiple employees. traditionally, equity and efficiency have been seen as opposing aims in such work environments: individual pay-for-performance wage schemes maximize of efficiency but might lead to inequitable outcomes. we present findings from laboratory experiments that show under which circumstances partially incomplete contracts can create equitable work environments while at the same time reaching surprisingly efficient outcomes.  we study how different payment modes influence the effectiveness of gift exchange as a contract enforcement device. in particular, we analyze how horizontal fairness concerns affect performance and efficiency in an environment characterized by contractual incompleteness. in our experiment, one principal is matched with two agents. the principal pays equal wages in one treatment and can set individual wages in the other. we find that the use of equal wages elicits substantially lower efforts. this is not caused by monetary incentives per se since under both wage schemes it is profit-maximizing for agents to exert high efforts. the treatment difference instead seems to be driven by the fact that the norm of equity is violated far more frequently in the equal wage treatment. after having suffered from violations of the equity principle, agents withdraw effort. these findings hold even after controlling for the role of intentions, as we show in a third treatment. our results suggest that adherence to the norm of equity is a necessary prerequisite for successful establishment of gift-exchange relations.
although orthotopic heart transplantation is the gold standard for definitive surgical treatment of end-stage heart failure, other operative therapies exist for dealing with severe systolic left ventricular dysfunction. the choice of surgical intervention depends on the etiology and functional characteristics of the patient's ventricular dysfunction. in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, surgical revascularization improves survival. patients with mitral regurgitation experience significant functional improvement from mitral valve repair and replacement. in patients with aortic valve dysfunction, aortic valve replacement results in improved survival and functional status. although surgical ventricular reconstruction is controversial, significant data exist suggesting that it is an effective therapy in a subset of patients with left ventricular dysfunction. finally, passive restraint devices are effective at halting further ventricular dilation. although cardiac surgery in patients with severe ventricular dysfunction can be complicated by significant morbidity and mortality, experienced centers have demonstrated acceptable outcomes in carefully selected patients.  objectives the purpose of this study was to compare postoperative outcome in two groups of patients with chronic severe aortic regurgitation (ar): those operated on early and those operated on late according to the guidelines.   background the impact of earlier surgery for chronic severe ar as defined in guidelines has not been evaluated.   methods a total of 170 patients with chronic severe ar submitted to aortic valve replacement were prospectively followed up. patients were divided in two groups depending on the clinical situation at the time of surgery. group a were 60 patients who were operated on following guidelines advice of earlier surgery, and group b were 110 patients who were operated on late with regard to guideline recommendations.   results follow-up was 10 +/- 6 years (1 to 22 years). during follow-up 44 patients died, 7 patients (12%) from group a and 37 (37%) from group b (p = 0.001). the cause of death was non-cardiac in 11 patients, 2 (3%) in group a and 9 (8%) in group b. cardiac deaths occurred in 33 patients, 5 (9%) from group a and 28 (28%) from group b (p = 0.002). causes of death differed between groups a and b: heart failure or sudden death were significantly more frequent in group b (20 patients vs. 1 patient, p = 0.001). overall survival in groups a and b was 90 +/- 4% vs. 75 +/- 8% at 5 years, 86 +/- 5% vs. 64 +/- 5% at 10 years, and 78 +/- 7% vs. 53 +/- 6% at 15 years, respectively (p = 0.009).   conclusions early operation as defined in the guidelines improves long-term survival in patients with chronic ar.
backgroundcancer therapy in malaysia primarily focuses on the clinical management of patients with cancer and malnutrition continues to be one of the major causes of death in these patients. there is a dearth of information on the nutrient intake and status of newly diagnosed patients with cancer prior to the initiation of treatment. the present study aims to assess the nutrient intake and status of newly diagnosed patients with cancer from the east coast of peninsular malaysia.methodsa cross-sectional study was conducted using a convenient sample of newly diagnosed adult patients with cancer (n = 70) attending the oncology clinic, hospital universiti sains malaysia in the east coast of peninsular malaysia. information on socio-demographic characteristics, clinical status, anthropometry, dietary intake and biochemical data including blood samples was obtained.resultsthe mean (sd) age, triceps skin fold (tsf), mid upper arm circumference (muac) and body mass index (bmi) of participants was 21.1(3.9) years, 17.6(7.9) mm, 24.1(5.5) cm, and 21.1(3.9) kg/m2, respectively; 39% participants had bmi <18.5 kg/m2. one-third of newly diagnosed patients with cancer were undernourished (i.e. women: muac <220 mm; men: <230 mm). the proportion (%) of participants with low haemoglobin (<120 g/l) and serum albumin (<38 g/dl) were 62% and 26%, respectively. the older women had significantly lower macro and micro nutrient intakes compared to men in the same age group (p <0.05).conclusionsat the time of diagnosis, greater than one-third of patients with cancer from the east coast of peninsular malaysia were underweight and undernourished. the majority of patients with cancer had poor micronutrient intakes; the older women had a poor macro and micronutrient intakes. before the initiation of rigorous clinical management of patients with cancer, screening for nutritional status, subsequent nutrition counseling, and interventions are essential to improve their nutritional status; consequently, response to cancer therapy, survival and quality of life.  arm muscle area (ama, cm2) is currently calculated from triceps skinfold thickness (tsf, cm), and midarm circumference (mac, cm). in assessing the accuracy of the current equation by comparison to ama measured by computerized axial tomography, error in each of the four approximations made was found to result in a 20 to 25% overestimate of ama. two correctible error sources were: a 10 to 15% overestimation caused by assuming a circular midarm muscle compartment and a 5 to 10% overestimation due to inclusion of midarm cross-sectional bone area. corrected ama equations for men and women were respectively: [(mac - pi x tsf)2/4 pi] - 10, and [mac - pi x tsf)2/4 pip] - 6.5. with two additional study groups, the overall improved accuracy of the new equations was confirmed, although the average error for a given patient was 7 to 8%; the relationship between corrected ama and total body muscle mass was established [muscle mass (kg) = (ht, cm2) (0.0264 + 0.0029 x corrected ama)]; and the minimal range of corrected ama values compatible with survival (9 to 11 cm2) was defined. bedside estimates of undernutrition severity and prognosis can therefore be calculated from two simple measurements, tsf and mac.
backgroundalthough a genetic component has been identified as a risk factor for developing inflammatory bowel disease, there is evidence that dietary factors also play a role in the development of this disease.aimsthe aim of this study was to determine the effects of feeding a red meat diet with and without resistant starch (rs) to mice with dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis.methodscolonic experimental colitis was induced in balb/c mice using dss. the severity of colitis was evaluated based on a disease activity index (based on bodyweight loss, stool consistency, rectal bleeding, and overall condition of the animal) and a histological score. estimations were made of numbers of a range of different bacteria in the treatment pools of cecal digesta using quantitative real-time pcr.resultsconsumption of a diet high in red meat increased dss-induced colitis as evidenced by higher disease activity and histopathological scores. addition of rs to the red meat diet exerted a beneficial effect in acute dss-induced colitis. subjective analysis of numbers of a range of bacterial targets suggest changes in the gut microbiota abundance were induced by red meat and rs treatments and these changes could contribute to the reported outcomes.conclusionsa dietary intake of red meat aggravates dss-induced colitis whereas co-consumption of resistant starch reduces the severity of colitis.  background: we have previously demonstrated that inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase (dp) activity partially attenuates dextran sulfate sodium (dss) colitis in mice. the aim of this study was to further investigate the mechanisms of this protection. materials and methods: wildtype (wt) and dpiv−/− mice consumed 2% dss in drinking water for 6 days to induce colitis. mice were treated with saline or the dp inhibitors ile‐pyrr‐(2‐cn)*tfa or ile‐thia. dp mrna and enzyme levels were measured in the colon. glucagon‐like peptide (glp)‐2 and glp‐1 concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay, regulatory t‐cells (tregs) by fluorescence activated cell sorting (facs) on foxp3+t cells in blood, and neutrophil infiltration assessed by myeloperoxidase (mpo) assay. results: dp8 and dp2 mrna levels were increased (p < 0.05) in wt+saline mice compared to untreated wt mice with colitis. cytoplasmic dp enzyme activity was increased (p < 0.05) in dpiv−/− mice at day 6 of dss, while dp2 activity was increased (p < 0.05) in wt mice with colitis. glp‐1 (63%) and glp‐2 (50%) concentrations increased in wt+ile‐pyrr‐(2‐cn)*tfa mice compared to day‐0 controls. mpo activity was lower in wt+ile‐thia and wt+ile‐pyrr‐(2‐cn)*tfa treated mice compared to wt+saline (p < 0.001) at day 6 colitis. conclusions: dp expression and activity are differentially regulated during dss colitis, suggesting a pathophysiological role for these enzymes in human inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). dp inhibitors impaired neutrophil recruitment and maintenance of the treg population during dss‐colitis, providing further preclinical evidence for the potential therapeutic use of these inhibitors in ibd. finally, dpiv appears to play a critical role in mediating the protective effect of dp inhibitors. inflamm bowel dis 2010
the reservoir for neisseria meningitidis (nm) is the human oropharynx. implementation of nm serogroup c (nmc) glycoconjugate vaccines directly reduced nmc carriage. prophylactic vaccines are now available to prevent disease caused by the five major nm disease causing serogroups (abcwy). nm serogroup b (nmb) vaccines are composed of antigens that are conserved across nm serogroups and therefore have the potential to impact all nm carriage. to assess the effect of these vaccines on carriage, standardized approaches to identify and group nm are required. real-time pcr (rt-pcr) capsule grouping assays that were internally controlled to confirm nm species were developed for eight serogroups associated with carriage (a, b, c, e, w, x, y and z). the grouping scheme was validated using diverse bacterial species associated with carriage and then used to evaluate a collection of diverse nm carriage isolates (n=234). a scheme that also included pora and ctra probes was able to speciate the isolates, while ctra also provided insights on the integrity of the polysaccharide loci. isolates were typed for the nm vaccine antigen factor h binding protein (fhbp), and were found to represent the known diversity of this antigen. the pora rt-pcr yielded positive results with all 234 of the nm carriage isolates. genogrouping assays classified 76.5% (179/234) of these isolates to a group, categorized 53 as nongenogroupable (ngg) and two as mixed results. thirty seven ngg isolates evidenced a disrupted capsular polysaccharide operon judged by a ctra negative result. only 28.6% (67/234) of the isolates were serogrouped by slide agglutination (sasg), highlighting the reduced capability of carriage strains to express capsular polysaccharide. these rt-pcr assays provide a comprehensive means to identify and genogroup n. meningitidis in carriage studies used to guide vaccination strategies and to assess the impact of novel fhbp containing vaccines on meningococcal carriage.  background in 1999, meningococcal serogroup c conjugate (mcc) vaccines were introduced in the united kingdom for those under 19 years of age. the impact of this intervention on asymptomatic carriage of meningococci was investigated to establish whether serogroup replacement or protection by herd immunity occurred.   methods multicenter surveys of carriage were conducted during vaccine introduction and on 2 successive years, resulting in a total of 48,309 samples, from which 8599 meningococci were isolated and characterized by genotyping and phenotyping.   results a reduction in serogroup c carriage (rate ratio, 0.19) was observed that lasted at least 2 years with no evidence of serogroup replacement. vaccine efficacy against carriage was 75%, and vaccination had a disproportionate impact on the carriage of sequence type (st)-11 complex serogroup c meningococci that (rate ratio, 0.06); these meningococci also exhibited high rates of capsule expression.   conclusions the impact of vaccination with mcc vaccine on the prevalence of carriage of group c meningococci was consistent with herd immunity. the high impact on the carriage of st-11 complex serogroup c could be attributed to high levels of capsule expression. high vaccine efficacy against disease in young children, who were not protected long-term by the schedule initially used, is attributed to the high vaccine efficacy against carriage in older age groups.
the objective of this experiment was to investigate the effects of different particle sizes, expressed as geometric mean diameter (gmd) of corn (0.336mm, 0.585mm, 0.856mm and 1.12mm) of mash and pelleted broiler chicken diets on the weight of the gizzard, duodenum and jejunum+ileum; on the ph of the gizzard and small intestine and on the characteristics of the duodenal mucous layer (number and height of villi and crypt depth) in 42-day-old broilers. the physical form and the particle size of the diet had no significant effect on gizzard and intestine ph (p > 0.05). a greater gizzard weight was seen in the birds receiving pelleted diet and particle size of 0.336mm (p < 0.008). however, for the particle sizes of 0.856 and 1.12 mm, a greater weight was found in birds that received mash diet (p < 0.039 and p < 0.006, respectively). also, gizzard weight was greater with increasing corn gmd independent of the physical form of the diet. in the mash diet, the increase in particle size promoted a quadratic response in the weight of duodenum and jejunum + ileum. the pelleted diet promoted a greater number of villi per transverse duodenum cut (p < 0.007) and greater crypt depth (p < 0.05). as the particle size increased, there was a linear increase of villus height and crypt depth in the duodenum, irrespective of the physical form of the diet.  diets were prepared with corn, wheat, or sorghum ground in a hammer mill and sieved to obtain coarse, medium, and fine particle size fractions. their effect on broiler performance from hatch to 7 d and from 7 to 21 d of age was studied. the effect of particle size on the size and ph of the gastrointestinal organs was also determined. the three textures obtained for each grain were uniform in geometric mean diameter (gmd) and geometric standard deviation (gsd). grain by texture interactions were not significant. independent of grain source, the best performance was obtained with diets prepared from the medium texture. in these diets, the gmd of the grains varied from 1.13 to 1.23 mm and the gsd from 1.19 to 1.35. the fine fraction (gmd .57 to .67 mm) resulted in the lowest performance and that resulting from the coarse fraction (gmd 2.01 to 2.10 mm) was intermediate. at 7 and 21 d of age, gizzard weight and content were positively related to particle size. at the age of 21 d, duodenum weight and content was highest in chicks fed the fine diets. the ph of the gizzard content decreased with increasing grain particle size, whereas that of the small intestinal content increased. some grain effects were also observed on the gastrointestinal tract. gizzard weight was greatest in the cornfed birds. wheat-fed chicks had the heavier intestines and contents. after overnight feed deprivation, feed consumption by 7-d-old chicks was related to the particle size during the first 2 h of refeeding, with greater intake of medium and coarse grains.
the social environment has potent effects on individual phenotype and fitness in group-living species. we asked whether the presence of kin might act on energy allocation, a central aspect of life-history variation. using a 22-year data set on reproductive and somatic allocations in columbian ground squirrels (urocitellus columbianus), we tested the effects of co-breeding and non-breeding kin on the fitness and energy allocation balance between reproduction and personal body condition of individual females. greater numbers of co-breeding kin had a positive effect on the number of offspring weaned, through the mechanism of altering energy allocation patterns. on average, females with higher numbers of co-breeding kin did not increase energy income but biased energy allocation towards reproduction. co-breeding female kin ground squirrels maintain close nest burrows, likely providing a social buffer against territorial invasions from non-kin ground squirrels. lower aggressiveness, lower risks of infanticide from female kin and greater protection of territorial boundaries may allow individual females to derive net fitness benefits via their energy allocation strategies. we demonstrated the importance of kin effects on a fundamental life-history trade-off.  since w. d. hamilton's seminal work on the evolution of sociality, a large body of research has accumulated on how kin selection might explain the evolution of cooperation in many group-living species. our study examined the evolutionary basis of philopatry and cooperation; specifically, whether individuals benefit from the presence of close kin. we applied an individual fitness approach to a 16-year study of columbian ground squirrels (urocitellus columbianus) to investigate potential causal paths by which the presence of kin might act on individual fitness. our results indicate that individual fitness benefits resulted from associations of philopatric female kin, and support the hypothesis that increased tolerance of proximity of kin is a proximate mechanism for these benefits. the major life-history influence of kin on individual fitness was through improved reproductive success, and this benefit may have been owing to philopatric settlement of kin that were recognized through familiarization in the natal burrow. thus, we demonstrated an evolutionary basis necessary for ongoing kin-selected cooperation in columbian ground squirrels, though the mechanism of familiarity may determine which kin individuals benefit from cooperative behaviours.
transcriptional gene silencing (tgs) of the endogenous gbssi promoter in potato was induced by inverted repeat constructs containing different regions of the gbssi promoter. clear differences in silencing efficiency were observed. the 35sgbp-ir construct, containing sequences from −766 to −168 bp relative to the transcription initiation site (tis), induced weak silencing effects in 57–60% of the transformants. weak silencing effects were also induced by the asp-ir construct harbouring allele-specific sequences covering the region from −531 to −330 bp relative to the tis, but only in a low percentage (4–5.5%) of the transformants. these percentages are too low to distinguish effects between the two potato cultivars. therefore, this approach cannot be used to induce allele-specific tgs. strong silencing effects were obtained in 49% of the transformants harbouring the full promoter inverted repeat construct. this construct contained sequences from −766 to +194 bp relative to the tis. in the strongly silenced transformants no gbssi mrna could be detected by northern blot analysis. this was accompanied by the accumulation of gbssi promoter-specific small interfering rnas. methylation studies revealed that, in the weakly silenced 35sgbp-ir transformants, the hpaii site at −213 bp relative to the tis was methylated. apparently, methylation of this sequence does not result in strong silencing effects. in the full promoter transformants, both cg methylation and cnn methylation were detected. we show that, to obtain strong tgs, it is important to include sequences in the vicinity of the tis.  two distinct gene-silencing phenomena are observed in plants: transcriptional gene silencing (tgs), which involves decreased rna synthesis because of promoter methylation, and posttranscriptional gene silencing (ptgs), which involves sequence-specific rna degradation. ptgs is induced by deliberate [1-4] or fortuitous production (r.v.b., unpublished data) of double-stranded rna (dsrna). tgs could be the result of dna pairing [5], but could also be the result of dsrna, as was shown by the dsrna-induced inactivation of a transgenic promoter [6]. here, we show that when targeting flower pigmentation genes in petunia, transgenes expressing dsrna can induce ptgs when coding sequences are used and tgs when promoter sequences are taken. for both types of silencing, small rna species are found, which are thought to be dsrna decay products [7] and determine the sequence specificity of the silencing process [8, 9]. furthermore, silencing is accompanied by the methylation of dna sequences that are homologous to dsrna. dna methylation is assumed to be essential for regulating tgs and important for reinforcing ptgs [10]. therefore, we conclude that tgs and ptgs are mechanistically related. in addition, we show that dsrna-induced tgs provides an efficient tool to generate gene knockouts, because not only does the tgs of a ptgs-inducing transgene fully revert the ptgs phenotype, but also an endogenous gene can be transcriptionally silenced by dsrna corresponding to its promoter.
the hedgehog (hh) signaling pathway initiates an evolutionarily conserved developmental program required for the proper patterning of many tissues [1]. although costal2 (cos2) is a requisite component of the hh pathway, its mechanistic role is not well understood. because of its primary sequence, cos2 was initially predicted to function as a kinesin-like protein [2]. however, evidence showing that cos2 function might require kinesin-like properties has been lacking [2-6]. thus, the prevailing dogma in the field is that cos2 functions solely as a scaffolding protein [7, 8]. here, we show that cos2 motility is required for its biological function and that this motility may be hh regulated. we show that cos2 motility requires an active motor domain, atp, and microtubules. additionally, cos2 recruits and transports other components of the hh signaling pathway, including the transcription factor cubitus interruptus (ci). drosophila expressing cos2 mutations that encode proteins that lack motility are attenuated in their ability to regulate ci activity and exhibit phenotypes consistent with attenuated cos2 function [9]. combined, these results demonstrate that cos2 motility plays an important role in its function, regulating the amounts and activity of ci that ultimately interpret the level of hh to which cells are exposed.  axoplasm from the squid giant axon contains a soluble protein translocator that induces movement of microtubules on glass, latex beads on microtubules, and axoplasmic organelles on microtubules. we now report the partial purification of a protein from squid giant axons and optic lobes that induces these microtubule-based movements and show that there is a homologous protein in bovine brain. the purification of the translocator protein depended primarily on its unusual property of forming a high affinity complex with microtubules in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable atp analog, adenylyl imidodiphosphate. the protein, once released from microtubules with atp, migrates on gel filtration columns with an apparent molecular weight of 600 kilodaltons and contains 110-120 and 60-70 kilodalton polypeptides. this protein is distinct in molecular weight and enzymatic behavior from myosin or dynein, which suggests that it belongs to a novel class of force-generating molecules, for which we propose the name kinesin.
meta-schedulers map jobs to computational resources that are part of a grid, such as clusters, that in turn have their own local job schedulers. existing grid meta-schedulers either target system-centric metrics, such as utilisation and throughput, or prioritise jobs based on utility metrics provided by the users. the system-centric approach gives less importance to users' individual utility, while the user-centric approach may have adverse effects such as poor system performance and unfair treatment of users. therefore, this paper proposes a novel meta-scheduler, based on the well-known double auction mechanism that aims to satisfy users' service requirements as well as ensuring balanced utilisation of resources across a grid. we have designed valuation metrics that commodify both the complex resource requirements of users and the capabilities of available computational resources. through simulation using real traces, we compare our scheduling mechanism with other common mechanisms widely used by both existing market-based and traditional meta-schedulers. the results show that our meta-scheduling mechanism not only satisfies up to 15% more user requirements than others, but also improves system utilisation through load balancing.  many research and engineering fields, like bioinformatics or particle physics, are confident about the development of grid technologies to provide the huge amounts of computational and storage resources they require. although several projects are working on creating a reliable infrastructure consisting of persistent resources and services, the truth is that the grid will be a more and more dynamic entity as it grows. in this paper, we present a new tool that hides the complexity and dynamicity of the grid from developers and users, allowing the resolution of large computational experiments in a grid environment by adapting the scheduling and execution of jobs to the changing grid conditions and application dynamic demands.
abstract the elastoplastic constitutive analysis which utilizes the model of multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into its elastic and plastic parts has been mainly developed and applied to elastically isotropic materials, which remain isotropic during the process of plastic deformation. this paper extends the application of the model to materials that change their elastic properties during the deformation process as a result of the material degradation and the corresponding damage. the exact kinematic and kinetic analysis of the finite deformations leads to an additive decomposition of the total strain rate into its elastic, damage and plastic constituents. the general structure of the expression for the damage strain rate is derived, valid for utilized damage tensors of any order. the analysis of elastoplastic deformation of elastically anisotropic materials without damage is also presented, with the application to transversely isotropic materials. the relationships between the elastic and plastic strain rates and the components of the multiplicative decomposition and their rates are also given.  in this paper a scalar-valued isotropic tensor function is considered, the variables of which are constitutive tensors of orders two and four, for instance, characterizing the anisotropic properties of a material. therefore, the system of irreducible invariants of a fourth-order tensor is constructed. furthermore, the joint or simultaneous invariants of a second-order and a fourth-order tensor are found. in a similar way one can construct an integrity basis for a tensor of order greater than four, as shown in the paper, for instance, for a tensor of order six.
brain function is shaped by postnatal experience and vulnerable to disruption of methyl-cpg-binding protein, mecp2, in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. how mecp2 contributes to the experience-dependent refinement of specific cortical circuits and their impairment remains unknown. we analyzed vision in gene-targeted mice and observed an initial normal development in the absence of mecp2. visual acuity then rapidly regressed after postnatal day p35-40 and cortical circuits largely fell silent by p55-60. enhanced inhibitory gating and an excess of parvalbumin-positive, perisomatic input preceded the loss of vision. both cortical function and inhibitory hyperconnectivity were strikingly rescued independent of mecp2 by early sensory deprivation or genetic deletion of the excitatory nmda receptor subunit, nr2a. thus, vision is a sensitive biomarker of progressive cortical dysfunction and may guide novel, circuit-based therapies for mecp2 deficiency.  motor and cognitive functions are severely impaired in rett syndrome (rtt). here, we examined local synaptic circuits of layer 2/3 (l2/3) pyramidal neurons in motor-frontal cortex of male hemizygous mecp2-null mice at 3 to 4weeks of age. we mapped local excitatory input to l2/3 neurons using glutamate uncaging and laser scanning photostimulation, and compared synaptic input maps recorded from mecp2-null and wild type (wt) mice. local excitatory input was significantly reduced in the mutants. the strongest phenotype was observed for lateral (horizontal, intralaminar) inputs, that is, l2/3-->2/3 inputs, which showed a large reduction in mecp2(-/y) animals. neither the amount of local inhibitory input to these l2/3 pyramidal neurons nor their intrinsic electrophysiological properties differed by genotype. our findings provide further evidence that excitatory networks are selectively reduced in rtt. we discuss our findings in the context of recently published parallel studies using selective mecp2 knockdown in individual l2/3 neurons.
background cancer-related fatigue (crf) is a common symptom affecting patients with cancer. there are an increasing number of trials examining potential treatments for crf. methylphenidate represents one of the most researched drugs and an up-to-date assessment of the evidence for its use is needed. trials of methylphenidate for crf provided inconsistent results. this meta-analysis was aimed at assessing the effect and safety of methylphenidate on crf. methods we comprehensively searched the pubmed, embase, psychinfo and the cochrane databases in order to identify published studies on the effect of methylphenidate on crf. primary outcomes included fatigue. secondary outcomes included depression, cognition and adverse effects. findings a meta-analysis was conducted on five randomized controlled trials and 498 patients were enrolled. despite a large placebo effect observed in the studies included, pooled data suggested therapeutic effect of methylphenidate on crf. subgroup analyses showed that the efficacy of methylphenidate on crf is getting better with prolonging treatment duration, with a md of −3.70 (95% ci −7.03– −0.37, p = 0.03) for long-time group and a md of −2.49 (95% ci −6.01–1.03, p = 0.17) for short-time group. in general, there was no impact of methylphenidate on depression and cognition associated with crf. adverse events were similar between methylphenidate and placebo groups except that more patients reported vertigo, anxiety, anorexia and nausea in methylphenidate group compared to placebo group. conclusion existing trials of methylphenidate on crf provided limited evidence for the use of methylphenidate to treat crf. the absolute numbers still remain small, and further confirmation is needed before firm recommendations on their usage and safety can be made in the treatment of crf.  abstract attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) often persists into adulthood. stimulant drugs, including methylphenidate, have showed efficacy in trials for adhd in adults. adult psychiatrists are likely to encounter increasing numbers of adult patients who may benefit from methylphenidate. a systematic review of the literature was made to examine the evidence on the safety of methylphenidate, when used therapeutically in adults. twenty-six placebo-controlled trials were found, in which 811 adults received methylphenidate for adhd and other conditions. in the short term, methylphenidate was well tolerated and no serious side effects were observed. there is little information on the long-term safety of methylphenidate in adults, although the number of serious adverse effects reported to regulatory authorities has, so far, been low. methylphenidate is associated with a modest rise in blood pressure and heart rate. surveys of stimulant use in us universities show that misuse of prescribed medication, for recreation or to enhance study, is fairly common although the level of harm that arises from this practice is unclear.
this study investigated the effects of a 16-h protocol of heavy intermittent exercise on the intrinsic activity and protein and isoform content of skeletal muscle na(+)-k(+)-atpase. the protocol consisted of 6 min of exercise performed once per hour at approximately 91% peak aerobic power (vo(2 peak)) with tissue sampling from vastus lateralis before (b) and immediately after repetitions 1 (r1), 2 (r2), 9 (r9), and 16 (r16). eleven untrained volunteers with a vo(2 peak) of 44.3 +/- 2.3 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) participated in the study. maximal na(+)-k(+)-atpase activity (v(max), in nmol x mg protein(-1) x h(-1)) as measured by the 3-o-methylfluorescein k(+)-stimulated phosphatase assay was reduced (p < 0.05) by approximately 15% with exercise regardless of the number of repetitions performed. in addition, v(max) at r9 and r16 was lower (p < 0.05) than at r1 and r2. vanadate-facilitated [(3)h]ouabain determination of na(+)-k(+)-atpase content (maximum binding capacity, pmol/g wet wt), although unaltered by exercise, increased (p < 0.05) 8.3% by r9 with no further increase observed at r16. assessment of relative changes in isoform abundance measured at b as determined by quantitative immunoblotting showed a 26% increase (p < 0.05) in the alpha(2)-isoform by r2 and a 29% increase in alpha(3) by r9. at r16, beta(3) was lower (p < 0.05) than at r2 and r9. no changes were observed in alpha(1), beta(1), or beta(2). it is concluded that repeated sessions of heavy exercise, although resulting in increases in the alpha(2)- and alpha(3)-isoforms and decreases in beta(3)-isoform, also result in depression in maximal catalytic activity.  the purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that a single, extended session of heavy exercise would be effective in inducing adaptations in energy metabolism during exercise in the absence of increases in oxidative potential. ten healthy males [maximal aerobic power (vo(2 peak)) = 43.4 +/- 2.2 (se) ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)] participated in a 16-h training session involving cycling for 6 min each hour at approximately 90% of maximal oxygen consumption. measurements of metabolic changes were made on tissue extracted from the vastus lateralis during a two-stage standardized submaximal cycle protocol before (pre) and 36-48 h after (post) the training session. at pre, creatine phosphate (pcr) declined (p < 0.05) by 32% from 0 to 3 min and then remained stable until 20 min of exercise at 60% vo(2 peak) before declining (p < 0.05) by a further 35% during 20 min of exercise at 75% vo(2 peak). muscle lactate (mmol/kg dry wt) progressively increased (p < 0.05) from 4.59 +/- 0.64 at 0 min to 17.8 +/- 2.7 and 30.9 +/- 5.3 at 3 and 40 min, respectively, whereas muscle glycogen (mmol glucosyl units/kg dry wt) declined (p < 0.05) from a rest value of 360 +/- 24 to 276 +/- 31 and 178 +/- 36 at similar time points. during exercise after the training session, pcr and glycogen were not as depressed (p < 0.05), and increases in muscle lactate were blunted (p < 0.05). all of these changes occurred in the absence of increases in oxidative potential as measured by the maximal activities of citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase. these findings are consistent with other studies, namely, that muscle metabolic adaptations to regular exercise are an early adaptive event that occurs before increases in oxidative potential.
the objective of foreground segmentation is to extract the desired foreground object from input videos. over the years there have been significant amount of efforts on this topic, nevertheless there still lacks a simple yet effective algorithm that can process live videos of objects with fuzzy boundaries captured by freely moving cameras. this paper presents an algorithm toward this goal. the key idea is to train and maintain two competing one-class support vector machines (1svms) at each pixel location, which model local color distributions for foreground and background, respectively. we advocate the usage of two competing local classifiers, as it provides higher discriminative power and allows better handling of ambiguities. as a result, our algorithm can deal with a variety of videos with complex backgrounds and freely moving cameras with minimum user interactions. in addition, by introducing novel acceleration techniques and by exploiting the parallel structure of the algorithm, realtime processing speed is achieved for vga-sized videos.  this paper examines the problem of moving object detection. more precisely, it addresses the difficult scenarios where background scene textures in the video might change over time. in this paper, we formulate the problem mathematically as minimizing a constrained risk functional motivated from the large margin principle. it is a generalization of the one class support vector machines (1-svms) [17] to accommodate spatial interactions, which is further incorporated into an online learning framework to track temporal changes. as a result it yields a closed-form update formula, a central component of the proposed algorithm to enable prompt adaptation to spatio-temporal changes. we also analyze the mistake bound and discuss issues such as dealing with non-stationary distributions, making use of kernels and efficient inference by a variant of dynamic programming. by exploiting the inherently concurrent structure, the proposed approach is designed to work with the highly parallel graphics processors (gpus) to facilitate realtime analysis. our empirical study demonstrates that the proposed approach works in realtime (over 80 frames per second) and at the same time performs competitively against state-of-the-art offline and quasi-realtime methods.
privacy preservation has recently received considerable attention for location-based mobile services. a lot of location cloaking approaches focus on identity and location protection, but few algorithms pay attention to prevent sensitive information disclosure using query semantics. in terms of personalized privacy requirements, all queries in a cloaking set, from some user’s point of view, are sensitive. these users regard the privacy is breached. this attack is called as the sensitivity homogeneity attack. we show that none of the existing location cloaking approaches can effectively resolve this problem over road networks. we propose a (k, l, p)-anonymity model and a personalized privacy protection cloaking algorithm over road networks, aiming at protecting the identity, location and sensitive information for each user. the main idea of our method is first to partition users into different groups as anonymity requirements. then, unsafe groups are adjusted by inserting relaxed conservative users considering sensitivity requirements. finally, segments covered by each group are published to protect location information. the efficiency and effectiveness of the method are validated by a series of carefully designed experiments. the experimental results also show that the price paid for defending against sensitivity homogeneity attacks is small.  in this paper we discuss a new type of query in spatial databas es, called the trip planning query (tpq). given a set of points of interestp in space, where each point belongs to a specific category, a star ting points and a destinatione, tpq retrieves thebesttrip that starts at s, passes through at least one point from each category, and ends at e. for example, a driver traveling from boston to providence might want to stop to a gas station, a ban k and a post office on his way, and the goal is to provide him with the best possibl e route (in terms of distance, traffic, road conditions, etc.). the difficulty of this query lies in the existence of multiple choices per category. in this paper, w study fast approximation algorithms for tpq in a metric space. we provide a numb er of approximation algorithms with approximation ratios that depend o either the number of categories, the maximum number of points per category or b oth. therefore, for different instances of the problem, we can choose the alg orithm with the best approximation ratio, since they all run in polynomial time. furthermore, we use some of the proposed algorithms to derive efficient heuristi cs for large datasets stored in external memory. finally, we give an experimental ev luation of the proposed algorithms using both synthetic and real datasets .
in maize and other grasses there is a developmental gradient from the meristematic cells at the base of the stalk to the differentiated cells at the leaf tip. this gradient presents an opportunity to investigate changes in mitochondrial dna (mtdna) that accompany growth under light and dark conditions, as done previously for plastid dna. maize mtdna was analyzed by dapi-dna staining of individual mitochondria, gel electrophoresis/blot hybridization, and real-time qpcr. both the amount and integrity of the mtdna were found to decline with development. there was a 20-fold decline in mtdna copy number per cell from the embryo to the light-grown leaf blade. the amount of dna per mitochondrial particle was greater in dark-grown leaf blade (24 copies, on average) than in the light (2 copies), with some mitochondria lacking any detectable dna. three factors that influence the demise of mtdna during development are considered: (1) the decision to either repair or degrade mtdna molecules that are damaged by the reactive oxygen species produced as byproducts of respiration; (2) the generation of atp by photophosphorylation in chloroplasts, reducing the need for respiratory-competent mitochondria; and (3) the shift in mitochondrial function from energy-generating respiration to photorespiration during the transition from non-green to green tissue.  in maize (zea mays l.), chloroplast development progresses from the basal meristem to the mature leaf tip, and light is required for maturation to photosynthetic competence. during chloroplast greening, it was found that chloroplast dna (cpdna) is extensively degraded, falling to undetectable levels in many individual chloroplasts for three maize cultivars, as well as zea mexicana (the ancestor of cultivated maize) and the perennial species zea diploperennis. in dark-grown maize seedlings, the proplastid-to-etioplast transition is characterized by plastid enlargement, cpdna replication, and the retention of high levels of cpdna. when dark-grown seedlings are transferred to white light, the dna content per plastid increases slightly during the first 4 h of illumination and then declines rapidly to a minimum at 24 h during the etioplast-to-chloroplast transition. plastid autofluorescence (from chlorophyll) continues to increase as cpdna declines, whereas plastid size remains constant. it is concluded that the increase in cpdna that accompanies plastid enlargement is a consequence of cell and leaf growth, rather than illumination, whereas light stimulates photosynthetic capacity and cpdna instability. when cpdna from total tissue was monitored by blot hybridization and real-time quantitative pcr, no decline following transfer from dark to light was observed. the lack of agreement between dna per plastid and cpdna per cell may be attributed to nupts (nuclear sequences of plastid origin).
atractolytocestus tenuicollis (li, 1964) xi, wang, wu, gao et nie, 2009 is a monozoic, non-segmented tapeworm of the order caryophyllidea, parasitizing exclusively common carp (cyprinus carpio l.). in the current work, the first molecular data, in particular complete ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (its2) and partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit i (cox1) on a. tenuicollis from niushan lake, wuhan, china, are provided. in order to evaluate molecular interrelationships within atractolytocestus, the data on a. tenuicollis were compared with relevant data on two other congeners, atractolytocestus huronensis and atractolytocestus sagittatus. divergent intragenomic copies (its2 paralogues) were detected in the its2 ribosomal spacer of a. tenuicollis; the same phenomenon has previously been observed also in two other congeners. its2 structure of a. tenuicollis was very similar to that of a. huronensis from slovakia, usa and uk; overall pairwise sequence identity was 91.7–95.2 %. on the other hand, values of sequence identity between a. tenuicollis and a. sagittatus were lower, 69.7–70.9 %. cox1 sequence, analysed in five a. tenuicollis individuals, were 100 % identical and no intraspecific variation was observed. comparison of a. tenuicollis cox1 with respective sequences of two other atractolytocestus species showed that the mitochondrial haplotype found in chinese a. tenuicollis is structurally specific (haplotype 4; ha4) and differs from all so far determined atractolytocestus haplotypes (ha1 and ha2 for a. huronensis; ha3 for a. sagittatus). pairwise sequence identity between a. tenuicollis cox1 haplotype and remaining three haplotypes followed the same pattern as in its2. the nucleotide and amino acide (aa) sequence comparison with a. huronensis ha1 and ha2 revealed higher sequence identity, 90.3–90.8 % (96.9 % in aa), while lower values were achieved between a. tenuicollis haplotype and ha3 of japanese a. sagittatus—75.2 % (81.9 % in aa). the phylogenetic analyses using cox1, its2 and combined cox1 + its2 sequences revealed close genetic interrelationship between a. tenuicollis and a. huronensis. independently of a type of analysis and dna region used, the topology of obtained trees was always identical; a. tenuicollis formed separate clade with a. huronensis forming a closely related sister group.  the following caryophyllidean tapeworms were found in freshwater fishes from japan (species reported from japan for the first time marked with an asterisk): family caryophyllaeidae: paracaryophyllaeus gotoi (motomura, 1927) from misgurnus anguillicaudatus (cantor); archigetes sieboldi leuckart, 1878 from pseudorasbora parva (temminck et schlegel) and sarcocheilichthys variegatus microoculus mori (new hosts); family lytocestidae: *caryophyllaeides ergensi scholz, 1990 from tribolodon hakuensis (günther), t. ezoe okada et ikeda, hemibarbus barbus (temminck et schlegel) and chaenogobius sp. (new hosts); khawia japonensis (yamaguti, 1934) from cyprinus carpio linnaeus; k. sinensis hsü, 1935 from h. barbus (new host) and c. carpio; *k. parva (zmeev, 1936) from carassius auratus langsdorfii valenciennes in cuvier et valenciennes and carassius sp. (new hosts); and *atractolytocestus sagittatus (kulakovskaya et akhmerov, 1962) from c. carpio; family capingentidae: *breviscolex orientalis kulakovskaya, 1962 from h. barbus (new host); and caryophyllidea gen. sp. (probably breviscolex orientalis) from c. carpio. the validity of c. ergensi, originally described from leuciscus leuciscus baicalensis from mongolia, is confirmed on the basis of an evaluation of extensive material from japan. atractolytocestus sagittatus (syn. markevitschia sagittata) is tentatively considered a valid species, differing from the only congener, a. huronensis anthony, 1958, in its considerably greater number of testes.
many species gather in choruses to advertise and search for mates, creating noisy social environments that may impair effective communication. these challenges may be further compounded in mixed-species aggregations, where signals from different species overlap and mate-searching females may perceive heterospecific signals in more attractive relative timing positions. i conducted playback experiments with green treefrogs (hyla cinerea) to test the effects of cross-species call interference on sexual communication and found that the sexes responded differently to conspecific and heterospecific calls. females differentiated between call types and preferentially approached the conspecific call, indicating that they were not negatively affected by cross-species call interference. by contrast, males did not differentiate between conspecific and heterospecific calls irrespective of the presented call type and males avoided call overlap and called shortly after the offset of any interfering call. i suggest that the observed sex difference is a function of the time frames that the individual has to evaluate the call before initiating a behavioral response. slower behavioral responses, like phonotaxis that allows for a repeated sampling of a call during approach, may facilitate finer discrimination. fast behavioral responses, like timing one’s call relative to the call of a rival, may limit processing and result in higher permissiveness. as a result, similar call timing behavior in response to conspecific and heterospecific signals may be an artifact of strong selection for fast and precise call timing in the conspecific context and may essentially trap males into wasting time and energy interacting with heterospecifics.  in many species, males advertise to both male and female audiences. given the asymmetry in fitness costs of recognition errors in response to mating signals for the sexes, usually higher for females than males, males are expected to be more permissive than females in their responses to signals. few studies, however, have investigated such differences and there is no consensus on which sex is more permissive to signal variation. we examined the evoked vocal responses of male tungara frogs, physalaemus pustulosus, to 14 species of heterospecific and ancestral male mating calls to evaluate the influence of call similarity and phylogenetic distance on their responses. we also compared male calling responses to female phonotactic responses to examine the propensity of response errors between the sexes. recognition errors were higher for males than females, as predicted by the different costs associated with recognition errors for each sex. males responded to the calls of most species with mating calls, and produced aggressive calls in response to two other heterospecific/ancestral calls. the responses of males were explained by phylogenetic distance but not by overall call similarity. similarly, females were more likely to show phonotaxis to calls of species and ancestors that were more closely related. therefore, evolutionary history has left a perceptual footprint on the brain of both sexes but the details seem to differ. we discuss proximate reasons underlying sexual differences in receiver permissiveness in tungara frogs and potential factors leading to their evolution.
this study evaluated the implementation of computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy (ccbt) for depression and anxiety in a university health center. students reporting symptoms of depression and/or anxiety were offered ccbt and randomized to a session email reminder or no-reminder condition. participants reported significant symptom and functional improvement after receiving treatment, comparable to outcomes achieved in controlled efficacy trials. however, rates of session completion were low, and reminders did not enhance retention. results suggest that ccbt is a promising intervention in this population, with little attenuation of gains relative to efficacy trials but low levels of treatment completion.  objective while considerable attention has focused on improving the detection of depression, assessment of severity is also important in guiding treatment decisions. therefore, we examined the validity of a brief, new measure of depression severity.   measurements the patient health questionnaire (phq) is a self-administered version of the prime-md diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. the phq-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 dsm-iv criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). the phq-9 was completed by 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics. construct validity was assessed using the 20-item short-form general health survey, self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. criterion validity was assessed against an independent structured mental health professional (mhp) interview in a sample of 580 patients.   results as phq-9 depression severity increased, there was a substantial decrease in functional status on all 6 sf-20 subscales. also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and health care utilization increased. using the mhp reinterview as the criterion standard, a phq-9 score > or =10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for major depression. phq-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples.   conclusion in addition to making criteria-based diagnoses of depressive disorders, the phq-9 is also a reliable and valid measure of depression severity. these characteristics plus its brevity make the phq-9 a useful clinical and research tool.
purpose: to determine the prevalence of amblyopia and refractive errors among 7 to 12-year-old primary school children in tehran, iran. methods: this population-based cross-sectional study included 2,410 randomly selected students. visual acuity was tested using an e-chart on yang vision tester. refractive errors were measured by photorefractometry and cycloautorefraction. strabismus was checked using cover test. direct ophthalmoscopy was used to assess the anterior segment, lens opacities, red reflex and fundus. functional amblyopia was defined as best corrected visual acuity ≤20/40 in one or both eyes with no anatomical problems. results: amblyopia was present in 2.3% (95% ci: 1.8% to 2.9%) of participants with no difference between the genders. amblyopic subjects were significantly younger than non-amblyopic children (p=0.004). overall, 15.9% of hyperopic and 5.9% of myopic cases had amblyopia. the prevalence of hyperopia ≥+2.00d, myopia ≤-0.50d, astigmatism ≥0.75d, and anisometropia (≥1.00d) was 3.5%, 4.9%, 22.6%, and 3.9%, respectively. with increasing age, the prevalence of myopia increased (p<0.001), that of hyperopia decreased (p=0.007), but astigmatism showed no change. strabismus was found in 2.3% of cases. strabismus (or=17.9) and refractive errors, especially anisometropia (or=12.87) and hyperopia (or=11.87), were important amblyogenic risk factors. conclusion: the high prevalence of amblyopia in our subjects in comparison to developed countries reveals the necessity of timely and sensitive screening methods. due to the high prevalence of amblyopia among children with refractive errors, particularly high hyperopia and anisometropia, provision of glasses should be specifically attended by parents and supported by the ministry of health and insurance organizations.  purpose. to determine the prevalence of amblyopia, strabismus, and refractive errors in children entering school. methods. in this cross-sectional population-based study, 6-year-old children enrolling in shahrood schools were randomly sampled. those with organic blindness or mental retardation were excluded. ocular alignment, visual acuity, stereopsis, cover testing, and cycloplegic refraction were recorded for all children by an optometrist. a diagnosis of amblyopia was based on a best-corrected visual acuity of 6/12 or less in one or both eyes, or a bilateral difference of at least two best-corrected visual acuity lines. results. a total of 902 children were invited for optometry examinations, among which 827 (91.7%) responded and 815 children (98.5%) were included in the study. the prevalence of significantly reduced visual acuity (uncorrected va ≤6/12 in either eye) and amblyopia was 3.6 and 1.7%, respectively. the prevalence of hyperopia (+2.00 d or worse), myopia (−0.50 d or worse), astigmatism (0.75 d or worse), and anisometropia (1.00 d or more) were 20.5, 1.7, 19.6, and 2.2%, respectively. significant refractive error, defined as hyperopia >+3.50 d, myopia >−3.00 d, astigmatism >1.50 d in the orthogonal meridian or >1.00 d in the oblique meridian, or anisometropia (hyperopic >1.00 d, myopic >3.00 d) was detected in 2.1, 0.1, 5.0, and 0.9% of the sample, respectively. strabismus was diagnosed in 1.2% of children. overall, 52 children (6.4%; 95% confidence interval [ci], 4.7–8.1%) were at risk of amblyopia; of these, 81% had significant refractive errors, 11% had strabismus, and 8% had both. conclusion. a considerable proportion of 6-year-old children have strabismus and/or significant, potentially amblyogenic refractive errors. the relatively high rate of hyperopia and astigmatism in the studied population needs more attention. the results of the study emphasize the need for adequate diagnostic and therapeutic eye care services for preschool children.
the present experiment examined the effects of varying stimulus disparity and relative punisher frequencies on signal detection by humans. participants were placed into one of two groups. group 3 participants were presented with 1:3 and 3:1 punisher frequency ratios, while group 11 participants were presented with 1:11 and 11:1 punisher frequency ratios. for both groups, stimulus disparity was varied across three levels (low, medium, high) for each punisher ratio. in all conditions, correct responses were intermittently reinforced (1:1 reinforcer frequency ratio). participants were mostly biased away from the more punished alternative, with more extreme response biases found for group 11 participants compared to group 3. for both groups, estimates of discriminability increased systematically across the three disparity levels and were unaffected by the punisher ratios. likewise, estimates of response bias and sensitivity to the punisher ratios were unaffected by changes in discriminability, supporting the assumption of parameter invariance in the davison and tustin (1978) model of signal detection. overall, the present experiment found no relation between stimulus control and punisher control, and provided further evidence for similar but opposite effects of punishers to reinforcers in signal-detection procedures.  three experiments using human participants varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers or point-loss punishers in two-alternative signal-detection procedures. experiment 1 varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers for correct responses (group a) and point-loss punishers for errors (group b) across conditions. response bias varied systematically as a function of the relative reinforcer or punisher frequencies. experiment 2 arranged two conditions - one where an unequal ratio of reinforcement (5ratio1 or 1ratio5) was presented without punishment (r-only), and another where the same reinforcer ratio was presented with an equal distribution of point-loss punishers (r+p). response bias was significantly greater in the r-only condition than the r+p condition, supporting a subtractive model of punishment. experiment 3 varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers for correct responses across four unequal reinforcer ratios (5ratio1, 2ratio1, 1ratio2, 1ratio5) both without (r-only) and with (r+p) an equal distribution of point-loss punishers for errors. response bias varied systematically with changes in relative reinforcer frequency for both r-only and r+p conditions, with 5 out of 8 participants showing increases in sensitivity estimates from r-only to r+p conditions. overall, the results indicated that punishers have similar but opposite effects to reinforcers in detection procedures and that combined reinforcer and punisher effects might be better modeled by a subtractive punishment model than an additive punishment model, consistent with research using concurrent-schedule choice procedures.
the small gtpase rap1 and the actin-junctional linker protein canoe/afadin are essential for the initial establishment of polarity in drosophila, acting upstream of bazooka/par3 and the adherens junctions. however, feedback and cross-regulation occur, so polarity establishment is regulated by a network of proteins rather than a linear pathway.  regulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction is essential for the normal physiology of metazoans and is important in many diseases. integrin adhesion receptors can rapidly increase their affinity (integrin activation) in response to intracellular signaling events in a process termed inside-out signaling. the transmembrane domains of integrins and their interactions with the membrane are important in inside-out signaling. moreover, integrin activation is tightly regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways. here, we review recent progress in understanding how the membrane environment can, in cooperation with integrin-binding proteins, regulate integrin activation.
background: practicing fasting during ramadan by pregnant women might be risky. controversies still exist about the nature and the magnitude of metabolic changes in healthy pregnant women who practice fasting. objectives: to systematically review literature pertaining to the practice of ramadan fasting and the effect of fasting on maternal health. methods: relevant literature was obtained through searches of pubmed, and cochran's. incidence and duration of fasting, reasons for non - fasting, dietary changes, physical activity, weight changes, symptoms with fasting, and metabolic parameters for healthy pregnant women who fasted during ramadan were extracted. synthesis of data was performed when appropriate.  objectiveto determine the effects of fasting during the month of ramadan on fetal development and maternal serum cortisol and lipid profile.methodsthis study was performed in obstetrics and gynecology department of gaziantep university hospital, between 23 september 2006 and 23 october 2006 (during the month of ramadan). thirty-six consecutive healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of 20 weeks or more, who were fasting during ramadan, were included in the study group (group 1). the control group (group 2) consisted of 29 healthy pregnant women, who were not fasting during the study period. for evaluating ramadan’s effect on fetus, doppler ultrasonography was performed on all subjects in the beginning and then once a week until the end of ramadan for the following measurements: increase of fetal biparietal diameter (bpd), increase of fetal femur length (fl), increase of estimated fetal body weight (efbw), fetal biophysical profile (bpp), amniotic fluid index (afi), and umbilical artery systole/diastole (s/d) ratio.maternal serum cortisol, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (ldl), high-density lipoprotein (hdl), very low density lipoprotein (vldl), and ldl/hdl ratio were also evaluated before and after ramadan.resultsno significant difference was found between the two groups for the fetal age, maternal weight gain (kilogram), estimated fetal weight gain (efwg), fetal bpp, afi, and umbilical artery s/d ratio. in the fasting group, the maternal serum cortisol levels on day 20 were significantly higher than the initial levels obtained 1 week prior to ramadan (p < 0.05). although no significant increases were observed in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the fasting group, these increases were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05). ldl and vldl levels showed a non-significant decrease at the end of the ramadan. hdl levels showed a slight increase, but ldl/hdl ratios were significantly decreased in fasting group (p < 0.05).conclusionthe results of this study showed that maternal serum cortisol level was elevated while ldl/hdl ratio were decreased in healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of 20 weeks or more, who were fasting during ramadan. no untoward effect of ramadan was observed on intrauterine fetal development.
methods developed in geochemical modelling combined with recent advances in molecular microbial ecology provide new opportunities to explore how microbial communities are shaped by their chemical surroundings. here, we present a framework for analyses of how chemical energy availability shape chemotrophic microbial communities in hydrothermal systems through an investigation of two geochemically different basalt-hosted hydrothermal systems on the arctic mid-ocean ridge: the soria moria vent field (smvf) and the loki’s castle vent field (lcvf). chemical energy landscapes were evaluated through modelling of the gibbs energy from selected redox reactions under different mixing ratios between seawater and hydrothermal fluids. our models indicate that the sediment-influenced lcvf has a much higher potential for both anaerobic and aerobic methane oxidation, as well as aerobic ammonium and hydrogen oxidation, than the smvf. the modelled energy landscapes were used to develop microbial community composition models, which were compared with community compositions in environmental samples inside or on the exterior of hydrothermal chimneys, as assessed by pyrosequencing of partial 16s rrna genes. we show that modelled microbial communities based solely on thermodynamic considerations can have a high predictive power and provide a framework for analyses of the link between energy availability and microbial community composition.  numerical models are employed to investigate sources of chemical energy for autotrophic microbial metabolism that develop during mixing of oxidized seawater with strongly reduced fluids discharged from ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems on the seafloor. hydrothermal fluids in these systems are highly enriched in h(2) and ch(4) as a result of alteration of ultramafic rocks (serpentinization) in the subsurface. based on the availability of chemical energy sources, inferences are made about the likely metabolic diversity, relative abundance, and spatial distribution of microorganisms within ultramafic-hosted systems. metabolic reactions involving h(2) and ch(4), particularly hydrogen oxidation, methanotrophy, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis, represent the predominant sources of chemical energy during fluid mixing. owing to chemical gradients that develop from fluid mixing, aerobic metabolisms are likely to predominate in low-temperature environments (<20-30 degrees c), while anaerobes will dominate higher-temperature environments. overall, aerobic metabolic reactions can supply up to approximately 7 kj of energy per kilogram of hydrothermal fluid, while anaerobic metabolic reactions can supply about 1 kj, which is sufficient to support a maximum of approximately 120 mg (dry weight) of primary biomass production by aerobic organisms and approximately 20-30 mg biomass by anaerobes. the results indicate that ultramafic-hosted systems are capable of supplying about twice as much chemical energy as analogous deep-sea hydrothermal systems hosted in basaltic rocks.
α2-adrenoceptors (α2ar) lower central sympathetic output and peripheral catecholamine release, and may therefore prevent sympathetic hyperactivity and hypertension. the α2ar are dysfunctional in male spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr). premenopausal females are less hypertensive than males. the purpose of this study was to test if this difference could be explained by functional α2ar in the female shr. a 15-min tyramine-infusion was used to stimulate norepinephrine release through the re-uptake transporter, consequently preventing re-uptake. presynaptic control of vesicular release will therefore be reflected as differences in overflow to plasma. the surgical trauma activates secretion of epinephrine, also subjected to α2ar auto-inhibition. blood pressure was monitored through a femoral artery catheter and cardiac output by ascending aorta flow in 12-14 weeks-old (early hypertension) shr and normotensive rats (wky). total peripheral vascular resistance (tpr) was calculated. female shr, unlike male, were close to normotensive. pre-treatment with none-selective (clonidine) or non-a-selective (st-91) α2ar agonist reduced, and none-selective α2ar antagonist (l-659,066) increased tyramine-induced norepinephrine overflow in female wky and shr. l-659,066 also increased secretion of epinephrine. the l-659,066-induced increase in catecholamine release was further enhanced by additional pre-treatment with st-91 or angiotensin at1 receptor antagonist (losartan) in shr only. l-659,066 eliminated the tyramine-induced rise in tpr in both strains in female rats. conclusion: α2ar-mediated control of catecholamine release and vascular tension was therefore functional in female shr, unlike that previously observed in male shr. functional α2ar is likely to have a protective function and may explain the lack of hypertension in the young female shr.  α2-adrenoceptors (ar) lower central sympathetic output and peripheral catecholamine release, thereby protecting against sympathetic hyperactivity and hypertension. norepinephrine re-uptake–transporter effectively (net) removes norepinephrine from the synapse. overflow to plasma will therefore not reflect release. here we tested if inhibition of re-uptake allowed presynaptic α2ar release control to be reflected as differences in norepinephrine overflow in anesthetized hypertensive spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr) and normotensive rats (wky). we also tested if α2ar modulated the experiment-induced epinephrine secretion, and a phenylephrine-induced, α1-adrenergic vasoconstriction. blood pressure was recorded through a femoral artery catheter, and cardiac output by ascending aorta flow. after pre-treatment with net inhibitor (desipramine), and/or α2ar antagonist (yohimbine, l-659,066) or agonist (clonidine, st-91), we injected phenylephrine. arterial blood was sampled 15 min later. plasma catecholamine concentrations were not influenced by phenylephrine, and therefore reflected effects of pre-treatment. desipramine and α2ar antagonist separately had little effect on norepinephrine overflow. combined, they increased norepinephrine overflow, particularly in shr. clonidine, but not st-91, reduced, and pertussis toxin increased norepinephrine overflow in shr and epinephrine secretion in both strains. l-659,066 + clonidine (central α2ar-stimulation) normalized the high blood pressure, heart rate, and vascular tension in shr. α2ar antagonists reduced phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction equally in wky and shr. conclusions: α2aar inhibition increased norepinephrine overflow only when re-uptake was blocked, and then with particular efficacy in shr, possibly due to their high sympathetic tone. α2aar inhibited epinephrine secretion, particularly in shr. α2aar supported α1ar-induced vasoconstriction equally in the two strains. α2ar malfunctions were therefore not detected in shr under this basal condition.
metastatic breast cancer remains the chief cause of cancer-related death among women in the western world. although loss of cell–cell adhesion is key to breast cancer progression, little is known about the underlying mechanisms that drive tumor invasion and metastasis. here, we show that somatic loss of p120catenin (p120) in a conditional mouse model of noninvasive mammary carcinoma results in formation of stromal-dense tumors that resemble human metaplastic breast cancer and metastasize to lungs and lymph nodes. loss of p120 in anchorage-dependent breast cancer cell lines strongly promoted anoikis resistance through hypersensitization of growth factor receptor (gfr) signaling. interestingly, p120 deletion also induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines, a feature that likely underlies the formation of the prometastatic microenvironment in p120-negative mammary carcinomas. our results establish a preclinical platform to develop tailored intervention regimens that target gfr signals to treat p120-negative metastatic breast cancers. cancer res; 73(15); 4937–49. 2013 aacr.  dental enamel development occurs in stages. the ameloblast cell layer is adjacent to, and is responsible for, enamel formation. when rodent pre-ameloblasts become tall columnar secretory-stage ameloblasts, they secrete enamel matrix proteins, and the ameloblasts start moving in rows that slide by one another. this movement is necessary to form the characteristic decussating enamel prism pattern. thus, a dynamic system of intercellular interactions is required for proper enamel development. cadherins are components of the adherens junction (aj), and they span the cell membrane to mediate attachment to adjacent cells. p120 stabilizes cadherins by preventing their internalization and degradation. so, we asked if p120-mediated cadherin stability is important for dental enamel formation. targeted p120 ablation in the mouse enamel organ had a striking effect. secretory stage ameloblasts detached from surrounding tissues, lost polarity, flattened, and ameloblast e- and n-cadherin expression became undetectable by immunostaining. the enamel itself was poorly mineralized and appeared to be composed of a thin layer of merged spheres that abraded from the tooth. significantly, p120 mosaic mouse teeth were capable of forming normal enamel demonstrating that the enamel defects were not a secondary effect of p120 ablation. surprisingly, blood-filled sinusoids developed in random locations around the developing teeth. this has not been observed in other p120-ablated tissues and may be due to altered p120-mediated cell signaling. these data reveal a critical role for p120 in tooth and dental enamel development and are consistent with p120 directing the attachment and detachment of the secretory stage ameloblasts as they move in rows.
coactivation of antagonist muscles is readily observed early in motor learning, in interactions with unstable mechanical environments and in motor system pathologies. here we present evidence that the nervous system uses coactivation control far more extensively and that patterns of cocontraction during movement are closely tied to the specific requirements of the task. we have examined the changes in cocontraction that follow dynamics learning in tasks that are thought to involve finely sculpted feedforward adjustments to motor commands. we find that, even following substantial training, cocontraction varies in a systematic way that depends on both movement direction and the strength of the external load. the proportion of total activity that is due to cocontraction nevertheless remains remarkably constant. moreover, long after indices of motor learning and electromyographic measures have reached asymptotic levels, cocontraction still accounts for a significant proportion of total muscle activity in all phases of movement and in all load conditions. these results show that even following dynamics learning in predictable and stable environments, cocontraction forms a central part of the means by which the nervous system regulates movement.  cocontraction (the simultaneous activation of antagonist muscles around a joint) provides the nervous system with a way to adapt the mechanical properties of the limb to changing task requirements-both in statics and during movement. however, relatively little is known about the conditions under which the motor system modulates limb impedance through cocontraction. the goal of this study was to test for a possible relationship between cocontraction and movement accuracy in multi-joint limb movements. the electromyographic activity of seven single- and double-joint shoulder and elbow muscles was recorded using surface electrodes while subjects performed a pointing task in a horizontal plane to targets that varied randomly in size. movement speed was controlled by providing subjects with feedback on a trial-to-trial basis. measures of cocontraction were estimated both during movement and during a 200-ms window immediately following movement end. we observed an inverse relationship between target size and cocontraction: as target size was reduced, cocontraction activity increased. in addition, trajectory variability decreased and endpoint accuracy improved. this suggests that, although energetically expensive, cocontraction may be a strategy used by the motor system to facilitate multi-joint arm movement accuracy. we also observed a general trend for cocontraction levels to decrease over time, supporting the idea that cocontraction and associated limb stiffness are reduced over the course of practice.
cytochrome c (cyt c) participates in two crucial cellular processes, energy production and apoptosis, and unsurprisingly is a highly conserved protein. however, previous studies have reported for the primate lineage (i) loss of the paralogous testis isoform, (ii) an acceleration and then a deceleration of the amino acid replacement rate of the cyt c somatic isoform, and (iii) atypical biochemical behavior of human cyt c. to gain insight into the cause of these major evolutionary events, we have retraced the history of cyt c loci among primates. for testis cyt c, all primate sequences examined carry the same nonsense mutation, which suggests that silencing occurred before the primates diversified. for somatic cyt c, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and bayesian phylogenetic analyses yielded the same tree topology. the evolutionary analyses show that a fast accumulation of non-synonymous mutations (suggesting positive selection) occurred specifically on the anthropoid lineage root and then continued in parallel on the early catarrhini and platyrrhini stems. analysis of evolutionary changes using the 3d structure suggests they are focused on the respiratory chain rather than on apoptosis or other cyt c functions. in agreement with previous biochemical studies, our results suggest that silencing of the cyt c testis isoform could be linked with the decrease of primate reproduction rate. finally, the evolution of cyt c in the two sister anthropoid groups leads us to propose that somatic cyt c evolution may be related both to cox evolution and to the convergent brain and body mass enlargement in these two anthropoid clades.  rates of molecular evolution vary over time and, hence, among lineages. in contrast, widely used methods for estimating divergence times from molecular sequence data assume constancy of rates. therefore, methods for estimation of divergence times that incorporate rate variation are attractive. improvements on a previously proposed bayesian technique for divergence time estimation are described. new parameterization more effectively captures the phylogenetic structure of rate evolution on a tree. fossil information and other evidence can now be included in bayesian analyses in the form of constraints on divergence times. simulation results demonstrate that the accuracy of divergence time estimation is substantially enhanced when constraints are included.
abstract the strengths of interpersonal dyads formed by the attacker and defender in one-on-one situations are crucial for performance in team ball sports such as soccer. the purpose of this study was to analyze the kinematics of one-on-one defensive movements in soccer competitions, and determine the relationships between lower limb kinematics and the center of mass translation during cutting actions. six defensive scenes in which a player was responding to an offender’s dribble attack were selected for analysis. to reconstruct the three-dimensional kinematics of the players, we used a photogrammetric model-based image-matching technique. the hip and knee kinematics were calculated from the matched skeleton model. in addition, the center of mass height was expressed as a ratio of each participant’s body height. the relationships between the center of mass height and the kinematics were determined by the pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient. the normalized center of mass height at initial contact was correlated with the vertical center of mass displacement (r = 0.832, p = 0.040) and hip flexion angle at initial contact (r = −0.823, p = 0.044). this suggests that the lower center of mass at initial contact is an important factor to reduce the downwards vertical center of mass translation during defensive cutting actions, and that this is executed primarily through hip flexion. it is therefore recommended that players land with an adequately flexed hip at initial contact during one-on-one cutting actions to minimize the vertical center of mass excursion.  in many situations, e.g. sports injuries, three-dimensional kinematics cannot be obtained with traditional lab methods. however, if methods for reconstructing motion patterns from video sequences were available, our understanding of injury mechanisms could be improved. the aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new model-based image-matching technique for human motion reconstruction from one or more uncalibrated video sequences, using traditional motion analysis as a gold standard. a laboratory trial was conducted with one test subject performing jogging and side step cutting, while being filmed with three ordinary video cameras. this provided three single camera matchings, three double camera matchings and one triple camera matching for each of the motions. the test subject wore 33 reflective skin markers and was filmed with a seven-camera, 240 hz motion analysis system. root mean square (rms) hip and knee flexion/extension angle differences were less than 12 degrees for all the matchings. estimates for ad-/abduction (<15 degrees) and internal/external rotation (<16 degrees) were less precise. rms velocity differences up to 0.62 m/s were found for the single camera matchings, but for the triple camera matching the rms differences were less than 0.13 m/s for each direction. in conclusion, a new model-based image-matching technique has been developed, that can be used to estimate temporal joint angle histories, velocities and accelerations from uncalibrated video recordings. the kinematic estimates, in particular for center of mass velocity and acceleration, are clearly better when two or more camera views are available. this method can potentially be used to arrive at more precise descriptions of the mechanisms of sports injuries than what has been possible without elaborate methods for three-dimensional reconstruction from uncalibrated video sequences, e.g. for knee injuries.
rationaleinterstrain differences in the motivational properties of morphine and heroin have been previously reported in mice, suggesting the involvement of a genotype-dependent modulation of the rewarding effects of opiates. yet, interstrain differences in the motivational effects of naloxone have not been described.objectivesthe aim of our study was to examine genotype modulation of the motivational effects of opiates in inbred stains of mice with known, distinct, opiate-induced phenotypes, and morphine-induced striatal transcriptional responses.methodswe studied the rewarding properties of morphine (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg i.p.) and heroin (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg i.p.) in conditioned place preference (cpp) as well as the aversive properties of naloxone (1, 10, and 20 mg/kg i.p.) in the conditioned place aversion (cpa) paradigm in c57bl/6j (c57), dba/2j (dba), and swr/j (swr) inbred strains of mice.resultsour results show that morphine and heroin as well as naloxone induce cpp and cpa, respectively, in a genotype- and dose-dependent manner in these studied inbred strains of mice. interestingly, c57 mice are the most sensitive in the case of the rewarding properties of morphine and heroin but are the least sensitive to the aversive effects of naloxone, whereas the dba strain exhibit the opposite behavioral effects.conclusionswe suggest that motivational homeostasis can be modulated by mu opioid receptors in mice, with the c57 mice representing a genotype that is more sensitive to processes related to rewards, whereas the genotype of dba is more sensitive to aversion.  rationalein previous studies, we have demonstrated that mice of the inbred strain c57bl/6j (c57) are more susceptible to amphetamine-induced conditioned place preference (cpp) than dba/2j (dba) mice. moreover, we also observed parallel strain differences for the locomotor-stimulant effects of the drug. however, other studies have reported either no difference or opposite strain differences for cocaine- and morphine-induced cpp as well as for the locomotor effects of these drugs, suggesting that amphetamine-related behavioral phenotypes might depend on a specific pharmacological action of the psychostimulant.objectivesthis study was aimed at testing strain differences for cocaine- and morphine-related behavioral phenotypes in the same experimental protocol and conditions previously used for amphetamine.methodsc57 and dba mice were tested for cpp induced by cocaine (0, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) and morphine (0, 5, 7.5, and 10 mg/kg). locomotor activity data were simultaneously obtained by measuring distance moved during all different cpp phases and unconditioned locomotor activity, behavioral sensitization and conditioned hyperactivity were measured together with cpp.results(a) either cocaine or morphine promoted significant cpp at lower doses in c57 than in dba mice; (b) only drug-trained c57 mice showed a significant cpp compared with the control group; and (c) only c57 mice showed dose-dependent effects of cocaine on cpp. moreover, there was no relationship between drug-induced cpp and locomotion.conclusionsthe results demonstrate that c57 and dba mice differ in their sensitivity to cocaine- and morphine-induced cpp and suggest that the two strains differ in sensitivity to the positive incentive properties of drugs of abuse.
foreign object damage (fod) occurs when hard, millimeter-sized objects such as gravel or sand are ingested into aircraft jet engines. particles impacting turbine blades at velocities up to about 300 m=s produce small indentation craters which can become sites for fatigue crack initiation, severely limiting the lifetime of the blade. a framework for analyzing fod and its e5ect on fatigue cracking is established in this paper. finite element analysis is used to determine the residual stresses and geometric stress concentration resulting from fod. the roles of material rate sensitivity and inertia are delineated. the most important non-dimensional parameters governing impact indents are identi7ed, signi7cantly reducing the set of independent parameters. the second step in the analysis focuses on the potency of cracks emerging from critical locations at the indents. the results have been used to address the question: when and to what extent do the residual stresses and stress concentration caused by fod reduce the critical crack size associated with threshold fatigue crack growth? for deep indents, it is found that elastic stress concentration is the dominant factor in reducing critical crack threshold when the applied cyclic load ratio, r, is large, otherwise the residual stresses are also important. comparisons with a set of experiments conducted in parallel with the theory show that the numerical approach can account for various phenomena observed in practice. ? 2002 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.  the role of foreign-object damage (fod) and its effect on high-cycle fatigue (hgf) failures in a turbine engine ti– 6al–4v alloy is examined in the context of the use of the kitagawa–takahashi diagram to describe the limiting conditions for such failures. experimentally, fod is simulated by firing 1and 3.2 mm diameter steel spheres onto the flat specimen surface of tensile fatigue specimens at velocities of 200 and 300 m/s. such damage was found to markedly reduce the fatigue strength of the alloy, primarily due to four factors: stress concentration, microcrack formation, impact-induced plasticity and tensile residual stresses associated with the impact damage. two groups of fatigue failures could be identified. the first group initiated directly at the impact site, and can be readily described through the use of a fatigue-crack growth threshold concept. specifically, a kitagawa–takahashi approach is presented where the limiting threshold conditions are defined by the stress-concentration corrected smooth-bar fatigue limit (at microstructurally small crack sizes) and a ‘‘worst-case’’ fatigue-crack growth threshold (at larger crack sizes). the second group of failures was caused by fatigue cracks that initiated at locations far from the impact site in regions of high tensile residual stresses, the magnitude of which was computed numerically and measured experimentally using synchrotron x-ray diffraction. specifically, these failures could be rationalized due to the superposition of the residual stresses on the farfield applied mean stress, leading to a locally elevated load ratio (ratio of minimum to maximum loads). the effects of residual stress, stress concentration, and microstructurally small cracks are combined in a modified kitagawa– takahashi approach to provide a mechanistic basis for evaluating the detrimental effect of fod on hcf failures in ti– 6al–4v blade alloys. 2002 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.
body tilt angle affects the fatigue of human calf muscle at a high contractile force (i.e. 70 %mvc); but the range of forces across which this effect occurs is not known and we sought to determine this in the present study. fourteen men performed intermittent calf muscle contractions at either 30, 40, 50 and 60 %mvc (group 1 n = 7) or at 80 and 90 %mvc (group 2 n = 7). two tests were performed at each intensity in the supine (tilt angle = 0°) and inclined head-up position (tilt angle = 67°). mvc was measured prior to and during each calf exercise test, and the linear rate of decline in mvc during each test was used to estimate muscle fatigue. mvc prior to each test was unaffected by body tilt angle in groups 1 and 2. in group 1 muscle fatigue was significantly lower in the inclined than supine position at 50 %mvc (0.10 ± 0.05 vs. 0.19 ± 0.10 n s−1) and 60 %mvc (0.22 ± 0.20 vs. 0.36 ± 0.33 n s−1); but there was no significant difference in fatigue at 30 %mvc (0.07 ± 0.06 vs. 0.07 ± 0.07 n s−1) and 40 %mvc (0.12 ± 0.07 vs. 0.18 ± 0.08 n s−1). in group 2, muscle fatigue was significantly lower in the inclined compared with the supine position at 80 %mvc (0.90 ± 0.50 vs. 1.49 ± 0.87 n s−1) and 90 %mvc (1.19 ± 0.47 vs. 1.79 ± 0.78 n s−1). these data demonstrate that the postural effect on calf muscle fatigue during intermittent contractions is manifest at moderate to very high forces, but that it does not occur at low forces.  to explore the effect of posture on muscle performance, we tested the effects of body tilt angle on the strength, endurance, and fatigue of, and blood flow into, the plantar flexors. human subjects were fixed to a tilt table that could tilt them from the horizontal (0 degrees ) to upright (90 degrees ) position and enabled force to be applied to a footplate through isometric action of the right calf muscle. in experiment 1, six subjects performed a strength test and graded test (intermittent contractions) to the point of failure at three tilt angles (0, 47, and 90 degrees ). in experiment 2, seven subjects performed a strength test and constant-force test [70% maximum force (f(max)); intermittent contractions] to the point of failure in the horizontal and three inclined positions (32, 47, and 67 degrees ). in experiment 3, leg blood flow was assessed during constant-force exercise at two intensities (30 and 70% f(max)) and two tilt angles (0 and 67 degrees ) in six subjects. strength was not affected (p > 0.05) by tilt angle. time to failure during the graded test was significantly higher at 47 degrees (25.9 +/- 2.0 min) and 90 degrees (25.1 +/- 3.0 min) than 0 degrees (22.2 +/- 2.6 min). time to failure during the constant-force test was also significantly higher at 32 degrees (7.1 +/- 3.6 min), 47 degrees (8.0 +/- 5.2 min), and 67 degrees (8.6 +/- 5.6 min) compared with 0 degrees (4.0 +/- 2.6 min). when graded or constant-force exercise was performed with arterial flow to the leg eliminated, there were no differences in exercise time between the horizontal and an inclined position. during nonischemic exercise, leg blood flow was significantly higher during exercise in the inclined position. these results demonstrate that head-up tilt improves endurance of the plantar flexors, that this effect occurs in the absence of an effect on strength, and that it depends on an intact peripheral circulation. moreover, the postural effect on muscle endurance appears to be due to a greater blood flow into the leg, an effect that is established during the initial contractions.
the cinnamon flounder pseudorhombus cinnamoneus is a frequently consumed marine fish in china. however, the occurrence of ascaridoid larvae in p. cinnamoneus remains unclear. in the present study, a total of 85 p. cinnamoneus caught from the yellow sea (off shidao, 36°52'57″n, 122°26'42″e) in 2011, which is located between mainland china and the korean peninsula, was investigated for ascaridoid larval infection. four ascaridoid larval types, including anisakis type i of berland (1961), hysterothylacium type of smith (1983), hysterothylacium type hl of guo et al. (2014) and raphidascaris type of zhao et al. (2016), were detected in this important food fish. these larval types were identified as anisakis pegreffii, hysterothylacium aduncum, h. sinense and raphidascaris lophii, respectively, using pcr-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) analysis and sequencing of the its region of nuclear ribosomal dna (rdna). the third-stage larvae of h. sinense are reported from chinese waters for the first time. the prevalence of h. sinense was 100% and represents the predominant species of the ascaridoid larvae found in p. cinnamoneus. the prevalences of a. pegreffii and h. aduncum were 44.7% and 81.2%, respectively. phylogenetic analyses based on its sequences were performed to elucidate the genetic relationships of these ascaridoid nematodes. the present study increases the knowledge and distribution of ascaridoid larvae in this area of yellow sea. the high prevalence of ascaridoid larvae in p. cinnamoneus shows that an assessment needs to be undertaken to assess the risk these parasites may pose to public health.  two cases of gastric anisakiasis have been documented in two italian women who had consumed raw anchovies (engraulis encrasicolus). the first patient was a 49-year-old woman presenting with epigastric pain and bloody vomiting after ingestion of marinated (vinegar) raw anchovies. during the esophagogastroduodenoscopy (egds) a white color worm was detected and extracted from cardia by means of biopsy forceps. the second patient was a 59-year-old woman with irritable bowel syndrome and gastritis, who underwent to periodical egdss. in the course of the last egds, a white color round worm on antrum and a small polyp on the fundus of the stomach were observed. the two nematodes have been identified as l3 larvae of the genus anisakis by a light microscope, and as anisakis pegreffi by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. the molecular identification of the etiological agent at the species level allows to identify what anisakidae species play a zoonotic role and which are the fish host species.
beyond recognizing the actions of individuals, activity group localization aims to determine ‘‘who participates in each group’’ and ‘‘what activity the group performs’’. in this paper, we propose a latent graphical model to group participants while inferring each group’s activity by exploring the relations among them, thus simultaneously addressing the problems of group localization and activity recognition. our key insight is to exploit the relational graph among the participants. specifically, each group is represented as a tree with an activity label while relations among groups are modeled as a fully connected graph. inference of such a graph is reduced into an extended minimum spanning forest problem, which is casted into a max-margin framework. it therefore avoids the limitation of high-ordered hierarchical model and can be solved efficiently. our model is able to provide strong and discriminative contextual cues for activity recognition and to better interpret scene information for localization. experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in activity group. localization and state-of-the-arts performance on activity recognition.  in this paper we present a framework for the recognition of collective human activities. a collective activity is defined or reinforced by the existence of coherent behavior of individuals in time and space. we call such coherent behavior ‘crowd context’. examples of collective activities are “queuing in a line” or “talking”. following [7], we propose to recognize collective activities using the crowd context and introduce a new scheme for learning it automatically. our scheme is constructed upon a random forest structure which randomly samples variable volume spatio-temporal regions to pick the most discriminating attributes for classification. unlike previous approaches, our algorithm automatically finds the optimal configuration of spatio-temporal bins, over which to sample the evidence, by randomization. this enables a methodology for modeling crowd context. we employ a 3d markov random field to regularize the classification and localize collective activities in the scene. we demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of the proposed framework in a number of experiments and show that our method outperforms state-of-the art action classification techniques [7, 19].
ad-hoc networks enable mobile devices to communicate without any fixed infrastructure. while reliable multicasting has been identified as a key application in this context, we analyze different aspects of ad-hoc networks and their impact on application-layer multicast. as a result, we propose a technique of local broadcast-clustering, making use of the wireless medium's broadcast capability. we further describe a simple congestion control and also a technique for avoiding an overlay's routing inconsistencies and, thus, for stabilizing the delivery of multicast data.  we describe a new scalable application-layer multicast protocol, specifically designed for low-bandwidth, data streaming applications with large receiver sets. our scheme is based upon a hierarchical clustering of the application-layer multicast peers and can support a number of different data delivery trees with desirable properties.we present extensive simulations of both our protocol and the narada application-layer multicast protocol over internet-like topologies. our results show that for groups of size 32 or more, our protocol has lower link stress (by about 25%), improved or similar end-to-end latencies and similar failure recovery properties. more importantly, it is able to achieve these results by using orders of magnitude lower control traffic.finally, we present results from our wide-area testbed in which we experimented with 32-100 member groups distributed over 8 different sites. in our experiments, average group members established and maintained low-latency paths and incurred a maximum packet loss rate of less than 1% as members randomly joined and left the multicast group. the average control overhead during our experiments was less than 1 kbps for groups of size 100.
backgrounddrug-drug interaction extraction (ddi) needs assistance from automated methods to address the explosively increasing biomedical texts. in recent years, deep neural network based models have been developed to address such needs and they have made significant progress in relation identification.methodswe propose a dependency-based deep neural network model for ddi extraction. by introducing the dependency-based technique to a bi-directional long short term memory network (bi-lstm), we build three channels, namely, linear channel, dfs channel and bfs channel. all of these channels are constructed with three network layers, including embedding layer, lstm layer and max pooling layer from bottom up. in the embedding layer, we extract two types of features, one is distance-based feature and another is dependency-based feature. in the lstm layer, a bi-lstm is instituted in each channel to better capture relation information. then max pooling is used to get optimal features from the entire encoding sequential data. at last, we concatenate the outputs of all channels and then link it to the softmax layer for relation identification.resultsto the best of our knowledge, our model achieves new state-of-the-art performance with the f-score of 72.0% on the ddiextraction 2013 corpus. moreover, our approach obtains much higher recall value compared to the existing methods.conclusionsthe dependency-based bi-lstm model can learn effective relation information with less feature engineering in the task of ddi extraction. besides, the experimental results show that our model excels at balancing the precision and recall values.  syntactic features play an essential role in identifying relationship in a sentence. previous neural network models directly work on raw word sequences or constituent parse trees, thus often suffer from irrelevant information introduced when subjects and objects are in a long distance. in this paper, we propose to learn more robust relation representations from shortest dependency paths through a convolution neural network. we further take the relation directionality into account and propose a straightforward negative sampling strategy to improve the assignment of subjects and objects. experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-theart approaches on the semeval-2010 task 8 dataset.
copy number variants (cnvs) detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (cma) significantly contribute to understanding the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (asd) and other related conditions. in recognition of the value of cma testing and its impact on medical management, cma is in medical guidelines as a first-tier test in the evaluation of children with these disorders. as cma becomes adopted into routine care for these patients, it becomes increasingly important to report these clinical findings. this study summarizes the results of over 4 years of cma testing by a clia-certified clinical testing laboratory. using a 2.8 million probe microarray optimized for the detection of cnvs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, we report an overall cnv detection rate of 28.1% in 10,351 consecutive patients, which rises to nearly 33% in cases without asd, with only developmental delay/intellectual disability (dd/id) and/or multiple congenital anomalies (mca). the overall detection rate for individuals with asd is also significant at 24.4%. the detection rate and pathogenic yield of cma vary significantly with the indications for testing, age, and gender, as well as the specialty of the ordering doctor. we note discrete differences in the most common recurrent cnvs found in individuals with or without a diagnosis of asd.  copy number variants (cnvs) as detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (cma) significantly contribute to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as developmental delay (dd), intellectual disability (id), and autism spectrum disorder (asd). this study summarizes the results of 3.5 years of cma testing by a clia-certified clinical testing laboratory 5487 patients with neurodevelopmental conditions were clinically evaluated for rare copy number variants using a 2.8-million probe custom cma optimized for the detection of cnvs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. we report an overall detection rate of 29.4% in our neurodevelopmental cohort, which rises to nearly 33% when cases with dd/id and/or mca only are considered. the detection rate for the asd cohort is also significant, at 25%. additionally, we find that detection rate and pathogenic yield of cma vary significantly depending on the primary indications for testing, the age of the individuals tested, and the specialty of the ordering doctor. we also report a significant difference between the detection rate on the ultrahigh resolution optimized array in comparison to the array from which it originated. this increase in detection can significantly contribute to the efficient and effective medical management of neurodevelopmental conditions in the clinic.
homologous recombination requires nucleolytic degradation (resection) of dna double‐strand break (dsb) ends. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mrx complex and sae2 are involved in the onset of dsb resection, whereas extensive resection requires exo1 and the concerted action of dna2 and sgs1. here, we show that the checkpoint protein rad9 limits the action of sgs1/dna2 in dsb resection by inhibiting sgs1 binding/persistence at the dsb ends. when inhibition by rad9 is abolished by the sgs1‐ss mutant variant or by deletion of rad9, the requirement for sae2 and functional mrx in dsb resection is reduced. these results provide new insights into how early and long‐range resection is coordinated.  abstract the mre11 complex is a central component of the dna damage response, with roles in damage sensing, molecular bridging, and end resection. we have previously shown that in saccharomyces cerevisiae, ku70 (yku70) deficiency reduces the ionizing radiation sensitivity of mre11δ mutants. in this study, we show that yku70 deficiency suppressed the camptothecin (cpt) and methyl methanesulfonate (mms) sensitivity of nuclease-deficient mre11-3 and sae2δ mutants in an exo1-dependent manner. cpt-induced g2/m arrest, γ-h2ax persistence, and chromosome breaks were elevated in mre11-3 mutants. these outcomes were reduced by yku70 deficiency. given that the genotoxic effects of cpt are manifest during dna replication, these data suggest that ku limits exo1-dependent double-strand break (dsb) resection during dna replication, inhibiting the initial processing steps required for homology-directed repair. we propose that mre11 nuclease- and sae2-dependent dna end processing, which initiates dsb resection prevents ku from engaging dsbs, thus promoting exo1-dependent resection. in agreement with this idea, we show that ku affinity for binding to short single-stranded overhangs is much lower than for blunt dna ends. collectively, the data define a nonhomologous end joining (nhej)-independent, s-phase-specific function of the ku heterodimer.
for the low-cost hardware-based intrusion detection systems, this paper proposes a memory-efficient parallel string matching scheme. in order to reduce the number of state transitions, the finite state machine tiles in a string matcher adopt bit-level input symbols. long target patterns are divided into subpatterns with a fixed length; deterministic finite automata are built with the subpatterns. using the pattern dividing, the variety of target pattern lengths can be mitigated, so that memory usage in homogeneous string matchers can be efficient. in order to identify each original long pattern being divided, a two-stage sequential matching scheme is proposed for the successive matches with subpatterns. experimental results show that total memory requirements decrease on average by 47.8 percent and 62.8 percent for snort and clamav rule sets, in comparison with several existing bit-split string matching methods.  due to the advantages of easy re-configurability and scalability, the memory-based string matching architecture is widely adopted by network intrusion detection systems (nids). in order to accommodate the increasing number of attack patterns and meet the throughput requirement of networks, a successful nids system must have a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm and hardware design. in this paper, we propose a memory-efficient pattern-matching algorithm which can significantly reduce the memory requirement. for total snort string patterns, the new algorithm achieves 29% of memory reduction compared with the traditional aho-corasick algorithm [5]. moreover, since our approach is orthogonal to other memory reduction approaches, we can obtain substantial gain even after applying the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. for example, after applying the bit-split algorithm [9], we can still gain an additional 22% of memory reduction.
the ease with which persons with upper-limb amputations can control their powered prostheses is largely determined by the efficacy of the user command interface. one needs to understand the abilities of the human operator regarding the different available options. electromyography (emg) is widely used to control powered upper-limb prostheses. it is an indirect estimator of muscle force and may be expected to limit the control capabilities of the prosthesis user. this study compared emg control with force control, an interface that is used in everyday interactions with the environment. we used both methods to perform a position-tracking task. direct-position control of the wrist provided an upper bound for human-operator capabilities. the results demonstrated that an emg control interface is as effective as force control for the position-tracking task. we also examined the effects of gain and tracking frequency on emg control to explore the limits of this control interface. we found that information transmission rates for myoelectric control were best at higher tracking frequencies than at the frequencies previously reported for position control. the results may be useful for the design of prostheses and prosthetic controllers.  the characteristics of simple pursuit and compensatory manual control systems were measured with, a family of gaussian input signals having power-density spectra that covered a range of bandwidths, center frequencies, and some variety of shapes. the experimental results, presented in the form of graphs, show the nature of the dependence of human operator characteristics upon input-signal characteristics. the superiority of pursuit systems over compensatory systems is clearly demonstrated. simple analytic models that approximate these measured results are derived for both systems. the compensatory model is highly developed and relations among its parameters and those of the input have been obtained. the pursuit model is not so well developed and only approximate relations among its parameters and the input parameters have been found. the measured results and the analytic models together provide a description of manual control systems that should be useful in design of control systems.
an increased prevalence of female sexual dysfunction (fsd) has been reported in women with diabetes mellitus (dm). our aim was to evaluate correlates (psychological, cardiovascular, and neurophysiologic) of fsd in dm women without chronic diabetic complications. female sexual function index (fsfi), beck depression inventory (bdi), michigan diabetic neuropathy index (dni), and the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy (sdn) questionnaires, metabolic variables, endothelial vascular function (flow-mediated dilation, fmd), echocardiography, and electromyography were studied. 109 pre-menopausal women (18–50 years) [48 with dm (14 type 1 dm, 34 type 2 dm, duration 12.6 ± 1.91 years), and 61 healthy women] received the above questionnaires; physical activity, smoking habits, parity, bmi, waist circumference, homa-ir index, fibrinogen, cholesterol (total, hdl, ldl), triglycerides, hba1c, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein, total testosterone, and estradiol were measured; echocardiography, assessment of intima-media thickness (imt), fmd, ecg (heart rate and qtc, indexes of sympathetic activity), and electromyography were performed. fsfi total score and score for arousal, lubrication, and orgasm domains were lower in dm women than in controls (p < 0.05); dm women had higher bdi, doppler a wave peak velocity, dni, and sdn score (p < 0.001 to p < 0.04). doppler e wave peak velocity, peroneal, posterior tibial and sural nerves conduction velocity and amplitude were lower in diabetic women than in controls (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). fsfi score was positively correlated with physical activity, doppler e wave peak velocity, and peroneal nerve amplitude and negatively with bdi, parity, imt, sdn, and hba1c (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). at stepwise regression, sdn score (negatively) and doppler e wave peak velocity (positively) predicted fsfi score (r = 507, p < 0.001). in conclusion, cardiovascular and neurological impairments are associated with fsd in diabetic women. follow-up studies are required to evaluate sexual dysfunction as a risk factor for future cardiovascular or neurological events.  sexual functioning consists of several phases: desire, arousal, plateau, orgasm, and resolution (1). sexual arousal results from a spinal cord reflex. spinal segments are under excitatory and inhibitory control from supramechanisms, i.e. hypothalamus with its excitatory and androgen receptors. the afferent end is the pudendal nerve, and the efferent one is a coordinated somatic (bulbocavernous, including s2, s3 and s4 sacral segments, which result in muscle contraction) and autonomic nervous system (vaginal and clitoral cavernous autonomic nerves, resulting in clitoral, vaginal and labial enlargement).
we used 2,3-butanedione monoxime (bdm) to suppress work by the perfused rat heart and to investigate the effects of calcium on nadh production and tissue energetics. hearts were perfused with buffer containing bdm and elevated perfusate calcium to maintain the rates of cardiac work and oxygen consumption at levels similar to those of control perfused hearts. bdm plus calcium hearts displayed higher levels of nadh surface fluorescence, indicating calcium activation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases. these hearts, however, displayed 20% lower phosphocreatine levels. bdm suppressed the rates of state 3 respiration of isolated mitochondria. uncoupled respiration was suppressed to a lesser degree, and the state 4 respiration rates were not affected. double-inhibitor experiments with liver mitochondria using bdm and carboxyatractyloside (cat) were used to identify the site of inhibition. bdm at low levels (0-5 mm) suppressed respiration. in the presence of cat at levels that inhibit respiration by 60%, low levels of bdm were without effect. because these effects were not additive, bdm does not inhibit adenine nucleotide transport. this was supported by an assay of adenine nucleotide transport in liver mitochondria. bdm did not inhibit atp hydrolysis by submitochondrial particles but strongly suppressed reversed electron transport from succinate to nad(+). oxidation of nadh by submitochondrial particles was inhibited by bdm but oxidation of succinate was not. we conclude that bdm inhibits electron transport at site 1.  the surface fluorescence of the isolated perfused rat heart has been evaluated for the purpose of nad(p)h quantitation. with the use of excitation at 340, 380, 415, and 430 nm with emission detection at 500 +/- 20 nm, the intensities at 340 and 380 nm excitation were found to be linearly related during nad(p)h oxidation/reduction induced by changes in substrate availability. changes in cardiac nad(p)h caused similar changes at 340 and 380 nm excitation, but those at 340 nm were of greater magnitude. isolated cardiac mitochondria exhibited essentially identical optical properties during changes in nad(p)h content induced by changes in substrate availability and by nad(h) oxidation/reduction caused by coupled phosphorylation of adp. the changes in redox status of both isolated mitochondria and the intact perfused heart can be expressed by a 340/380 excitation fluorescence ratio because of these relationships. this value assumed a minimum and maximum value under conditions of complete oxidation and reduction, respectively. use of this ratio in the perfused heart avoids the artifacts caused by cardiac motion and tissue stretch. removal of motion artifacts with an excitation ratio could only be accomplished if the measurements at 340 and 380 nm were estimated at the same point in the cardiac cycle. a method of cardiac waveform reconstruction and signal averaging is described to obtain these data from sequential measurements. with these techniques, the reduction of cardiac nad(p)h can be expressed as a percentage of the range obtained between minimum and maximum reduction. the described technique is of general utility in the assessment of cardiac bioenergetics.
real-time three-dimensional (rt3d) echocardiography is a new image acquisition technique that allows instantaneous acquisition of volumetric images for quantitative assessment of cardiac morphology and function. to quantify many important diagnostic parameters, such as ventricular volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output, an automatic algorithm to delineate the left ventricle (lv) from rt3d echocardiographic images is essential. while a number of efforts have been made towards segmentation of the lv endocardial (endo) boundaries, the segmentation of epicardial (epi) boundaries remains problematic. in this paper, we present a coupled deformable model that addresses this problem. the idea behind our method is that the volume of the myocardium is close to being constant during a cardiac cycle and our model uses this coupling as an important constraint. we employ two surfaces, each driven by the image-derived information that takes into account ultrasound physics by modeling the speckle statistics using the nakagami distribution while maintaining the coupling. by simultaneously evolving two surfaces, the final segmentation of the myocardium is thus achieved. results from 80 sets of synthetic data and 286 sets of real canine data were evaluated against the ground truth and against outlines from three independent observers, respectively. we show that results obtained with our incompressibility constraint were more accurate than those obtained without constraint or with a wall thickness constraint, and were comparable to those from manual segmentation.  this study investigated the use of artificial neural networks (ann) for image segmentation and spatial temporal contour linking for the detection of endocardial contours on echocardiographic images. using a backpropagation network, the system was trained with 279 sample regions obtained from eight training images to segment images into either tissue or blood pool region. the ann system was then applied to parasternal short axis images of 38 patients. spatial temporal contour linking was performed on the segmented images to extract endocardial boarders. left ventricular areas (end-systolic and end-diastolic) determined with the automated system were calculated and compared to results obtained by manual contour tracing performed by two independent investigators. in addition, ejection fractions (ef) were derived using the area-length method and compared with radionuclide ventriculography. image quality was classified as good in 12 (32%), moderate in 13 (34%) and poor in 13 (34%) patients. the ann system provided estimates of end-diastolic and end-systolic areas in 36 (89%) of echocardiograms, which correlated well with those obtained by manual tracing (r = 0.99, see = 1.44). a good agreement was also found for the comparison of ef between the ann system and tc-radionuclide ventriculography (rnv, r = 0.93, see = 6.36). the ann system also performed well in the subset of patients with poor image quality. endocardial contour detection using artificial neural networks and spatial temporal contour linking allows accurate calculations of ventricular areas from transthoracic echocardiograms and performs well even in images with poor quality. this system could greatly enhance the feasibility, accuracy and reproducibility of calculating cardiac areas to derive left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions.
scn8a is a major neuronal sodium channel gene expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. mutations of scn8a result in movement disorders and impaired cognition. to investigate the basis for the tissue-specific expression of scn8a, we located conserved, potentially regulatory sequences in the human, mouse, chicken, and fish genes by 5′ race of brain rna and genomic sequence comparison. a highly conserved 5′ noncoding exon, exon 1c, is present in vertebrates from fish to mammals and appears to define the ancestral promoter region. the distance from exon 1c to the first coding exon increased tenfold during vertebrate evolution, largely by insertion of repetitive elements. the mammalian gene acquired three novel, mutually exclusive noncoding exons that are not represented in the lower vertebrates. within the shared exon 1c, we identified four short sequence elements of 10-20 bp with an unusually high level of evolutionary conservation. the conserved elements are most similar to consensus sites for the transcription factors pou6f1/brn5, yy1, and rest/nrsf. introduction of mutations into the predicted pou6f1 and rest sites reduced promoter activity in transfected neuronal cells. a 470-bp promoter fragment containing all of the conserved elements directed brain-specific expression of the lacz reporter in transgenic mice. transgene expression was highest in hippocampal neurons and cerebellar purkinje cells, consistent with the expression of the endogenous gene. the compact cluster of conserved regulatory elements in scn8a provides a useful target for molecular analysis of neuronal gene expression.  to identify the transcriptional start sites of the neuronal channel scn8a, we carried out 5'-race (rapid amplification of cdna ends) with rna from human and mouse brain. we recovered four mutually exclusive 5'-untranslated exons (exon 1a to exon 1d) that map to a 1.8-kb region of genomic dna located approximately 70 kb upstream of the first coding exon. the same 5'-untranslated exons are expressed in central, peripheral and sympathetic nervous system and in embryonic and adult brain. a 4.8-kb genomic fragment containing these 5' exons demonstrated promoter activity in transfected mn-1 cells. in transgenic mice, transcription of the 4.8-kb promoter was restricted to brain and spinal cord. the 4.8-kb promoter contains eight consensus sp1-binding sites and two inr sites. a potential nrse/re-1 site is located nearby. two active polyadenylation sites identified by 3'-race are conserved in human, mouse, and chicken scn8a. sequence comparison of human and mouse scn8a identified 12 conserved noncoding elements whose effect on transcription was tested in transfected cells.
microbiota decussata kom. (cupressaceae) is a subalpine species endemic to the sikhote alin mountains with populations scattered throughout the range. we used sequence data for four noncoding regions of chloroplast dna to characterize the genetic diversity in populations sampled from different parts of m. decussata natural range. no variation was observed in the trnt–trnf region, whereas the trnh–psba, trns–trnfm, and trns–trng regions showed polymorphisms. at the species level, we found a low nucleotide diversity (π = 0.0009) and high haplotype diversity (h = 0.981) as well as high differentiation (φst = 0.420). nst and gst values suggested the existence of a phylogeographic structure in m. decussata. the observed patterns of diversity could be explained in part by ecological features of the species and its long-term persistence throughout the range with population expansion, successive fragmentation and isolation.  plants offer excellent models to investigate how gene flow shapes the organization of genetic diversity. their three genomes can have different modes of transmission and will hence experience varying levels of gene flow. we have compiled studies of genetic structure based on chloroplast dna (cpdna), mitochondrial dna (mtdna) and nuclear markers in seed plants. based on a data set of 183 species belonging to 103 genera and 52 families, we show that the precision of estimates of genetic differentiation (gst) used to infer gene flow is mostly constrained by the sampling of populations. mode of inheritance appears to have a major effect on gst. maternally inherited genomes experience considerably more subdivision (median value of 0.67) than paternally or biparentally inherited genomes (∼0.10). gst at cpdna and mtdna markers covary narrowly when both genomes are maternally inherited, whereas gst at paternally and biparentally inherited markers also covary positively but more loosely and gst at maternally inherited markers are largely independent of values based on nuclear markers. a model‐based gross estimate suggests that, at the rangewide scale, historical levels of pollen flow are generally at least an order of magnitude larger than levels of seed flow (median of the pollen‐to‐seed migration ratio: 17) and that pollen and seed gene flow vary independently across species. finally, we show that measures of subdivision that take into account the degree of similarity between haplotypes (nst or rst) make better use of the information inherent in haplotype data than standard measures based on allele frequencies only.

the aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between retrospectively assessed childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) symptoms, aggression – impulsivity, and plasma sex hormone levels, in a group of 44 rapists. all participants completed the wender utah rating scale (wurs), the aggression questionnaire, the life-time history of aggression, the barratt impulsivity scale, the suicide risk scale, and the temperament and character inventory. levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone were estimated in plasma samples, and free androgen index was calculated. the subgroup of rapists with wurs score of 46 or higher (n = 27) evidenced significantly higher levels of self-reported aggression, life-time history of aggression, and impulsivity, as well as significantly higher scores on novelty seeking and self-transcendence and significantly lower scores on self-directedness and cooperativeness, in comparison with the subgroup with wurs scores of 45 and lower. the wurs score showed a positive correlation with aggression, impulsivity, and suicidality. plasma sex hormone levels did not show any differences between the two rapist subgroups. history of childhood adhd symptoms in this sample of rapists was linked to higher levels of aggression, impulsivity, and suicidality, a temperament profile characterized by frequent exploratory activity and quick loss of temper, and a character profile characterized by purposeless, difficulty accepting others, and lack of empathy. lastly, a history of childhood adhd symptoms does not seem to be linked to adult plasma sex hormone levels.  objective in an attempt to surmount the problem of retrospectively establishing the childhood diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the authors constructed the 61-item wender utah rating scale (wurs) for adults to use to describe their own childhood behavior. in this paper they present their initial data collection and evaluation of the instrument's validity.   method the scale was administered to 81 adult outpatients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 100 "normal" adults, and 70 psychiatric adult outpatients with unipolar depression. the authors analyzed data from the 25 items of the scale that showed the greatest difference between the patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the normal comparison subjects and the relationship between the wurs and the patients' parents' judgment of childhood activity as measured by the parents' rating scale.   results the patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder had significantly higher mean scores on all 25 items than did the two comparison groups. the difference between the mean total scores of the patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the normal subjects was also highly significant. a cutoff score of 46 or higher correctly identified 86% of the patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 99% of the normal subjects, and 81% of the depressed subjects. correlations obtained between wurs scores and parents' rating scale scores were moderate but impressive. the ability of wurs scores to predict response to methylphenidate replicated the authors' finding regarding the ability of parents' rating scale scores to predict response to pemoline.   conclusions the wurs is sensitive in identifying childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and may be useful in recognizing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in patients with ambiguous adult psychopathology.
atrial fibrillation (af) is the most frequent form of arrhythmia occurring in the industrialized world. because of its complex nature, each identified form of af requires specialized treatment. thus, an in-depth understanding of the bases of these arrhythmias is essential for therapeutic development. a variety of experimental studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms of af are performed using primary cultures of neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes (nrams). previously, we have shown that the distinct advantage of nram cultures is that they allow standardized, systematic, robust re-entry induction in the presence of a constitutively-active acetylcholine-mediated k+ current (ikach-c). experimental studies dedicated to mechanistic explorations of af, using these cultures, often use computer models for detailed electrophysiological investigations. however, currently, no mathematical model for nrams is available. therefore, in the present study we propose the first model for the action potential (ap) of a nram with constitutively-active acetylcholine-mediated k+ current (ikach-c). the descriptions of the ionic currents were based on patch-clamp data obtained from neonatal rats. our monolayer model closely mimics the action potential duration (apd) restitution and conduction velocity (cv) restitution curves presented in our previous in vitro studies. in addition, the model reproduces the experimentally observed dynamics of spiral wave rotation, in the absence and in the presence of drug interventions, and in the presence of localized myofibroblast heterogeneities.  1. voltage clamp studies of the excitatory sodium current, ina, were carried out in rabbit cardiac purkinje fibres using th two‐micro‐electrode technique. previous work has shown the rabbit purkinje fibre to have relatively simple morphology (sommer & johnson, 1968) and electrical structure (colatsky & tsien, 1979a) compared to other cardiac preparations. 2. non‐uniformities in membrane potential were kept small by reducing the size of ina to less than 50 microa/cm2 of total membrane surface area through prepulse inactivation or removal of external sodium, nao. temporal resolution was improved by cooling to 10‐26 degrees c. these adjustments did not greatly alter the measured properties of the sodium channel. 3. under these conditions, sodium currents were recorded satisfying a number of criteria for adequate voltage control. direct measurement of longitudinal non‐uniformity using a second voltage electrode showed only small deviations at the time of peak current. 4. the properties of the sodium channel were examined using conventional protocols. both peak sodium permeability, pna, and steady‐state sodium inactivation, h infinity, showed a sigmoidal dependence on membrane potential. pna rose steeply with small depolarizations, increasing roughly e‐fold per 3.2 mv, and reaching half‐maximal activation at ‐30 +/‐ 2 mv. the h infinity ‐v curve had a midpoint of ‐74.9 +/‐ 2 mv and a reciprocal slope of 4.56 +/‐ 0.13 mv at temperatures of 10‐19.5 degrees c, and showed a dependence on temperature, shifting to more negative potentials with cooling (approximately 3 mv/10 degrees c). recovery of ina from inactivation in double pulse experiments followed a single exponential time course with time constants of 108‐200 msec at 19 degrees c for holding potentials near ‐80 mv. no attempt was made to describe the activation kinetics because of uncertainties about the early time course of the current. 5. these data predict a maximum duration for ina of less than 1‐2 msec and a maximum peak current density of about 500 microa/cm2 under physiological conditions, i.e. 37 degrees c and 150 mm‐nao. this current magnitude is sufficient to discharge the membrane capacitance at rates comparable to those measured experimentally (311 +/‐ 27 v/sec, colatsky & tsien, 1979a). 6. the limitations of the method are discussed. the major problem is the longitudinal cable delay which limits the speed of voltage control. this makes it difficult to separate the activation of ina from the decay of the capacity transient for potentials positive to ‐15 mv. 7. it is concluded that the approach described is valid for measurements of sodium currents in the potential range where action potentials are initiated, making it possible to study cardiac sodium channels in an adult mammalian preparation which is free of enzymatic treatment.
in this paper we investigate the fine-grained object categorization problem of determining fish species in low-quality visual data (images and videos) recorded in real-life settings. we first describe a new annotated dataset of about 35,000 fish images (ma-35k dataset), derived from the fish4knowledge project, covering 10 fish species from the eastern indo-pacific bio-geographic zone. we then resort to a label propagation method able to transfer the labels from the ma-35k to a set of 20 million fish images in order to achieve variability in fish appearance. the resulting annotated dataset, containing over one million annotations (aa-1m), was then manually checked by removing false positives as well as images with occlusions between fish or showing partially fish. finally, we randomly picked more than 30,000 fish images distributed among ten fish species and extracted from about 400 10-minute videos, and used this data (both images and videos) for the fish task of the lifeclef 2014 contest. together with the fine-grained visual dataset release, we also present two approaches for fish species classification in, respectively, still images and videos. both approaches showed high performance (for some fish species the precision and recall were close to one) in object classification and outperformed state-of-the-art methods. in addition, despite the fact that dataset is unbalanced in the number of images per species, both methods (especially the one operating on still images) appear to be rather robust against the long-tail curse of data, showing the best performance on the less populated object classes.  to build a detailed knowledge of the biodiversity, the geographical distribution and the evolution of the alive species is essential for a sustainable development and the preservation of this biodiversity. massive databases of underwater video surveillance have been recently made available for supporting designing algorithms targeting the identification of fishes. however these video datasets are rather poor in terms of video resolution, pretty challenging regarding both the natural phenomena to be considered such as murky water, seaweed moving the water current, etc, and the huge amount of data to be processed. we have designed a processing chain based on background segmentation, selection keypoints with an adaptive scale, description with opponentsift and learning of each species by a binary linear support vector machines classifier.  our algorithm has been evaluated in the context of our participation to the fish task of the lifeclef2014 challenge. compared to the baseline designed by the lifeclef challenge organizers, our approach reaches a better precision but a worse recall. our performances in terms of species recognition (based only on the correctly detected bounding boxes) is comparable to the baseline, but our bounding boxes are often too large and our score is so penalized. our results are thus really encouraging.
exact assessment of the autonomic nervous system’s (ans) activity by means of heart rate variability (hrv) is a long-standing challenge. although many techniques have been proposed to take up the challenge, none ever proposed a rationale for the approach behind the technique or a satisfying discrimination of the two activities which underlie the autonomic control of hrv. we here propose a new method, providing both an understanding of the discrimination’s nature and a framework which we believe leads to a thorough assessment of the sympathovagal balance, as a trajectory between points in a well-chosen space. the methodology assumes tools from scale invariance/covariance physics. the sympathovagal balance is obtained on a beat-to-beat basis with the dynamics portrayed through a trajectory. furthermore, universal trajectories are sought which would comprehensively describe the effect of atropine and isoproterenol injections on systems underlying the heart pace variations. non-invasive assessment of the respective activities of the sympathetic and parasympathetic subsystems of the ans would be possible through cardiac autonomic measurements.  general introduction from fractal objects to fractal spaces fractal dimension of a quantum path the fractal structure of the quantum space-time towards a linear theory of scale relativity prospects.
self-serving cognitions and callous-unemotional traits play important roles in adolescent antisocial behavior. the objective of this study was to cross-sectionally explore the mediating role of self-serving cognitions in the relationship between callous-unemotional traits and antisocial behavior. a sample of 972 high-school students completed self-report questionnaires assessing callous-unemotional traits, self-serving cognitive distortions and antisocial behavior. two competing models exploring indirect effects accounting for the relationships between self-serving cognitive distortions, callous-unemotional traits and antisocial behaviors were tested. both models revealed significant indirect effects, suggesting both pathways are possible. gender was found to moderate these models. these findings suggest the importance of targeting self-serving cognitions in therapeutic interventions and increase our understanding of the role of self-serving cognitions in antisocial behavior.  this study investigates the relationship between the self-report youth psychopathic traits inventory (ypi) and the clinician-rated psychopathy checklist: youth version (pcl:yv). a representative sample of 92 girls and 70 boys, 12 to 20 years of age (mean age, 17 years), who received services at a clinic for adolescents with substance misuse problems, was studied. moderate correlations (r =.30—.51) were found between conceptually corresponding ypi and pcl:yv factor scores among both boys and girls, whereas correlations between individual subscales of the ypi and items of the pcl:yv were not as consistent. a cross-tabulation of groupings based on the three-factor models of the two instruments largely supported the categorical convergent validity of the ypi, particularly for low and high scorers. although more studies with larger samples are needed, results indicate that the ypi is a cost-effective measure of psychopathic traits in adolescents in research settings.
the purpose of the study was to evaluate psychological comorbidity in drug-naive or drug-free primary restless legs syndrome (p-rls) patients with nocturnal eating disorder (ned), and to analyze the association of comorbid p-rls and ned with obsessive-compulsive, mood and anxiety symptoms, and personality. participants comprised 20 consecutive female outpatients with p-rls, 10 without ned and 10 with ned, and 10 female controls matched for age. both patients and controls were evaluated by the hamilton depression and the anxiety rating scales, the state-trait anxiety inventory, the maudsley obsessive compulsive inventory and the temperament and character inventory—revised. compared to controls, p-rls patients without and with ned had higher trait anxiety and current anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. p-rls patients with ned also had significantly higher doubting compared to p-rls patients without ned. furthermore, groups differed for harm avoidance (ha), with p-rls patients with and without ned having higher scores than controls. untreated p-rls patients, particularly those with nocturnal eating, report anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, perceive stressful situations as dangerous and threatening and tend to respond with anxiety to such situations. they have higher tendency to respond intensely to aversive stimuli, inhibiting behavior to avoid punishment, novelty, and frustrative omission of expected rewards. we hypothesize that higher levels of ha, a biologically determined personality trait, might constitute a diathesis predisposing individuals to display obsessive-compulsive symptoms, namely increasingly severe compulsive nocturnal eating.  abstract a simple questionnaire was developed as an instrument for assessing the existence and extent of different obsessional-compulsive complaints. two major types of complaint, checking and washing compulsions, and two minor types, slowness and doubting, were established. the final form of the questionnaire, and major properties, are presented.
supervised 3d reconstruction has witnessed a significant progress through the use of deep neural networks. however, this increase in performance requires large scale annotations of 2d/3d data. in this paper, we explore inexpensive 2d supervision as an alternative for expensive 3d cad annotation. specifically, we use foreground masks as weak supervision through a raytrace pooling layer that enables perspective projection and backpropagation. additionally, since the 3d reconstruction from masks is an ill posed problem, we propose to constrain the 3d reconstruction to the manifold of unlabeled realistic 3d shapes that match mask observations. we demonstrate that learning a log-barrier solution to this constrained optimization problem resembles the gan objective, enabling the use of existing tools for training gans. we evaluate and analyze the manifold constrained reconstruction on various datasets for single and multi-view reconstruction of both synthetic and real images.  inspired by the recent success of methods that employ shape priors to achieve robust 3d reconstructions, we propose a novel recurrent neural network architecture that we call the 3d recurrent reconstruction neural network (3d-r2n2). the network learns a mapping from images of objects to their underlying 3d shapes from a large collection of synthetic data [13]. our network takes in one or more images of an object instance from arbitrary viewpoints and outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3d occupancy grid. unlike most of the previous works, our network does not require any image annotations or object class labels for training or testing. our extensive experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for single view reconstruction, and (ii) enables the 3d reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional sfm/slam methods fail (because of lack of texture and/or wide baseline).
we present a dynamic model selection approach for resource-constrained prediction. given an input instance at test-time, a gating function identifies a prediction model for the input among a collection of models. our objective is to minimize overall average cost without sacrificing accuracy. we learn gating and prediction models on fully labeled training data by means of a bottom-up strategy. our novel bottom-up method is a recursive scheme whereby a high-accuracy complex model is first trained. then a low-complexity gating and prediction model are subsequently learnt to adaptively approximate the high-accuracy model in regions where low-cost models are capable of making highly accurate predictions. we pose an empirical loss minimization problem with cost constraints to jointly train gating and prediction models. on a number of benchmark datasets our method outperforms state-of-the-art achieving higher accuracy for the same cost.  tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. in this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called xgboost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. we propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. more importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. by combining these insights, xgboost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.
in 1986, an interspinous dynamic stabilization system (the prototype of the current wallis implant) was designed to stiffen unstable operated degenerate lumbar segments with a hard interspinous blocker to limit extension and a tension band around the spinous processes to secure the implant and limit flexion. restoring physiological mechanical conditions to the treated level(s) while preserving some intervertebral mobility was intended to treat low-back pain related to degenerative instability without increasing stress forces in the adjacent segments. the procedure was easily reversible. if low back pain persisted or recurred, the device was removed and stability was achieved using fusion. the intermediate-term results were promising, but the long-term safety and efficacy of this dynamic interspinous stabilization device has not been previously documented. we retrospectively reviewed the hospital files of all the patients (n = 241) who had this dynamic stabilization system implanted between 1987 and 1995, contacting as many as possible to determine the actuarial survivorship of the system. in this manner, 142 of the 241 patients (58.9%) were contacted by telephone. the endpoints used for the survivorship analysis were ‘any subsequent lumbar operation’ and ‘implant removal’. at 14 years follow-up, values of actuarial survivorship with 95% confidence interval were 75.9 ± 8.3 and 81.3 ± 6.8% for the endpoints ‘any subsequent lumbar operation’ and ‘implant removal’, respectively. there was no difference in survivorship of multiple-level implants with respect to single-level devices. although the conclusions of the present study must be tempered by the 41% attrition rate, these findings support the long-term safety of this system, and possibly long-term protective action against adjacent-level degeneration by motion preservation. outcomes at least equivalent to those of fusion were observed without the primary drawbacks of fusion.  the use of survivorship analysis requires an assumption that patients who are lost to follow-up are no more or less likely to be at risk of failure of an operation or a procedure than are patients who are still being followed. this is a major assumption in long-term orthopaedic studies, in which a high percentage of patients are usually lost to follow-up. we compared the survivorship curve for the first 100 tharies replacements done at our institution (which were completed by september 1977), using data that were collected in the standard way up to 1985, through a letter requesting a follow-up visit, with the curve for the same patients that was based on almost complete follow-up data that were gathered by telephone from 1985 on. the similarity of the two curves suggested that the assumptions that are necessary for the validity of survivorship analysis are reasonable, even in the orthopaedic setting, in which many patients are lost to follow-up. the usefulness of the survivorship curve for prediction was also evaluated by comparing the curve based on the first forty-six of the 100 tharies replacements (before 1977) with the curve based on the last fifty-four such operations (from january 1977 to september 1977). the results of these two comparisons suggest that survivorship analysis is a valid technique to use in the long-term evaluation of patients who have had a joint replacement.
due to the wide application of composite insulators in the power industry, the insulator performance is challenged by various environments. to determine the flashover performance of rime-iced composite insulator, laboratory investigation was carried out in an artificial climate chamber to simulate different rime-ice morphology on the insulator surface. the configuration and characteristics of the rime-ice were demonstrated to establish the relationship between the rime-ice parameters and the flashover performance. in accordance with the discharge phenomena, the transition of leakage current (lc) until the flashover was analyzed by using a recurrent plot approach. after extracting the high frequency components by using a wavelet transform technique, the lc just before the flashover was extended to m dimensional phase space based on a phase space reconstructed method. the recurrent plot was obtained to reveal the non-linear characteristics of lc for identifying the dynamic behaviors on the insulator surface. it is shown that the propagation and properties of the discharges can be graphically projected on the topological structure of recurrent plot as a function of the rime-ice parameters. the process and underlying mechanism of flashover performance of rime-iced composite insulator can be visually reflected by the recurrent plot and the quantitative indicators of lc.  due to the widespread use of polymeric insulating materials in radiation environments, there is an increasing demand to evaluate the radiation effects on the surface dielectric characteristics of polymeric insulating materials. this paper presents a recurrence plot approach to analyze the surface discharge of gamma-ray irradiated polymeric insulating materials based on the tracking test described in iec60112. because the resulting comparative tracking index has wide variation, an attempt has been made to evaluate the resistance to tracking more consistently. in this research, for different dosages of gamma-ray irradiation, the discharge currents are detected when the discharge occurs on the sample surface. recurrence plots of the discharge currents are derived. it is found that the resistance to tracking could be projected on a map as a function of the dosage of irradiation. the recurrence plots are sensitive and give visual methods for identification of the dosage of irradiation effects on the resistance to tracking. results obtained show that with the increase of dosage of irradiation, the resistance to tracking of polybutylene terephthalate decreases, but increases for polyethylene terephthalate.
a successful partial delete relaxation method is to compute hff in a compiled planning task ∏c which represents a set c of conjunctions explicitly. while this compilation view of such partial delete relaxation is simple and elegant, its meaning with respect to the original planning task is opaque. we provide a direct characterization of h+(∏c), without compilation, making explicit how it arises from a "marriage" of the critical-path heuristic hm with (a somewhat novel view of) h+. this explicit view allows us to derive a direct characterization of hff (∏c), which in turn allows us to compute a version of that heuristic function in time polynomial in |c|.  heuristic functions based on the delete relaxation compute upper and lower bounds on the optimal delete-relaxation heuristic h+, and are of paramount importance in both optimal and satisficing planning. here we introduce a principled and flexible technique for improving h+, by augmenting delete-relaxed planning tasks with a limited amount of delete information. this is done by introducing special fluents that explicitly represent conjunctions of fluents in the original planning task, rendering h+ the perfect heuristic h* in the limit. previous work has introduced a method in which the growth of the task is potentially exponential in the number of conjunctions introduced. we formulate an alternative technique relying on conditional effects, limiting the growth of the task to be linear in this number. we show that this method still renders h+ the perfect heuristic h* in the limit. we propose techniques to find an informative set of conjunctions to be introduced in different settings, and analyze and extend existing methods for lower-bounding and upperbounding h+ in the presence of conditional effects. we evaluate the resulting heuristic functions empirically on a set of ipc benchmarks, and show that they are sometimes much more informative than standard delete-relaxation heuristics.
the use of selected probiotics, prebiotics and/or synbiotics, constitute an interesting dietary strategy for intestinal microbiota modulation in case of dysbiosis. species of the genus bifidobacterium are among the most currently used probiotics for human consumption since they have shown beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of some disorders. bifidobacteria are saccharolytic microorganisms, but their ability to use different carbohydrates varies among strains. in this study, we investigate the utilization of three prebiotic substrates (two different short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides [scfos] and inulin) by strains of bifidobacterium, in order to determine the synbiotic potential of the different probiotic/prebiotic combinations. batch culture fermentations from six bifidobacterium strains (bifidobacterium longum ipla20021, b. longum ipla20022, bifidobacterium animalis ipla20031, b. animalis ipla20032, b. animalis ipla20020 and b. animalis bb12) were carried out in the presence of inulin or scfos (synergy or actilight), or glucose, as carbon source. bifidobacteria levels were quantified by plate counting. the ph and production of organic acids in the different batch-culture fermentations were also determined. our results showed that all the studied strains of b. animalis and b. longum were able to utilize scfos but not inulin. the use of scfos as carbon source affected the pattern of metabolite's production, when compared with cultures carried out in glucose, particularly in the case of b. longum. the results indicated that the scfos are well suited to be used in combination with b. animalis or b. longum strains for the development of synbiotic foods or food supplements.  the effects of dietary short chain fructooligosaccharides (scfos) incorporation on hematology, fish immune status, gut microbiota composition, digestive enzymes activities, and gut morphology, was evaluated in gilthead sea bream (sparus aurata) juveniles reared at 18 °c and 25 °c. for that purpose, fish with 32 g were fed diets including 0, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5% scfos during 8 weeks. overall, scfos had only minor effects on gilthead sea bream immune status. lymphocytes decreased in fish fed the 0.1% scfos diet. fish fed the 0.5% scfos diet presented increased nitric oxide (no) production, while total immunoglobulins (ig) dropped in those fish, but only in the ones reared at 25 °c. red blood cells, hemoglobin, bactericidal activity and no were higher at 25 °c, whereas total white blood cells, circulating thrombocytes, monocytes and neutrophils were higher at 18 °c. in fish fed scfos, lymphocytes were higher at 18 °c. total ig were also higher at 18 °c but only in fish fed 0.1% and 0.5% scfos diets. no differences in gut bacterial profiles were detected by pcr-dgge (polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) between dietary treatments. however, group's similarity was higher at 25 °c. digestive enzymes activities were higher at 25 °c but were unaffected by prebiotics incorporation. gut morphology was also unaffected by dietary prebiotic incorporation. overall, gut microbiota composition, digestive enzymes activities and immunity parameters were affected by rearing temperature whereas dietary scfos incorporation had only minor effects on these parameters. in conclusion, at the tested levels scfos does not seem worthy of including it in gilthead sea bream juveniles diets.
we present an efficient and scalable solution to estimate uncertain transport behaviors—stochastic flow maps (sfms)—for visualizing and analyzing uncertain unsteady flows. computing flow maps from uncertain flow fields is extremely expensive because it requires many monte carlo runs to trace densely seeded particles in the flow. we reduce the computational cost by decoupling the time dependencies in sfms so that we can process shorter sub time intervals independently and then compose them together for longer time periods. adaptive refinement is also used to reduce the number of runs for each location. we parallelize over tasks—packets of particles in our design—to achieve high efficiency in mpi/thread hybrid programming. such a task model also enables cpu/gpu coprocessing. we show the scalability on two supercomputers, mira (up to 256k blue gene/q cores) and titan (up to 128k opteron cores and 8k gpus), that can trace billions of particles in seconds.  the objective of this paper is to understand transport behavior in uncertain time-varying flow fields by redefining the finite-time lyapunov exponent (ftle) and lagrangian coherent structure (lcs) as stochastic counterparts of their traditional deterministic definitions. three new concepts are introduced: the distribution of the ftle (d-ftle), the ftle of distributions (ftle-d), and uncertain lcs (u-lcs). the d-ftle is the probability density function of ftle values for every spatiotemporal location, which can be visualized with different statistical measurements. the ftle-d extends the deterministic ftle by measuring the divergence of particle distributions. it gives a statistical overview of how transport behaviors vary in neighborhood locations. the u-lcs, the probabilities of finding lcss over the domain, can be extracted with stochastic ridge finding and density estimation algorithms. we show that our approach produces better results than existing variance-based methods do. our experiments also show that the combination of d-ftle, ftle-d, and u-lcs can help users understand transport behaviors and find separatrices in ensemble simulations of atmospheric processes.
in this study, we investigated the neural basis of virtual time to contact (vtc) and the hypothesis that vtc provides predictive information for future postural instability. a novel approach to differentiate stable pre-falling and transition-to-instability stages within a single postural trial while a subject was performing a challenging single leg stance with eyes closed was developed. specifically, we utilized wavelet transform and stage segmentation algorithms using vtc time series data set as an input. the vtc time series was time-locked with multichannel (n = 64) eeg signals to examine its underlying neural substrates. to identify the focal sources of neural substrates of vtc, a two-step approach was designed combining the independent component analysis (ica) and low-resolution tomography (loreta) of multichannel eeg. there were two major findings: (1) a significant increase of vtc minimal values (along with enhanced variability of vtc) was observed during the transition-to-instability stage with progression to ultimate loss of balance and falling; and (2) this vtc dynamics was associated with pronounced modulation of eeg predominantly within theta, alpha and gamma frequency bands. the sources of this eeg modulation were identified at the cingulate cortex (acc) and the junction of precuneus and parietal lobe, as well as at the occipital cortex. the findings support the hypothesis that the systematic increase of minimal values of vtc concomitant with modulation of eeg signals at the frontal-central and parietal–occipital areas serve collectively to predict the future instability in posture.  this study investigated the hypothesis that virtual time-to-contact, which specifies the time to reach the functional stability boundary, is a variable controlled in the maintenance of upright posture. three different levels of support surface compliance were used on a force platform (no foam, 5 cm of foam, and 15 cm of foam). the participant’s task was to stand still under each surface support condition both with and without vision. the stability boundary was determined for each set of conditions where the participant was required to lean as far as possible in all directions of the horizontal plane without losing stability. the results showed that the no vision conditions had a significantly larger center of pressure displacement than the vision conditions. no vision and increasing support surface compliance also increased the velocity of the center of pressure trajectory. the distribution of the radial displacement of the center of pressure showed relatively equal frequency over spatial location with no central tendency. the virtual time-to-contact with the stability boundary decreased as platform surface support became more compliant. furthermore, the distribution of virtual time over the effective scaling range was a power law with a larger exponent in the more unstable no vision and increasing surface foam conditions. the findings provide additional evidence for the hypothesis that virtual time-to-contact with stability boundaries is a postural control variable that is regulated rather than the preservation of minimal motion around the center of the stability region as proposed in pendulum models of posture.
our research intends to explore whether a social perspective on it business alignment can help shed light on the it value creation process by considering different facets of interpersonal linkage. in this paper, we develop a theoretical model which could be discussed at the jais workshop. further, we use some empirical data from 149 us banks in order to find first empirical evidence whether our research focus represents a promising direction. we find initial support for our main hypotheses that communication, cross-domain knowledge and mutuality among and between it and business staff significantly impact it usage and business process outcomes. the final results of our research could contribute to our understanding of how the it resource should be understood and used to measurably contribute to firm goals. the initial findings support the caveat of recent studies suggesting that informal aspects of alignment might be quite notable (e.g. chan, 2002) and show that our theoretical understanding of alignment should be extended to better incorporate social aspects of daily work life.  as interest into the nature and value of electronic data interchange (edi) within organizations continues to grow, it becomes increasingly desirable to establish a tactical linkage between the strategic value of edi and observed operational benefits. this article provides such a tactical linkage by presenting an approach to edi measurement consisting of four facets: volume, diversity, breadth, and depth of a firm's edi initiatives. each of these facets is defined and then described through its application within the contexts of seven case sites, where each case site represents a strategic business unit having a long, successful history of edi use. the article concludes with suggestions for both practice and research.
global demand for seaweed resources has increased due to their emergent use as sources of biopharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and biofuels. these high-valued products make possible the use of micropropagation techniques that may be more costly than conventional mariculture. this study reports the successful tissue culture of kappaphycus alvarezii (doty) doty ex p. c. silva and gracilaria changii (b. xia & abbott) abbott, zhang and xia. callus induction of k. alvarezii was successfully developed following an explant sterilisation protocol. callus formation and regeneration of k. alvarezii was observed in solidified provasoli’s enriched seawater medium. different culture conditions such as agar concentration, growth hormones, nutrients, irradiance and enrichment media were investigated to determine the suitable conditions for explant culture of g. changii. proliferations of adventitious shoots were induced under the most suitable culture conditions. g. changii explants were successfully cultured in airlift photo-bioreactors, with no decrease in the carbohydrate content in the g. changii explants. this micropropagation technique can provide a useful alternative system for seedling production of economically important seaweeds.  there have been limited reports on molecular sex markers for macroalgae. we report the use of random amplified polymorphic dna analysis (rapd) to identify molecular sex markers for gracilaria changii (xia et abbott) abbott, zhang et xia. two dna extraction methods were used: a modified ctab and phenol-chloroform combination method and the dneasy plant mini kit. the ctab and phenol-chloroform method gave the best yield of dna in quality and quantity and is suitable for larger-sized specimens like g. changii. sixty-nine rapd primers were screened to search for sex-linked dna markers for g. changii, and only one sex-linked marker (716 bp) was identified using opa 18. rapd was also used to investigate the molecular characteristics of the three life-stages (male, female, tetrasporophyte) of g. changii. seven (opa7, opa18, s14, s61, s64, s75 and s76) out of the 69 primers showed polymorphism and were selected for interpopulation analysis for dna isolated from 23 samples collected from morib and sungai pulai in malaysia. the combination of data produced by the seven primers generated a dendrogram that grouped the specimens into different clades according to their sex and life-stage using the unweighted pair group and arithmetic averages (upgma) method. it showed that rapd was able to differentiate tetrasporophytes, females, and males.
this paper presents two methods of large-scale recognition of planar objects with a simple representation and approximate search of local feature vectors. a central problem of the use of local feature vectors is the burden of computation and memory for finding nearest neighbors. to solve this problem, the proposed methods embody the following: (1) a simple bit representation of feature vectors and hashing enable us to fast access with less memory, (2) approximate search with query perturbation allows us to find approximate nearest neighbors efficiently. from large-scale experiments using 10,000 objects in the database and 2,000 query images, it was found that only 10‐20% of correct nearest neighbors were enough for achieving recognition rate of 98.0%. the processing time for achieving this rate was 8.3 ms / query (excluding time for feature extraction). we have also tested the scalability of a proposed method using the database of 100,000 objects and obtained the result of 92.3% accuracy in 4.5 ms /query.  stable local feature detection and representation is a fundamental component of many image registration and object recognition algorithms. mikolajczyk and schmid (june 2003) recently evaluated a variety of approaches and identified the sift [d. g. lowe, 1999] algorithm as being the most resistant to common image deformations. this paper examines (and improves upon) the local image descriptor used by sift. like sift, our descriptors encode the salient aspects of the image gradient in the feature point's neighborhood; however, instead of using sift's smoothed weighted histograms, we apply principal components analysis (pca) to the normalized gradient patch. our experiments demonstrate that the pca-based local descriptors are more distinctive, more robust to image deformations, and more compact than the standard sift representation. we also present results showing that using these descriptors in an image retrieval application results in increased accuracy and faster matching.
objective cleft surgeons often show 10 consecutive lip repairs to reduce presentation bias, however the validity remains unknown. the purpose of this study is to determine the number of consecutive cases that represent average outcomes. secondary objectives are to determine if outcomes correlate with cleft severity and to calculate interrater reliability. design consecutive preoperative and 2-year postoperative photographs of the unilateral cleft lip–nose complex were randomized and evaluated by cleft surgeons. parametric analysis was performed according to chronologic, consecutive order. the mean standard deviation over all raters enabled calculation of expected 95% confidence intervals around a mean tested for various sample sizes. setting meeting of the american cleft palate–craniofacial association in 2009. patients, participants ten senior cleft surgeons evaluated 39 consecutive lip repairs. main outcome measures preoperative severity and postoperative outcomes were evaluated using descriptive and quantitative scales. results intraclass correlation coefficients for cleft severity and postoperative evaluations were 0.65 and 0.21, respectively. outcomes did not correlate with cleft severity (p = .28). calculations for 10 consecutive cases demonstrated wide 95% confidence intervals, spanning two points on both postoperative grading scales. ninety-five percent confidence intervals narrowed within one qualitative grade (±0.30) and one point (±0.50) on the 10-point scale for 27 consecutive cases. conclusions larger numbers of consecutive cases (n > 27) are increasingly representative of average results, but less practical in presentation format. ten consecutive cases lack statistical support. cleft surgeons showed low interrater reliability for postoperative assessments, which may reflect personal bias when evaluating another surgeon's results.  the outcomes of a consecutive series of 10 adults who had unilateral cleft lip and palate and who had undergone le fort i advancement fixed with miniplates were investigated. the amount and timing of horizontal and vertical relapse, the correlation between advancement and relapse, and the effectiveness of various methods of internal fixation were analyzed with respect to the authors' clinical experience and the data from the international literature. tracings of the preoperative and serial postoperative lateral cephalograms--taken immediately and during the 1 1/2 to 2 postoperative years--were analyzed to calculate horizontal and vertical maxillary change. we found that the use of rigid fixation is associated with a significantly more stable postoperative result, as described by other authors. our study suggests that this useful technique does not eliminate but reduces and controls the problem of relapse in a series of unilateral cleft lip and palate adult patients undergoing le fort i osteotomy.
delay tolerant networks (dtns) are usually in- termittently connected mobile wireless networks. routing in delay tolerant networks is challenging because many well-known assumptions of traditional networks do not hold in dtns. various routing schemes have been proposed in literature which exploit redundancy to improve the message delivery. however, there lacks a systematical analytic work on modeling the redundancy- based routing schemes for delay tolerant networks. this mo- tivates us to develop a unified model to analyze the various redundancy-based routing schemes. in this paper, we model the message delivering process in dtns as a continuous time markov random process with absorbing state. with this model, we have derived the probability distribution functions of the message delivery delay for different routing schemes, including direct transmission routing, source forward, and binary forward schemes. we conduct simulations to validate our model and our analytic results. the simulations show that our model can precisely capture the characteristics of those redundancy-based routing schemes.  intermittently connected mobile networks are wireless networks where most of the time there does not exist a complete path from the source to the destination. there are many real networks that fall into this paradigm, for example, wildlife tracking sensor networks, military networks, inter-planetary networks, etc. in this context, conventional routing schemes would fail. to deal with such networks researchers have suggested to use flooding-based routing schemes. while floodingbased schemes have a high probability of delivery, they waste a lot of energy and suffer from severe contention which can significantly degrade their performance. with this in mind, we introduce a new routing scheme, called spray and wait, that “sprays” a number of copies into the network, and then “waits” till one of these nodes meets the destination. we compare this scheme to a number of different routing algorithms including an oracle-based optimal algorithm that minimizes average message delivery delay while using the lowest possible number of transmissions. theory and simulations show that spray and wait has a number of desirable properties: it is very simple to implement, it is highly scalable, it performs close to the optimal scheme, and quite surprisingly, it outperforms all existing schemes with respect to both average message delivery delay and number of transmissions per message delivered.
cortical tubers are very common in tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc) and widely vary in size, appearance and location. the relationship between tuber features and clinical phenotype is unclear. the aim of the study is to propose a classification of tuber types along a spectrum of severity, using magnetic resonance imaging (mri) characteristics in 35 patients with tsc and history of epilepsy, and to investigate the relationship between tuber types and genetics, as well as clinical manifestations. three types of tubers were identified based on the mri signal intensity of their subcortical white matter component. (1) tubers type a are isointense on volumetric t1 images and subtly hyperintense on t2 weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (flair); (2) type b are hypointense on volumetric t1 images and homogeneously hyperintense on t2 weighted and flair; (3) type c are hypointense on volumetric t1 images, hyperintense on t2 weighted, and heterogeneous on flair characterized by a hypointense central region surrounded by a hyperintense rim. based on the dominant tuber type present, three distinct patient groups were also identified: patients with type a tuber dominance have a milder phenotype. patients with type c tuber dominance have more mri abnormalities such as subependymal giant cell tumors, and were more likely to have an autism spectrum disorder, a history of infantile spasms, and a higher frequency of epileptic seizures, compared to patients who have a dominance in type b tubers, and especially to those with a type a dominance.  background patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and drug-resistant epilepsy may be considered candidates for epilepsy surgery. this demands the unambiguous demonstration of the epileptogenicity of one of the tubers.   objective to test whether diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging enables differentiation of epileptogenic tubers from inert ones.   methods in 4 patients with clear unifocal interictal spike activity, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were performed. apparent diffusion coefficient maps were calculated in the identified epileptogenic tuber and compared withthose in nonepileptogenic tubers and regions of normal-appearing cortex.   results a significant increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient was found in the epileptogenic tubers. furthermore, the apparent diffusion coefficient of the nonepileptogenic tubers was significantly higher than the trace apparent diffusion coefficient of regions of normal-appearing cortex.   conclusion diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging may be of clinical importance for the identification of epileptogenic tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis and intractable epilepsy.
due to its high modularity and carry-free addition, a redundant binary (rb) representation can be used when designing high performance multipliers. the conventional rb multiplier requires an additional rb partial product (rbpp) row, because an error-correcting word (ecw) is generated by both the radix-4 modified booth encoding (mbe) and the rb encoding. this incurs in an additional rbpp accumulation stage for the mbe multiplier. in this paper, a new rb modified partial product generator (rbmppg) is proposed; it removes the extra ecw and hence, it saves one rbpp accumulation stage. therefore, the proposed rbmppg generates fewer partial product rows than a conventional rb mbe multiplier. simulation results show that the proposed rbmppg based designs significantly improve the area and power consumption when the word length of each operand in the multiplier is at least 32 bits; these reductions over previous nb multiplier designs incur in a modest delay increase (approximately 5 percent). the power-delay product can be reduced by up to 59 percent using the proposed rb multipliers when compared with existing rb multipliers.  an algorithm to convert redundant number representations into conventional representations is presented. the algorithm is performed concurrently with the digit-by-digit generation of redundant forms by schemes such as srt division. it has a step delay roughly equivalent to the delay of a carry-save adder and simple implementation. the conversion scheme is applicable in arithmetic algorithms such as nonrestoring division, square root, and on-line operations in which redundantly represented results are generated in a digit-by-digit manner, from most significant to least significant.
item recommendation is a personalized ranking task. to this end, many recommender systems optimize models with pairwise ranking objectives, such as the bayesian personalized ranking (bpr). using matrix factorization (mf) - the most widely used model in recommendation - as a demonstration, we show that optimizing it with bpr leads to a recommender model that is not robust. in particular, we find that the resultant model is highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on its model parameters, which implies the possibly large error in generalization. to enhance the robustness of a recommender model and thus improve its generalization performance, we propose a new optimization framework, namely adversarial personalized ranking (apr). in short, our apr enhances the pairwise ranking method bpr by performing adversarial training. it can be interpreted as playing a minimax game, where the minimization of the bpr objective function meanwhile defends an adversary, which adds adversarial perturbations on model parameters to maximize the bpr objective function. to illustrate how it works, we implement apr on mf by adding adversarial perturbations on the embedding vectors of users and items. extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of apr - by optimizing mf with apr, it outperforms bpr with a relative improvement of 11.2% on average and achieves state-of-the-art performance for item recommendation. our implementation is available at: \urlhttps://github.com/hexiangnan/adversarial_personalized_ranking.  we present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. we describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. we give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. we experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.
this paper deals with a distributed decision procedure for determining the electricity price for a future smart grid. in order to derive the optimal regional prices and improve the convergence speed of the algorithm without private information of market players, we propose a price decision algorithm with an alternating decision making of market players. in this paper, we show that the optimal regional prices derived by using our proposed algorithm maximize the social welfare of power networks which includes profits of power consumers and power suppliers with renewable energy generators. also, we discuss the convergence property of the proposed price decision algorithm. finally, the feasibility of our proposed dynamic pricing methodology is shown with numerical simulation results.  distributed optimal power flow (opf) is a challenging non-linear, non-convex problem of central importance to the future power grid. although many approaches are currently available in the literature, these require some form of central coordination to properly work. in this paper a fully distributed and robust algorithm for opf is proposed which does not require any form of central coordination. the algorithm is based upon the alternating direction multiplier method (admm) in a form recently proposed by the author, which, in turn, builds upon the work of schizas the approach is customized as a region-based optimization procedure, and it is tested in meaningful scenarios.
abstract context. variable demographic rates can manifest themselves between habitat types in the form of source–sink dynamics where populations in sink habitats would not exist without the addition of migrants from source habitats. aims. arctic ground squirrels (urocitellus parryii pleisus (osgood, 1900)) occupy a large geographic area in northern canada and live in a variety of habitat types, including boreal forest, low-elevation meadows and alpine meadows, providing an opportunity to investigate the possible existence of source–sink dynamics. methods. we hypothesised that arctic ground squirrels in the south-western yukon exhibit demographic characteristics indicative of source–sink dynamics. boreal forest habitat could be a sink in spite of previous high squirrel densities, whereas meadows could be a source. we investigated this by mark–recapture live-trapping and radio-telemetry. key results. in the boreal forest in the kluane region, we found reduced recruitment, reduced population growth rates (λ), and reduced survivorship for radio-collared individuals that moved from low-elevation meadows into the boreal forest. there was no evidence from radio-collared juveniles of dispersal from high-density ground squirrel populations in alpine meadows down into boreal forest. conclusions. boreal forest is a sink habitat for arctic ground squirrels. source–sink dynamics observed between low-elevation meadow and boreal forest habitats appear to result from increased predation pressure in the boreal forest. the result has been a near extirpation of boreal forest arctic ground squirrels in the kluane region since 1998. implications. because the source areas of low-elevation meadows occupy only 7–9% of the lowland habitat, recolonisation of boreal forest sites has been very slow. whereas alpine populations remain high in 2011, boreal forest populations remain near zero. alpine populations do not appear to be a source for the boreal forest.  nous avons etudie les sousliks arctiques (urocitellus parryii plesius (osgood, 1900); anterieurement spermophilus parryii plesius osgood, 1900) dans trois types d'habitat distincts (la foret boreale, les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines) dans la region de kluane dans le sud-ouest du territoire du yukon, canada, de 2008 a 2010, afin de determiner si les populations de ces differents habitats presentaient des repartitions et des abondances specifiques aux habitats. on a demontre que leur abondance dans la foret boreale est synchronisee avec le cycle des lievres d'amerique (lepus americanus erxleben, 1777) dans la region a cause de leurs predateurs communs. nous avons predit que les populations dans la foret boreale devraient etre basses a cause du minimum actuel dans le cycle des lievres d'amerique, mais que les sousliks devraient etre relativement abondants dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines. les densites en fin d'ete differaient significativement entre les divers types d'habitats, avec 0,38 ± 0.13 souslik/ha (moyenne ± 1 es) dans l'habitat de foret boreale, 1,25 ± 0,22 souslik/ha dans l'habitat de prairie basse et 5,7 ± 0,22 sousliks/ha dans l'habitat de prairie alpine. en 2009, les populations ont ete extirpees de l'habitat de foret boreale, alors que les densites dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines etaient respectivement de 1,6 ± 0,34 souslik/ha et de 6,1 ± 0,7 sousliks/ha. l'absence actuelle de sousliks dans la foret boreale et la persistance des populations dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines laissent croire a l'existence d'une dynamique de type source-puits entre les types d'habitats de foret boreale et de prairie.
cardiac amyloid deposition in fmf may cause increased qt dispersion (qtd), a marker for cardiac arrhythmias. the aim of this study was to further evaluate repolarization dispersion in familial mediterranean fever (fmf) with amyloidosis. findings on 12-lead electrocardiography were compared between 18 patients with fmf-amyloidosis and 18 age- and sex-matched control subjects. repolarization and dispersion parameters were computed with designated computer software, and results of the 5 beats were subsequently averaged. there were no statistically significant differences between the groups as to average corrected qt interval length, average qtd interval, average qt corrected dispersion, or qt dispersion ratio. jt dispersion and jt corrected dispersion were also similar in both groups. in conclusion, patients with fmf-amyloidosis seem to have qt and jt dispersion parameters similar to those of healthy subjects. future research and longer follow-ups should be conducted in order to evaluate the prognostic importance of repolarization dispersion parameters in amyloidosis of fmf.  the aim of the study was to further evaluate repolarization dispersion in familial mediterranean fever (fmf). findings on 12-lead electrocardiography were compared with 32 patients with uncomplicated fmf and age- and sex-matched control subjects. all procedures followed stringent standards. repolarization and dispersion parameters were computed with designated computer software, and results of the five beats were subsequently averaged. there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in average qt and average corrected qt interval length, average qt interval dispersion, average qt corrected dispersion, or qt dispersion ratio. during 6 months of follow-up, no cases of sudden death or arrhythmia were documented in either group. patients with fmf who are continuously treated with low-dose colchicine and have not developed amyloidosis seem to have qt dispersion parameters similar to those of healthy subjects and therefore apparently have no increased risk of adverse cardiac events associated with abnormal repolarization.
we report two japanese women with androgen excess symptoms. analyses of 21-hydroxylase gene demonstrated that a 24-year-old japanese woman had a homozygous mutation of ivs2-13 a/c>g, while a 25-year-old japanese woman had a compound heterozygous mutation of i172n and e245del1nt, a novel mutation which would result in completely nonfunctional enzyme due to a frame shift. as ivs2-13 a/c>g and i172n have been classified as mutations leading to severe impairment in enzyme activity, this study not only clarified a novel mutation causing 21-hydroxylase deficiency, but also demonstrated that genotype and phenotype do not correlate well in these cases.  we determined the sequence of a mutant cyp21b gene isolated from a patient with the severe, "salt-wasting" form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency. codon 318 in this gene is changed from cag, encoding glutamine, to tag, a nonsense codon. this is predicted to result in a completely nonfunctional enzyme due to premature termination of translation. in addition, when the cloned mutant gene was transfected into mouse y1 adrenal cells, the resulting mrna levels were decreased compared with transfected normal cyp21b genes. this mutation was carried by 3 of 20 unrelated patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency alleles as determined by hybridization with a specific oligonucleotide probe. this mutation is also seen in the normal cyp21a pseudogene, so that its presence in the abnormal cyp21b gene may be the result of a gene conversion event.
purpose – the purpose of this paper is to identify the utility of web of science, scopus and google scholar as citation analysis tools for the social sciences.design/methodology/approach – the 25 most‐accessed articles in 163 social sciences journals are searched in three citation databases.findings – web of science has long been the only tool for citation analysis. scopus and google scholar, while still new to the market, are complementary to web of science and in some cases can provide a more nuanced view of the importance of scholarly articles in the social sciences.practical implications – as libraries struggle to provide the best tools to their users, they may wish to consider the freely‐available google scholar as a substitute or complement to expensive databases such as web of science and scopus.originality/value – most analyses of citation databases have focused on the sciences. because this study examined the social sciences literature, it has expanded on the research available on web of science,...  the web of science is no longer the only database which offers citation indexing of the social sciences. scopus, csa illumina and google scholar are new entrants in this market. the holdings and citation records of these four databases were assessed against two sets of data one drawn from the 2001 research assessment exercise and the other from the international bibliography of the social sciences. initially, csa illumina's coverage at journal title level appeared to be the most comprehensive. but when recall and average citation count was tested at article level and rankings extrapolated by submission frequency to individual journal titles, scopus was ranked first. when issues of functionality, the quality of record processing and depth of coverage are taken into account, scopus and web of science have a significant advantage over the other two databases. from this analysis, scopus offers the best coverage from amongst these databases and could be used as an alternative to the web of science as a tool to evaluate the research impact in the social sciences.
past studies suggested that decis ion support systems (dss ) must be an “enabling” system aiming to enhance users’ capabilities and to leverage their skills and intelligence . this suggests that users be the center of dss and users’ characteristics be an important factor of explaining their dss acceptance behavior. since dss are aimed to work in semi -structured and unstructured task environment, perceived task complexity can be used to explain users’ willingness to accept dss. further, several studies also used decision models for investigati ng users’ dss acceptance behavior. we argue that nature of dss (based on their underlying decision models) and its interaction with individual differences also play important roles on users’ dss acceptance behavior. with the conjecture that users’ dss acce ptance behavior directly affects the dss usage and dss success, our research question focuses on how do individual differences influence users’ dss acceptance behavior with consideration of task characteristics and nature of the dss . the contribution of th is paper is multifold. first, we extend the existing understanding of effects of individual differences on users’ dss acceptance behavior. second, we extend two major measurements of cognitive styles ( geft - group embedded figures test and mbti - myers -bri ggs type indicator ) for individual differences in the context of dss. third, we investigate multiple task complexities and multiple dss models. hypotheses are developed and will be tested with an experiment of 300 plus subjects.  this paper describes a microeconomic theory-based tool, called cost analysis, which can be used in mis research to develop guidance for systems analysts and information resource managers. an example of this guidance is a matrix of decision making contexts versus appropriate mis/dss support. systems analysts can use this matrix to help identify appropriate mis/dss design alternatives. information resource managers can use this matrix to help plan for the proper evolution of mis/dss support. introduction to reduce the average decision quality produced. this quality can be increased to its initial level via increased this paper describes an approach for determining what investment in mis (e.g., more sophisticated mis) and/or kind of management information systems (mis) or deciin management (e.g., spending for management training sion support systems (dss) are appropriate for various or hiring more competent managers). thus, the cost of decision making contexts. this approach, called cost producing decisions at the intitial guality level increases analysis, is useful in research developing guidance for as problem complexity increases. systems analysts choosing information support for decision makers, and in research developing guidance for alternative mis can be compared based upon the cost of information resource managers planning the mis* portproducing equal quality decison in an environment folio. one result of cost analysis is a matrix of decision described in terms of problem complexity. if the commaking contexts versus appropriate mis support. this plexity assocated with a specific context results in higher matrix can be used by systems analysts to identify viable decision production costs using one mis than that using design alternatives. the matrix can also be used by inforanother mis, then the second mis is preferred. this cost mation resource managers to identify and plan for approanalysis approach is described in greater detail below, priate changes in the firm's mis portfolio. and applied to determining appropriate mis support for contexts within the following descriptive frameworks: cost analysis maps appropriate mis support to various decision contexts based upon problem complexity, and • product life cycle the impact of complexity upon the cost of making decisions. it is hypothesized that the cost of making decisions • gorry-scott morton management planning and of a given quality increases as problem complexity control activities increases.** problem complexity is defined along four dimensions: the product life cycle framework provides a vehicle for understanding the application of cost analysis to mis • problem duration-the time allowed for problem portfolio planning. a profile of appropriate mis is develsolution oped, in accord with changing decision making contexts associated with the manufacture of products progressing • problem homogeneity-the lack of problem type through their life cycles. these changing decision convariety texts reflect changes in marketing and manufucturing strategies. the gorry-scott morton framework provides • problem predictability-the ability to forcast the an opportunity for understanding the application of cost occurrence of problems analysis to systems design. categories of appropriate mis are developed for specific management planning • problem knowledge-the understanding of the and control activities. these catagories can be used by problem; problem structure systems analysts to identify appropriate mis support of managerial activities. a decrease in any of these dimensions represents an increase in problem complexity. for example, a decrease using these two frameworks as examples also allows a in problem knowledge in a decision context is expected demonstration of support for the validity of cost analysis.
abstract in this paper, we use deep feedforward artificial neural networks to approximate solutions to partial differential equations in complex geometries. we show how to modify the backpropagation algorithm to compute the partial derivatives of the network output with respect to the space variables which is needed to approximate the differential operator. the method is based on an ansatz for the solution which requires nothing but feedforward neural networks and an unconstrained gradient based optimization method such as gradient descent or a quasi-newton method. we show an example where classical mesh based methods cannot be used and neural networks can be seen as an attractive alternative. finally, we highlight the benefits of deep compared to shallow neural networks and device some other convergence enhancing techniques.  we study a new algorithm for solving parabolic partial differential equations (pdes) and backward stochastic differential equations (bsdes) in high dimension, which is based on an analogy between the bsde and reinforcement learning with the gradient of the solution playing the role of the policy function, and the loss function given by the error between the prescribed terminal condition and the solution of the bsde. the policy function is then approximated by a neural network, as is done in deep reinforcement learning. numerical results using tensorflow illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the studied algorithm for several 100-dimensional nonlinear pdes from physics and finance such as the allen–cahn equation, the hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation, and a nonlinear pricing model for financial derivatives.
this study aimed to determine whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) variants are related to premorbid educational attainment, progression of cognitive and functional decline, and associated neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with alzheimer’s disease (ad). a sample of n = 341 ad subjects was genotyped for the bdnf polymorphisms val66met, c270t, and g-712a. subjects received tests of cognition and daily function at baseline and at multiple subsequent time points during their participation in a variety of research protocols. cognition was measured by the mini-mental state examination (mmse) and alzheimer’s disease assessment scale (adas-cog). functional performance was assessed using the instrumental activities of daily living questionnaire (iadl) as well as the alzheimer’s disease cooperative study-activities of daily living inventory (adcs-adl). subjects were also characterized for the frequency and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms using the neuropsychiatric inventory (npi). there was a significant effect of val66met genotype on educational attainment (f = 7.42, df = 2, 329, p = .00070), with met homozygotes having significantly fewer years of education than both the val/met and val/val groups. no association was observed between any bdnf polymorphism and measures of cognitive or functional decline. the c270t-t allele was associated with a higher prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (z = -2.11, n = 241, p = .035) and specifically with the presence of hallucinations (or = 3.25, 95% ci = [1.22-8.62], p = .018). in summary, the val66met polymorphism appears to be associated with lower premorbid educational attainment in ad patients. the c270t-t allele demonstrated association with total neuropsychiatric symptoms and specifically hallucinations. bdnf genotypes in this sample do not confer a more rapid rate of cognitive or functional decline. acknowledgements i am indebted to dr. christopher van dyck for his mentorship. i would like to thank the researchers of the alzheimer’s disease research unit (adru) – dr. martha macavoy, benjamin black, traci frye, patricia hoffman, tracy rightmer, nicole salamon black, kristina reech, and timothy kleiman – whose work provided the foundation for the psychometric database compiled for this analysis. genotyping was overseen by drs. joel gelernter, fatih ozbay, huiping zhang, and jaakko lappalainen. thanks to ann marie lacobelle for technical assistance. this research was supported in part by nih clinical neuroscience mental health research training grant, as well as k24-da15105 (jg), and p30mh30929. table of  a functional polymorphism in the coding region of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) gene (196 a/g, met66val) has recently been reported to be associated with alzheimer's disease (ad) and with an overrepresentation of g allele in ad patients, but different results have also been presented. we conducted a case-control study to analyze the association between the bdnf a/g polymorphism and sporadic ad in a sample composed of 203 ad patients and 239 controls from mainland chinese han population. no association between the polymorphism and ad, no association between the polymorphism and age at onset in ad, and no significant interaction between bdnf and apolipoprotein e (apoe) genotype were detected in either the total or the male samples. however, a significantly high frequency of the gg genotype in the female controls compared with the female patients was detected. a postponed age at onset in the female patients with the gg genotype was also observed. these results suggest that the gg genotype has a protection effect from ad development in females. a significant low frequency of ad patients with the bdnf gg genotype in the ad apoeepsilon4 carriers compared with the frequency of the controls with the bdnf gg genotype in the control apoeepsilon4 carriers was also detected in the female individuals, suggesting that the bdnf gg genotype may reduce the effect of apoeepsilon4 on ad risk in females. additionally, low frequencies of bdnf g allele and gg genotype were revealed in chinese when compared with that in the other race populations so far reported.
introduction:  targeted intrathecal drug infusion to treat moderate to severe chronic pain has become a standard part of treatment algorithms when more conservative options fail. this therapy is well established in the literature, has shown efficacy, and is an important tool for the treatment of both cancer and noncancer pain; however, it has become clear in recent years that intrathecal drug delivery is associated with risks for serious morbidity and mortality.  objectives:the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intrathecal narcotics pump (itnp) as an alternative treatment for patients with pain from chronic pancreatitis (cp). itnp offers the advantages of reversibility, lower total narcotic dose, and the pancreas remaining intact.methods:thirteen patients (8 female, 5 male), with mean age 40.6 years (s.d. 9.6 years), who had experienced intractable upper abdominal pain from cp were reviewed. each patient had multiple other failed treatment modalities, including partial pancreatic resection (n=6). they were offered itnp after a successful intraspinal opioid trial. etiologies of cp included idiopathy (n=3), cystic fibrosis (n=2), alcohol (n=2), and pancreas divisum (n=6).results:the median duration of severe, intractable pain prior to itnp was 6 years (2–22 years). the median follow-up time after itnp was 29 months (range, 7–94 months). the itnp was in situ for a mean duration of 29 months (range, 0.5–94 months). seven patients had pump exchange or removal for various reasons; improvement of pain at month 53 (n=1), meningitis (n=1), meningitis with subsequent replacement (n=1), pump failure at month 31, 68, 79, and 84 (n=4). there were no deaths. the mean pain score prior to implantation (score=8.3, s.d.=0.9) was significantly higher than 1 year after (score=2.7, s.d.=1.9) (p<0.01) and last follow-up (score=0.75, s.d.=2.1) (p<0.01). the median oral narcotic dose before and 1 year after itnp were morphine sulfate equivalents 337.5 mg per day (range, 67.5–1,320) and 40 mg per day (range, 0–1,680), respectively (p<0.01). two patients were considered failures, as they still require a high dosage of both oral and intrathecal medications to control their pain, despite significant pain-score improvement. one patient who was excluded due to meningitis was also considered a failure. therefore, the overall success rate of itnp based on an intention-to-treat analysis was 76.9% (10/13). the major complications of itnp were central nervous system infection requiring pump removal (n=1), cerebrospinal fluid leak requiring laminectomy (n=1), and perispinal abscess with bacterial meningitis requiring pump removal (n=1).conclusions:this study shows the many risks and benefits of itnp. a longer follow-up is awaited; such pumps appear to be one alternative to aggressive surgical intervention. failed itnp trials leave other options open. therapeutic trials directly comparing pancreatectomy, itnp, and implanted nerve stimulators are of interest.
it is unknown if a sex difference exists in cardiac apamin‐sensitive small conductance ca2+‐activated k+ (sk) current (ikas). there is no sex difference in ikas in the basal condition. however, there is larger ikas in female rabbit ventricles than in male during isoproterenol infusion. ikas activation by isoproterenol leads to action potential triangulation in females, indicating its abundant activation at early phases of repolarization. ikas activation in females induces negative ca2+–voltage coupling and promotes electromechanically discordant phase 2 repolarization alternans. ikas is important in the mechanisms of ventricular fibrillation in females during sympathetic stimulation.  a mathematical model of a small conductance ca2+‐activated potassium (sk) channel was developed and incorporated into a physiologically detailed ventricular myocyte model. ca2+‐sensitive k+ currents promote negative intracellular ca2+ to membrane voltage (cai2+→ vm) coupling. increase of ca2+‐sensitive k+ currents can be responsible for electromechanically discordant alternans and quasiperiodic oscillations at the cellular level. at the tissue level, turing‐type instability can occur when ca2+‐sensitive k+ currents are increased.
objectives low back pain after load-carrying is the most important disorder in musculoskeletal system and a cause of dysfunction and economic problems. holding materials can disturb spinal stability; nevertheless, there are few researches about the pattern of trunk muscle recruitment in patients with chronic low back pain (clbp) during load holding.   methods ten female patients with clbp and ten matched healthy subjects participated in this study. normalized electromyography activation of trunk muscles during holding loads was analyzed.   results the low back pain group demonstrated significantly higher activation levels of the external oblique abdominis muscle during loading 12 kg in flexed trunk position and lower activation levels of the internal oblique abdominis muscle during loading 6 and 12 kg in neutral trunk position than the control group. with the highest external load and trunk flexion, the electrical activity of back muscles increased significantly in both groups. with increasing load, the activation of rectus abdominis muscle in patients with clbp and the activation of rectus abdominis and internal oblique muscles were increased significantly in healthy subjects.   conclusion higher activation of global and lower activation of local abdominal muscles in patients with clbp may represent that pain changes neuromuscular control systems. the increased activity of extensor muscles during trunk flexion is probably needed for stability and controlling of flexion.  stability of the lumbar spine is an important factor in determining spinal response to sudden loading. using two different methods, this study evaluated how various trunk load magnitudes and directions affect lumbar spine stability. the first method was a quick release procedure in which effective trunk stiffness and stability were calculated from trunk kinematic response to a resisted-force release. the second method combined trunk muscle emg data with a biomechanical model to calculate lumbar spine stability. twelve subjects were tested in trunk flexion, extension, and lateral bending under nine permutations of vertical and horizontal trunk loading. the vertical load values were set at 0, 20, and 40% of the subject's body weight (bw). the horizontal loads were 0, 10, and 20% of bw. effective spine stability as obtained from quick release experimentation increased significantly (p<0.01) with increased vertical and horizontal loading. it ranged from 785 (s.d.=580) nm/rad under no-load conditions to 2200 (s.d.=1015) nm/rad when the maximum horizontal and vertical loads were applied to the trunk simultaneously. stability of the lumbar spine achieved prior to force release and estimated from the biomechanical model explained approximately 50% of variance in the effective spine stability obtained from quick release trials in extension and lateral bending (0.53<r(2)<0.63). there was no such correlation in flexion trials. it was concluded that lumbar spine stability increased with increased trunk load magnitude to the extent that this load brought about an increase in trunk muscle activation. indirectly, our data suggest that muscle reflex response to sudden loading can augment the lumbar spine stability level achieved immediately prior to the sudden loading event.
human activities such as fragmentation and selective logging of forests can threaten population viability by modification of ecological and genetic processes. using six microsatellite markers, we examined the effects of forest fragmentation and local disturbance on the genetic diversity and structure of adult trees (n = 110) and seedlings (n = 110) of prunus africana in kakamega forest, western kenya. taking samples of adults and seedlings allowed for study of changes in genetic diversity and structure between generations. thereby, adults reflect the pattern before and seedlings after intensive human impact. overall, we found 105 different alleles in the six loci examined, 97 in adults and 88 in seedlings. allelic richness and heterozygosity were significantly lower in seedlings than in adults. inbreeding increased from adult tree to seedling populations. genetic differentiation of adult trees was low (overall fst = 0.032), reflecting large population sizes and extensive gene flow in the past. genetic differentiation of seedlings was slightly higher (overall fst = 0.044) with all of the 28 pairwise fst-values being significantly different from zero. these results suggest that human disturbance in kakamega forest has significantly reduced allelic richness and heterozygosity, increased inbreeding and slightly reduced gene flow in p. africana in the past 80–100 years.  i reexamine the use of isolation by distance models as a basis for the estimation of demographic parameters from measures of population subdivision. to that aim, i first provide results for values of f-statistics in one-dimensional models and coalescence times in two-dimensional models, and make more precise earlier results for f-statistics in two-dimensional models and coalescence times in one-dimensional models. based on these results, i propose a method of data analysis involving the regression of fst/(1-fst) estimates for pairs of subpopulations on geographic distance for populations along linear habitats or logarithm of distance for populations in two-dimensional habitats. this regression provides in principle an estimate of the product of population density and second moment of parental axial distance. in two cases where comparison to direct estimates is possible, the method proposed here is more satisfactory than previous indirect methods.
abstract the 5′ utr of coxsackievirus b3 (cvb3) contains internal ribosome entry site (ires), which allows cap-independent translation of the viral rna and a 5′-terminal cloverleaf structure that regulates viral replication, translation and stability. here, we demonstrate that host protein psf (ptb associated splicing factor) interacts with the cloverleaf rna as well as the ires element. psf was found to be an important ires trans acting factor (itaf) for efficient translation of cvb3 rna. interestingly, cytoplasmic abundance of psf protein increased during cvb3 infection and this is regulated by phosphorylation status at two different amino acid positions. further, psf protein was up-regulated in cvb3 infection. the expression of cvb3–2a protease alone could also induce increased psf protein levels. furthermore, we observed the presence of an ires element in the 5′utr of psf mrna, which is activated during cvb3 infection and might contribute to the elevated levels of psf. it appears that psf ires is also positively regulated by ptb, which is known to regulate cvb3 ires. taken together, the results suggest for the first time a novel mechanism of regulations of itafs during viral infection, where an itaf undergoes ires mediated translation, sustaining its protein levels under condition of translation shut-off.  poliovirus protease 2a (2apro) obstructs host gene expression by reprogramming transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory events during infection. here we demonstrate that expression of 2apro induces a selective nucleo-cytoplasm translocation of several important rna binding proteins and splicing factors. subcellular fractionation studies, together with immunofluorescence microscopy revealed an asymmetric distribution of hur and tia1/tiar in 2apro expressing cells, which modulates splicing of the human fas exon 6. consistent with this result, knockdown of hur or overexpression of tia1/tiar, leads to fas exon 6 inclusion in 2apro-expressing cells. therefore, poliovirus 2apro can target alternative pre-mrna splicing by regulating protein shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
increasing concern from the public about the safety of genetically modified food has made critical to have suitable methods for recognizing associated potential hazards. hierarchical approaches to allergenicity determination were proposed, and these include evaluation of the structural and sequence homology and serological identity of novel proteins with existing allergens, measuring the resistance to proteolytic digestion and assessment of sensitizing potential using animal models. allergic individuals have a predisposed (i.e. atopic) genetic background, and a close resemblance to this setup is therefore desirable in animal models, which is possible by using a strain of an animal species that is prone for allergic disorders. so far, none of the animal model has been validated for the purpose of hazard identification in the context of safety assessment. however, the available knowledge suggests that the judicious use of an appropriate animal model could provide important information about the allergic potential of novel proteins. this paper provides an up-to-date review of the progress made in the field of development of in vivo models in this direction and the further goals that have to be achieved.  discredited a few years ago, active suppression is now commonly considered as a key mechanism avoiding auto-reactivity and development of potentially harmful immune responses, and in some circumstances, as an obstacle to successful vaccination. a large quantity of literature identifies naturally occurring cd4+cd25+ t cells as key suppressor cells involved in the control of many pathophysiological diseases. manipulation of these cells and control of their function offers new perspectives for the treatment of auto-immune and inflammatory diseases and enhancement of vaccine efficacy. such clinical interventions require a better understanding of the conditions of expansion/activation of cd4+cd25+ t cells and deciphering of their mechanism of suppression, which remains incomplete and sometimes controversial.
our goal is to introduce and describe the utility of a new pipeline “contigs assembly pipeline using reference genome” (caprg), which has been developed to assemble “long sequence reads” for non-model organisms by leveraging a reference genome of a closely related phylogenetic relative. to facilitate this effort, we utilized two avian transcriptomic datasets generated using roche/454 technology as test cases for caprg assembly. we compared the results of caprg assembly using a reference genome with the results of existing methods that utilize de novo strategies such as velvet, pave, and mira by employing parameter space comparisons (intra-assembling comparison). caprg performed as well or better than the existing assembly methods based on various benchmarks for “gene-hunting.” further, caprg completed the assemblies in a fraction of the time required by the existing assembly algorithms. additional advantages of caprg included reduced contig inflation resulting in lower computational resources for annotation, and functional identification for contigs that may be categorized as “unknowns” by de novo methods. in addition to providing evaluation of caprg performance, we observed that the different assembly (inter-assembly) results could be integrated to enhance the putative gene coverage for any transcriptomics study.  we have developed a new set of algorithms, collectively called "velvet," to manipulate de bruijn graphs for genomic sequence assembly. a de bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) that is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25-50 bp) data sets. applying velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb n50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb n50 on simulated mammalian bacs. when applied to real solexa data sets without read pairs, velvet generated contigs of approximately 8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian bac, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.
the current study examined whether video game training would help improve divided attention skills among older adults. twenty-nine (4 males, 25 females) participants aged 50 to 84 years (m = 70) were tested for their skills of divided attention using a memory and reaction time task. participants were randomly allocated to the experimental group and control group and only those in the experimental group trained with the computer game, pac-man adventures in time for three hours. results show that three hours of training are not sufficient to enhance skills of divided attention amongst older adults as the differences in these skills were not significantly different between control and experimental groups. these findings suggest that greater amounts or other methods of training may be required to enhance older adults’ ability to perform dual tasks.  the authors examined the effects of divided attention (da) at encoding and retrieval in free recall, cued recall, and recognition memory in 4 experiments. lists of words or word pairs were presented auditorily and recalled orally; the secondary task was a visual continuous reaction-time (rt) task with manual responses. at encoding, da was associated with large reductions in memory performance, but small increases in rt; trade-offs between memory and rt were under conscious control. in contrast, da at retrieval resulted in small or no reductions in memory, but in comparatively larger increases in rt, especially in free recall. memory performance was sensitive to changes in task emphasis at encoding but not at retrieval. the results are discussed in terms of controlled and automatic processes and speculatively linked to underlying neuropsychological mechanisms.
this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study investigated the effect of blackcurrant anthocyanin (bca) intake on peripheral circulation during rest and during typing work by using near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs), and it also assessed improvement in shoulder stiffness caused by poor local circulation. in a resting circulation study, nine healthy male subjects took capsules of bca at a dosage of 17 mg kg−1 or placebo (isoenergetic sugar). nirs was used to measure left forearm blood flow (fbf) following venous occlusion and muscle oxygen consumption following arterial occlusion prior to and hourly for 4 h after ingestion of bca. plasma anthocyanin concentration was measured prior to ingestion and 1, 2, and 4 h later. fbf increased significantly 2 h after bca ingestion [bca 1.22 (0.13)-fold increase relative to pre-values vs placebo 0.83 (0.06) of pre-values; p<0.05] and then tended to increase for a further 3 h after ingestion [bca 1.26 (0.15)-fold increase relative to pre-values vs placebo 0.82 (0.07) of pre-values; p=0.078]. there was, however, no significant difference in muscle oxygen consumption between bca and placebo intake at any time point. in a typing work study, 11 healthy subjects took capsules of bca (7.7 mg kg−1) or placebo (isoenergetic sugar) daily for 2 weeks. the subjects then performed intermittent typing workload for 30 min in order to induce acute shoulder stiffness. during the workload, total hemoglobin and oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-hb) were determined using nirs and myoelectric signals measured in the right trapezius muscle using electromyography (emg). the viscoelasticity of the trapezius muscle was also evaluated using a muscle stiffness meter before and after the typing workload. bca intake prevented the decrease in oxy-hb significantly (p<0.05), and also tended to alleviate the increase in root mean square (rms) of the emg during the typing workload, and also muscle stiffness after the workload. there was no improvement in typing performance with bca intake. the results of this study suggest that intake of bca may improve shoulder stiffness caused by typing work by increasing peripheral blood flow and reducing muscle fatigue.  abstract we have investigated the etiology of lower-back muscle fatigue using simultaneous recordings of electromyography (emg), mechanomyography (mmg), and near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) in an attempt to shed some light on the electrophysiological, mechanical, and metabolic characteristics, respectively. eight male subjects performed isometric back extensions at an angle of 15° with reference to the horizontal plane, for a period of 60 s. surface emg, mmg and nirs signals were recorded simultaneously from the center of the erector spinae at the level of l3. nirs was measured to determine the level of muscle blood volume (bv) and oxygenation (oxy-hb). the root mean square amplitude value (rms) of the emg signal was significantly increased at the initial phase of contraction and then fell significantly, while mean power frequency (mpf) of the emg signal decreased significantly and progressively as a function of time. there were also significant initial increases in rms-mmg that were followed by progressive decreases at the end of fatiguing contractions. mpf-mmg remained unchanged. muscle bv and oxy-hb decreased dramatically at the onset of the contraction and then remained almost constant throughout the rest of the contraction. these results, obtained by simultaneous recordings of emg, mmg, and nirs, demonstrate that the restriction of blood flow due to high intramuscular mechanical pressure is one of the most important factors in muscle fatigue in the lower-back muscles. in addition, the simultaneous recording system described here can be used to obtain more reliable information regarding the mechanism(s) of lower-back muscle fatigue.
highlights • the infant brain is sensitive to gentle skin stroking within the first weeks of age.• the postcentral gyrus and posterior insular cortex are responsive to stroking.• social touch activates both somatosensory and socio-affective brain areas in infancy.  the multimodal properties of the human somatosensory system continue to be unravelled. there is mounting evidence that one of these submodalities-touch-has another dimension, providing not only its well-recognized discriminative input to the brain, but also an affective input. it has long been recognized that touch plays an important role in many forms of social communication and a number of theories have been proposed to explain observations and beliefs about the "power of touch." here, we propose that a class of low-threshold mechanosensitive c fibers that innervate the hairy skin represent the neurobiological substrate for the affective and rewarding properties of touch.
study aimed to determine the rate and prediction of infection in diabetes mellitus patients ≥18 year, with diabetic ketoacidosis (dka). retrospective cohort study design was adopted to achieve the objectives. universal sampling technique was employed for data collection among diabetes ketoacidosis patients, over a period of 3 years (jan 2008-dec 2010). statistical package for social sciences used to analyze data. over a 3-year period, total of 967 admissions were identified. of it, 112 (11.6%) with no infection, 679 (70.2%) with bacterial infection and 176 (18.2%) with presumed viral infection. the mean wbc for all the patients was 18,177 (±9431). 721 (74.6%) had leukocytosis, as defined by a wbc ≥ 15,000/mm3. wbc, differential, leukocytosis, as well as sex, temperature were not significant predictors (p > 0.05) of bacterial infection. there was significant (p < 0.05) difference of age between the 3 groups, age above 57 years have high rate of infection as compared to age below and equal 57 years. the infection rate in elderly patients with dka was high and majority of them had lack of clinical evidence. major bacterial infections with potential serious sequel were particularly common (33.3%), among every third patient being presumed to have serious consequences.  diabetic ketoacidosis (dka) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (tidm). mortality is predominantly related to the occurrence of cerebral oedema; only a minority of deaths in dka are attributed to other causes. cerebral oedema occurs in about 0.3–1% of all episodes of dka, and its aetiology, pathophysiology, and ideal method of treatment are poorly understood. there is debate as to whether physicians treating dka can prevent or predict the occurrence of cerebral oedema, and the appropriate site(s) for children with dka to be managed. there is agreement that prevention of dka and reduction of its incidence should be a goal in managing children with diabetes.
we tested between two coding mechanisms that the brain may use to retain distance information about a target for a reaching movement across vergence eye movements. if the brain was to encode a retinal disparity representation (retinal model), i.e., target depth relative to the plane of fixation, each vergence eye movement would require an active update of this representation to preserve depth constancy. alternatively, if the brain was to store an egocentric distance representation of the target by integrating retinal disparity and vergence signals at the moment of target presentation, this representation should remain stable across subsequent vergence shifts (nonretinal model). we tested between these schemes by measuring errors of human reaching movements (n = 14 subjects) to remembered targets, briefly presented before a vergence eye movement. for comparison, we also tested their directional accuracy across version eye movements. with intervening vergence shifts, the memory-guided reaches showed an error pattern that was based on the new eye position and on the depth of the remembered target relative to that position. this suggests that target depth is recomputed after the gaze shift, supporting the retinal model. our results also confirm earlier literature showing retinal updating of target direction. furthermore, regression analyses revealed updating gains close to one for both target depth and direction, suggesting that the errors arise after the updating stage during the subsequent reference frame transformations that are involved in reaching.  an experiment investigated in human adults the sensorimotor transformation involved in pointing to a spatial target identified previously by kinesthetic cues. in the “locating phase,” a computer-controlled mechanical arm guided the left [condition lr (left–right)] or right [condition rr (right–right)] finger of the blindfolded participant to one of 27 target positions. in the subsequent “pointing phase,” the participant tried to reach the same position with the right finger. the final finger position and the posture of the arm were measured in both conditions. constant errors were large but consistent and remarkably similar across conditions, suggesting that, whatever the locating hand, target position is coded in an extrinsic frame of reference (target position hypothesis). the main difference between the same-hand (rr) and different-hand (lr) conditions was a symmetric shift of the pattern of endpoints with respect to the midsagittal plane. this effect was modeled accurately by assuming a systematic bias in the perception of the postural angles of the locating arm. the analysis of the variable errors indicated that target position is represented internally in a spherical coordinate system centered on the shoulder of the pointing arm and that the main source of variability is within the planning stage of the pointing movement. locating and pointing postures depended systematically on target position. we tested qualitatively the hypothesis that the selection of both postures (inverse kinematic problem) is constrained by a minimum-distance principle. in condition rr, pointing posture depended also on the locating posture, implying the presence of a memory trace of the previous movement. a scheme is suggested to accommodate the results within an extended version of the target position hypothesis.
bimetallic au-pd nanoparticles supported on tio2 have shown excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzaldehyde in the solvent-free transformation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, where toluene is the main observed by-product, together with smaller amounts of benzoic acid, benzyl benzoate and dibenzyl ether. however, despite the industrial relevance of this reaction and importance of tuning the selectivity to the desired benzaldehyde, only a few attempts have been made in the literature on modeling the reaction kinetics for a quantitative description of this reaction system. a kinetic model for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol over au-pd is proposed in this paper. it has been found satisfactory after a model discrimination procedure has been applied to a number of simplified candidate models developed from microkinetic studies. despite its relative simplicity, the proposed model is capable of representing the reactant conversion and distribution of products observed in experiments carried out at different temperature, pressure and catalyst mass in a stirred batch reactor. major findings included the quantitative evaluation of the impact of hydrogenolysis and disproportionation pathways on benzaldehyde production. at low temperature the disproportionation reaction was the dominant route to toluene formation, while hydrogenolysis dominated at high temperature.  in the solvent free oxidation of benzyl alcohol, using supported gold-palladium nanoalloys, toluene is often one of major by-products and it is formed by the disproportionation of benzyl alcohol. gold-palladium catalysts on acidic supports promote both the disproportionation of benzyl alcohol and oxidative dehydrogenation to form benzaldehyde. basic supports completely switch off disproportionation and the gold-palladium nanoparticles catalyse the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction exclusively. in an attempt to provide further details on the course of these reactions, we have utilized in situ atr-ir, in situ drift and inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopic methods, and in this article we present the results of these in situ spectroscopic studies.
backgroundwalking, a closed kinetic chain (ckc) activity, is widely used in knee rehabilitation as it allows early weight bearing and movement. it has been suggested that retro-walking may provide additional benefits beyond those experienced by forward-walking. the present study will investigate the effect of retro- and forward-walking on quadriceps muscle strength, pain, function, balance and mobility in knee osteoarthritis (oa) subjects.methods/designsixty-nine participants with knee oa will be recruited from the outpatient department in this randomized controlled trial. the participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups; retro walking, forward walking or control group. the training program will be 3 days/week for 6 weeks. in addition, all the participants will receive a standard physiotherapy training program. an independent assessor blinded to group assignment will measure quadriceps muscle strength, knee pain intensity, functional disability, and mobility at baseline and 6 weeks after training.discussionthe results of this study will enhance our understanding on the therapeutic effects of walking (retro- or forward-walking) in knee oa. the findings from this study will help determine whether retro- or forward-walking or both are effective in the rehabilitation of subjects with knee oa.trial registrationcontrolled trials isrctn12850845, registered 26 january 2015.  background: increased external knee adduction moment during walking alters the joint biomechanics; which causes symptoms in chronic knee osteoarthritis patients. aims: to assess additional effects of retro-walking over conventional treatment on pain and disability in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic knee osteoarthritis. materials and methods: thirty chronic knee osteoarthritis patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups. group ‘a’ (7 men, 8 women) received conventional treatment. group ‘b’ (8 men, 7 women) received conventional treatment and retro-walking. pain, assessed through visual analogue scale (vas), and western ontario and mcmaster universities arthritis index (womac) were the primary outcomes and knee range of motion (rom), hip abductor and extensor strength were secondary outcomes; measured pre-intervention, after 1 week and after 3 weeks of intervention. results: two factors analysis of variance for repeated measures was used for all outcomes. at the end of 3 weeks; womac score showed highly significant difference within (p < 0.0001) and significant difference between groups (p = 0.040) also by time × group interaction (p = 0.024), vas showed highly significant difference within groups (p < 0.0001). knee rom showed significant difference within groups. hip abductor and extensor strength showed significant difference by time × group interaction (p < 0.05). conclusion: retrowalking is an effective adjunct to conventional treatment in decreasing disability in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
conventional pcr methods combined with linkage analysis based on short tandem repeats (strs) or karyomapping with single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) arrays, have been applied to preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) for spinal muscular atrophy (sma), an autosome recessive disorder. however, it has limitations in sma diagnosis by karyomapping, and these methods are unable to distinguish wild-type embryos with carriers effectively. mutated allele revealed by sequencing with aneuploidy and linkage analyses (marsala) is a new method allowing embryo selection by a one-step next-generation sequencing (ngs) procedure, which has been applied in pgd for both autosome dominant and x-linked diseases in our group previously. in this study, we carried out pgd based on marsala for two carrier families with sma affected children. as a result, one of the couples has given birth to a healthy baby free of mutations in sma-causing gene. it is the first time that marsala was applied to pgd for sma, and we can distinguish the embryos with heterozygous deletion (carriers) from the wild-type (normal) ones accurately through this ngs-based method. in addition, direct mutation detection allows us to identify the affected embryos (homozygous deletion), which can be regarded as probands for linkage analysis, in case that the affected family member is absent. in the future, the ngs-based marsala method is expected to be used in pgd for all monogenetic disorders with known pathogenic gene mutation.  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (pgd) is well established method for treatment of genetic problems associated with infertility. moreover, pgd with next-generation sequencing (ngs) provide new possibilities for diagnosis and new parameters for evaluation in, for example, aneuploidy screening. the aim of the study was to report the successful pregnancy outcome following pgd with ngs as the method for 24 chromosome aneuploidy screening in the case of robertsonian translocation. day 3 embryos screening for chromosomal aneuploidy was performed in two consecutive in vitro fertilization (ivf) cycles, first with fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), and then with ngs-based protocol. in each ivf attempt, three embryos were biopsied. short duration of procedures enabled fresh embryo transfer without the need for vitrification. first ivf cycle with the embryo selected using pgd analysis with the fish method ended with pregnancy loss in week 8. the second attempt with ngs-based aneuploidy screening led to exclusion of the following two embryos: one embryo with 22 monosomy and one with multiple aneuploidies. the transfer of the only euploid blastocyst resulted in the successful pregnancy outcome. the identification of the euploid embryo based on the ngs application was the first successful clinical application of ngs-based pgd in the case of the robertsonian translocation carrier couple.
during competitions, elite cross-country skiers produce higher external work rates on uphill than on flat terrain. however, it is not presently known whether this reflects solely higher energy expenditure. furthermore, the kinematic factors associated with these higher rates of uphill work have not yet been examined. therefore, in the present investigation the work rate and associated kinematic parameters at similar metabolic rates during roller ski skating on flat and uphill terrains have been compared. seven elite male skiers performed six 5-min sub-maximal exercise bouts at the same low, moderate and high metabolic rates on 2 and 8% inclines, while roller skiing on a treadmill employing the g3 skating technique. the work rate was calculated as work against gravity and friction, whereas the energetic equivalent of vo2 was taken as the metabolic rate. gross efficiency was defined as work rate divided by metabolic rate. kinematic parameters were analyzed in three dimensions. at the same metabolic rate, the work rate, cycle rate, work per cycle and relative duration of propulsive phases during a cycle of movement were all higher on the 8% than on the 2% incline at all speeds (all p < 0.05). at similar work rates, gross efficiency was greater on the 8% incline (p < 0.05). in conclusion, these elite skiers consistently demonstrated higher work rates on the 8% incline. to achieve the higher work rates on the steeper incline, these elite skiers employed higher cycle rates and performed more work per cycle, in association with a longer relative propulsive phase.  objective to examine the effect of an increase in roller ski rolling resistance on the physiological and upper body demands of roller skiing with the v2-alternate technique.   methods nine highly skilled cross-country skiers roller skied at three paced speeds on a flat oval loop using roller skis with high (hir) and low (lowr) rolling resistance. oxygen uptake (vo2), heart rate, and poling forces were measured during the last 30 s and rating of perceived exertion (rpe) was requested immediately after each 4-min bout of roller skiing.   results vo2 and all force-related variables increased significantly with speed and were higher (p < 0.01) for hir at given speeds. poling time was similar between hir and lowr, whereas poling recovery time was shorter (p = 0.0002) and cycle rate was higher (p = 0.002) for hir. for given vo2 levels, peak and average forces, heart rates, and rpe values were similar between hir and lowr, whereas average poling force across the cycle was greater (p = 0.006) and duty cycle (i.e., percentage of cycle when poling forces were applied) was higher (p = 0.0001) with hir.   conclusions 1) the decrease in poling recovery time and increase in cycle rate associated with an increase in roller ski rolling resistance is comparable to the effect previously observed from increasing grade and probably occurs as a means of limiting deceleration. 2) since changes in rolling resistance do not alter the relationships of rpe and heart rate with vo2, the central cardiovascular adaptations from roller ski training should not be affected by the rolling resistance of the roller skis. 3) higher resistance roller skis are likely to induce greater upper body aerobic adaptations than lower resistance roller skis.
using a bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) library, we analysed a 99.5 kb genomic segment containing the major histocompatibility class ii genes of a teleost, the three-spined stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus. experiments with g. aculeatus have provided direct evidence for balancing selection by pathogens and mate choice driving mh class ii beta polymorphism. two sets of paralogous class ii alpha genes and beta genes in a tandem arrangement were identified, designated gaac-daa/dab and gaac-dba/dbb. expression analysis of the beta genes using single-strand conformation polymorphism revealed that both gene copies are expressed. based on an analysis of pairwise nucleotide polymorphisms, we estimate that the duplication into two paralogous class ii loci occurred only 1.2–2.4 million years ago, 1–2 orders of magnitude more recently than in other fish, bird or mammalian species. at the 3′-direction of the classical mh loci, we identified another seven genes or gene fragments, two of which (small inducible cytokine, complement regulatory factor) are related to immune function in other vertebrates. none of these genes were associated with mh class ii genes in zebrafish, suggesting a markedly different organisation of the mh class ii region in sticklebacks, and presumably, across bony fishes. when the nucleotide substitution pattern of the novel class ii beta genes was analysed together with a representative sequence sample isolated from fish in northern germany (n=27), we found that the peptide binding region of the gaac-dab and gaac-dbb loci had undergone an inter-locus gene conversion (p=0.007). in accordance, we found a 10- to 20-fold higher frequency of cpg-islands on the mh class ii segment compared to other species, a feature that may be conducive for inter-locus recombination.  we have tested the importance of genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class iib in atlantic salmon (salmo salar) for survival after challenge with a highly virulent bacterial pathogen. forty juvenile full siblings from each of 120 families were infected with the bacterium aeromonas salmonicida, which causes high mortality in salmon due to furunculosis. fishes from high–resistance (hr, < 35% mortality) and low–resistance (lr, > 80% mortality) families were screened for their mhc class iib genotypes using the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) technique. the exon 2 sequences, encoding the major part of the peptide–binding region, were established for each dgge fragment. one allele, e, containing a missense single base substitution was significantly more prevalent in hr families than in lr families. an odds–ratio test showed that broods carrying this allele had a 12–fold higher chance of being hr than broods without the e allele. a second allele, i, showed significantly higher frequencies in uninfected and surviving individuals than in infected dead individuals. a third allele, j, tended to be more prevalent both in lr families and in individuals that had died of the infection. there was no correlation between mhc heterozygosity and resistance to a. salmonicida. our results support the hypothesis that mhc polymorphism is maintained through pathogen–driven selection acting by means of frequency–dependent selection rather than heterozygous advantage.
action analysis in image and video has been attracting more and more attention in computer vision. recognizing specific actions in video clips has been the main focus. we move in a new, more general direction in this paper and ask the critical fundamental question: what is action, how is action different from motion, and in a given image or video where is the action? we study the philosophical and visual characteristics of action, which lead us to define actionness: intentional bodily movement of biological agents (people, animals). to solve the general problem, we propose the lattice conditional ordinal random field model that incorporates local evidence as well as neighboring order agreement. we implement the new model in the continuous domain and apply it to scoring actionness in both image and video datasets. our experiments demonstrate not only that our new model can outperform the popular ranking svm but also that indeed action is distinct from motion.  detecting humans in films and videos is a challenging problem owing to the motion of the subjects, the camera and the background and to variations in pose, appearance, clothing, illumination and background clutter. we develop a detector for standing and moving people in videos with possibly moving cameras and backgrounds, testing several different motion coding schemes and showing empirically that orientated histograms of differential optical flow give the best overall performance. these motion-based descriptors are combined with our histogram of oriented gradient appearance descriptors. the resulting detector is tested on several databases including a challenging test set taken from feature films and containing wide ranges of pose, motion and background variations, including moving cameras and backgrounds. we validate our results on two challenging test sets containing more than 4400 human examples. the combined detector reduces the false alarm rate by a factor of 10 relative to the best appearance-based detector, for example giving false alarm rates of 1 per 20,000 windows tested at 8% miss rate on our test set 1.
backgroundoxygen sensing is a near universal signaling modality that, in eukaryotes ranging from protists such as dictyostelium and toxoplasma to humans, involves a cytoplasmic prolyl 4-hydroxylase that utilizes oxygen and α-ketoglutarate as potentially rate-limiting substrates. a divergence between the animal and protist mechanisms is the enzymatic target: the animal transcriptional factor subunit hypoxia inducible factor-α whose hydroxylation results in its poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and the protist e3scfubiquitin ligase subunit skp1 whose hydroxylation might control the stability of other proteins. in dictyostelium, genetic studies show that hydroxylation of skp1 by phya, and subsequent glycosylation of the hydroxyproline, is required for normal oxygen sensing during multicellular development at an air/water interface. because it has been difficult to detect an effect of hypoxia on skp1 hydroxylation itself, the role of skp1 modification was investigated in a submerged model of dictyostelium development dependent on atmospheric hyperoxia.resultsin static isotropic conditions beneath 70-100% atmospheric oxygen, amoebae formed radially symmetrical cyst-like aggregates consisting of a core of spores and undifferentiated cells surrounded by a cortex of stalk cells. analysis of mutants showed that cyst formation was inhibited by high skp1 levels via a hydroxylation-dependent mechanism, and spore differentiation required core glycosylation of skp1 by a mechanism that could be bypassed by excess skp1. failure of spores to differentiate at lower oxygen correlated qualitatively with reduced skp1 hydroxylation.conclusionwe propose that, in the physiological range, oxygen or downstream metabolic effectors control the timing of developmental progression via activation of newly synthesized skp1.  o(2) regulates multicellular development of the social amoeba dictyostelium, suggesting it may serve as an important cue in its native soil environment. dictyostelium expresses an hifα-type prolyl 4-hydroxylase (p4h1) whose levels affect the o(2)-threshold for culmination implicating it as a direct o(2)-sensor, as in animals. but dictyostelium lacks hifα, a mediator of animal prolyl 4-hydroxylase signaling, and p4h1 can hydroxylate pro143 of skp1, a subunit of e3(scf)ubiquitin-ligases. skp1 hydroxyproline then becomes the target of five sequential glycosyltransferase reactions that modulate the o(2)-signal. here we show that genetically induced changes in skp1 levels also affect the o(2)-threshold, in opposite direction to that of the modification enzymes suggesting that the latter reduce skp1 activity. consistent with this, overexpressed skp1 is poorly hydroxylated and skp1 is the only p4h1 substrate detectable in extracts. effects of pro143 mutations, and of combinations of skp1 and enzyme level perturbations, are consistent with pathway modulation of skp1 activity. however, some effects were not mirrored by changes in modification of the bulk skp1 pool, implicating a skp1 subpopulation and possibly additional unknown factors. altered skp1 levels also affected other developmental transitions in a modification-dependent fashion. whereas hydroxylation of animal hifα results in its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, dictyostelium skp1 levels were little affected by its modification status. these data indicate that skp1 and possibly e3(scf)ubiquitin-ligase activity modulate o(2)-dependent culmination and other developmental processes, and at least partially mediate the action of the hydroxylation/glycosylation pathway in o(2)-sensing.
transcriptional gene silencing (tgs) of the endogenous gbssi promoter in potato was induced by inverted repeat constructs containing different regions of the gbssi promoter. clear differences in silencing efficiency were observed. the 35sgbp-ir construct, containing sequences from −766 to −168 bp relative to the transcription initiation site (tis), induced weak silencing effects in 57–60% of the transformants. weak silencing effects were also induced by the asp-ir construct harbouring allele-specific sequences covering the region from −531 to −330 bp relative to the tis, but only in a low percentage (4–5.5%) of the transformants. these percentages are too low to distinguish effects between the two potato cultivars. therefore, this approach cannot be used to induce allele-specific tgs. strong silencing effects were obtained in 49% of the transformants harbouring the full promoter inverted repeat construct. this construct contained sequences from −766 to +194 bp relative to the tis. in the strongly silenced transformants no gbssi mrna could be detected by northern blot analysis. this was accompanied by the accumulation of gbssi promoter-specific small interfering rnas. methylation studies revealed that, in the weakly silenced 35sgbp-ir transformants, the hpaii site at −213 bp relative to the tis was methylated. apparently, methylation of this sequence does not result in strong silencing effects. in the full promoter transformants, both cg methylation and cnn methylation were detected. we show that, to obtain strong tgs, it is important to include sequences in the vicinity of the tis.  two distinct gene-silencing phenomena are observed in plants: transcriptional gene silencing (tgs), which involves decreased rna synthesis because of promoter methylation, and posttranscriptional gene silencing (ptgs), which involves sequence-specific rna degradation. ptgs is induced by deliberate [1-4] or fortuitous production (r.v.b., unpublished data) of double-stranded rna (dsrna). tgs could be the result of dna pairing [5], but could also be the result of dsrna, as was shown by the dsrna-induced inactivation of a transgenic promoter [6]. here, we show that when targeting flower pigmentation genes in petunia, transgenes expressing dsrna can induce ptgs when coding sequences are used and tgs when promoter sequences are taken. for both types of silencing, small rna species are found, which are thought to be dsrna decay products [7] and determine the sequence specificity of the silencing process [8, 9]. furthermore, silencing is accompanied by the methylation of dna sequences that are homologous to dsrna. dna methylation is assumed to be essential for regulating tgs and important for reinforcing ptgs [10]. therefore, we conclude that tgs and ptgs are mechanistically related. in addition, we show that dsrna-induced tgs provides an efficient tool to generate gene knockouts, because not only does the tgs of a ptgs-inducing transgene fully revert the ptgs phenotype, but also an endogenous gene can be transcriptionally silenced by dsrna corresponding to its promoter.
the management of the palatal cleft, dental arch, and subsequent maxillary form is a challenge for the craniomaxillofacial surgeon. the purpose of this paper is to present the experience of a senior surgeon (kes) who has treated over 2000 patients with cleft lip and palate. this paper focuses on the experience of a recent series of 103 consecutive orthognathic cases treated by one surgeon with a surgical-orthodontic, speech-oriented approach. it will concentrate on not only correcting the occlusion, as others have described, but also on how a surgeon who was trying to achieve optimal aesthetic balance, harmony, and beauty, approached this problem.  craniofacial osteotomies have by convention been bilamellar translocations of the entire substance of the dysmorphic bone. this approach limits the surgeon by reducing the stable bone mass available for fixation, creating dependence on concave surfaces. most important, it changes the bony topography that determines the preoperative plan. this paper presents a new craniofacial concept and technique used in 26 patients with various dysmorphic syndromes who were reconstructed by performing a lamellar split osteotomy. this technique maintains the internal lamella in its native position, thereby allowing it to act as a reference for the bony topography and providing a stable facial framework for rigid fixation. this interlamellar osteotomy has led to improved aesthetic results in the orthomorphic reconstructions of congenital and other deformities. it can be used in any aesthetic patient in whom contour changes or augmentation of form is desired. it is recommended as a preferred method for achieving quantitative contour improvement in patients over 3 years of age.
in 2009, a novel lyssavirus (subsequently named ikoma lyssavirus, ikov) was detected in the brain of an african civet (civettictis civetta) with clinical rabies in the serengeti national park of tanzania. the degree of nucleotide divergence between the genome of ikov and those of other lyssaviruses predicted antigenic distinction from, and lack of protection provided by, available rabies vaccines. in addition, the index case was considered likely to be an incidental spillover event, and therefore the true reservoir of ikov remained to be identified. the advent of sensitive molecular techniques has led to a rapid increase in the discovery of novel viruses. detecting viral sequence alone, however, only allows for prediction of phenotypic characteristics and not their measurement. in the present study we describe the in vitro and in vivo characterization of ikov, demonstrating that it is (1) pathogenic by peripheral inoculation in an animal model, (2) antigenically distinct from current rabies vaccine strains and (3) poorly neutralized by sera from humans and animals immunized against rabies. in a laboratory mouse model, no protection was elicited by a licensed rabies vaccine. we also investigated the role of bats as reservoirs of ikov. we found no evidence for infection among 483 individuals of at least 13 bat species sampled across sites in the serengeti and southern kenya.  abstract all lyssaviruses cause fatal encephalitis in mammals. there is sufficient antigenic variation within the genus to cause variable vaccine efficacy, but this variation is difficult to characterize quantitatively: sequence analysis cannot yet provide detailed antigenic information, and antigenic neutralization data have been refractory to high-resolution robust interpretation. here, we address these issues by using state-of-the-art antigenic analyses to generate a high-resolution antigenic map of a global panel of 25 lyssaviruses. we compared the calculated antigenic distances with viral glycoprotein ectodomain sequence data. although 67% of antigenic variation was predictable from the glycoprotein amino acid sequence, there are in some cases substantial differences between genetic and antigenic distances, thus highlighting the risk of inferring antigenic relationships solely from sequence data at this time. these differences included epidemiologically important antigenic differences between vaccine strains and wild-type rabies viruses. further, we quantitatively assessed the antigenic relationships measured by using rabbit, mouse, and human sera, validating the use of nonhuman experimental animals as a model for determining antigenic variation in humans. the use of passive immune globulin is a crucial component of rabies postexposure prophylaxis, and here we also show that it is possible to predict the reactivity of immune globulin against divergent lyssaviruses.
purposetraditionally, valgus knee deformity is predominately corrected by stabilisation with a plate inserted via the medial approach to the supracondylar region of the femur. however, this technique is unfavourable from both a biomechanical and a biological point of view. a revised retrograde dynamic locked nailing was developed to improve correction of this defect.methodforty-one knees with valgus deformity (average tibiofemoral angle, 22°; range, 16–29°) in 25 adult patients were treated by oblique femoral supracondylar varus osteotomy and stabilised with retrograde dynamic locked nails. postoperatively, early ambulation with protected weight bearing and range of motion knee exercises were encouraged.resultthirty-five knees of 21 patients were followed-up for an average of 2.6 years (range, 1.1–4.5 years). all osteotomy sites healed with an average union period of 3.4 months (range, 2.5–5.0 months). there were no significant complications. at the latest follow-up, the average tibiofemoral angle was 7.1° valgus (range, 4–10° valgus). for all of the knees, the outcomes were satisfactory (p < 0.001).conclusionthe technique described here may be a feasible alternative for correction of valgus knee deformity. the advantages of this technique include the use of a biomechanically more appropriate method, a minimal complication rate and a high rate of satisfactory outcomes.  twenty-one patients with lateral compartment osteoarthritis and valgus deformity of the knee underwent distal femoral supracondylar osteotomy (medial closing wedge) between 1983 and 1993 with follow-up ranging from 1 to 8 years. ten knees had plaster cast immobilization, 5 had fixation with 2 staples supplemented with a plaster cast, and 6 knees had rigid internal fixation with an ao blade plate. thirty-three percent of patients had a satisfactory result using the hss score, and 57% had a satisfactory result using the knee society clinical rating. fifty-seven percent had a significant complication, including severe knee stiffness requiring manipulation under anesthesia (48%), nonunion/delayed union (19%), infection (10%), and fixation failure (5%). five (19%) knees required total knee replacement within 5 years of surgery. satisfactory results were obtained only in those patients who had less severe degrees of osteoarthritis confined to the lateral compartment (grades i to iii), adequate correction of valgus deformity (the anatomical axis within 2 degrees from zero), and rigid internal fixation to permit postoperative early mobilization. these results indicate that distal femoral osteotomy is a satisfactory procedure in the young, active patient with osteoarthritis of the lateral compartment of the knee, but requires precise surgical technique and rigid internal fixation.
background seasonal affective disorder (sad) is a subtype of recurrent depressive or bipolar disorder that is characterized by regular onset and remission of affective episodes at the same time of the year. the aim of the present study was to provide epidemiological data and data on the socioeconomic impact of sad in the general population of austria.   methods we conducted a computer-assisted telephone interview in 910 randomly selected subjects (577 females and 333 males) using the seasonal health questionnaire (shq), the seasonal pattern assessment questionnaire (spaq), and the sheehan disability scale (sds). telephone numbers were randomly drawn from all austrian telephone books and transformed using the random last digits method. the last birthday method was employed to choose the target person for the interviews.   results out of our subjects, 2.5% fulfilled criteria for the seasonal pattern specifier according to dsm-5 and 2.4% (95% ci=1.4-3.5%) were diagnosed with sad. when applying the icd-10 criteria 1.9% (95% ci=0.9-2.8%) fulfilled sad diagnostic criteria. the prevalence of fall-winter depression according to the kasper-rosenthal criteria was determined to be 3.5%. the criteria was fulfilled by 15.1% for subsyndromal sad (s-sad). we did not find any statistically significant gender differences in prevalence rates. when using the dsm-5 as a gold standard for the diagnosis of sad, diagnosis derived from the spaq yielded a sensitivity of 31.8% and a specificity of 97.2%. subjects with sad had significantly higher scores on the sds and higher rates of sick leave and days with reduced productivity than healthy subjects.   conclusions prevalence estimates for sad with the shq are lower than with the spaq. our data are indicative of the substantial burden of disease and the socioeconomic impact of sad. this epidemiological data shows a lack of gender differences in sad prevalence. the higher rates of females in clinical sad samples might, at least in part, be explained by lower help seeking behaviour in males.  backgroundan interview format version of the sheehan disability scale (sds) modified to assess gambling treatment outcomes was assessed for reliability and validity. the sds assesses impairment in work, family and social functioning related to mental disorders.methodsa pilot study (n = 21) determined the preferred wording for oral administration. participants with pathological gambling in a relapse prevention clinical trial completed the scale and other validation measures at baseline, six and twelve month follow-ups (n = 169).resultsconfirmatory factor analysis supported a one factor solution and the scale had good internal reliability for a three item scale. the sds was sensitive to change and correlations with recent gambling behaviour and severity were moderate as expected. similarly, correlations with self-efficacy, perceived control over gambling, and craving were moderate, but they were lower for less directly related constructs such as depression and perceived family and friend support.conclusionsthe sds is a brief, psychometrically sound, outcome measure of impairment associated with gambling disorders that can be administered by telephone.
toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) is known to mediate monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, however, its role on the expression of monocyte adhesion molecules is unclear. in the present study, we investigated the role of tlr4 on the expression of monocyte adhesion molecules, and determined the functional role of tlr4-induced adhesion molecules on monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. when thp-1 monocytes were stimulated with kdo2-lipid a (kla), a specific tlr4 agonist, mac-1 expression was markedly increased in association with an increased adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. these were attenuated by anti-mac-1 antibody, suggesting a functional role of tlr4-induced mac-1 on monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. in monocytes treated with mk886, a 5-lipoxygenase (lo) inhibitor, both mac-1 expression and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells induced by kla were markedly attenuated. moreover, kla increased the expression of mrna and protein of 5-lo, suggesting a pivotal role of 5-lo on these processes. in in vivo studies, kla increased monocyte adhesion to aortic endothelium of wild-type (wt) mice, which was attenuated in wt mice treated with anti-mac-1 antibody as well as in tlr4-deficient mice. taken together, tlr4-mediated expression of mac-1 in monocytes plays a pivotal role on monocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium, leading to increased foam cell formation in the development of atherosclerosis.  platelets are essential for primary hemostasis, but they also play an important pro-inflammatory role. platelets normally circulate in a quiescent state. upon activation, platelets can secrete and present various molecules, change their shape as well as the expression pattern of adhesion molecules. these changes are associated with the adhesion of platelets to leukocytes and the vessel wall. the interaction of platelets with neutrophils promotes the recruitment of neutrophils into inflammatory tissue and thus participates in host defense. this interaction of neutrophils with platelets is mainly mediated through p-selectin and beta(2) and beta(3) integrins (cd11b/cd18, cd41/cd61). platelets can also interact with endothelial cells and monocytes. adherent platelets promote the 'secondary capture' of neutrophils and other leukocytes. in addition, platelets secrete neutrophil and endothelial activators inducing production of inflammatory cytokines. thus, platelets are important amplifiers of acute inflammation.
ubiquitin‐mediated proteolysis triggered by the anaphase‐promoting complex/cyclosome (apc/c) is essential for sister chromatid separation and the mitotic exit. like ubiquitylation, protein modification with the small ubiquitin‐related modifier sumo appears to be important during mitosis, because yeast cells impaired in the sumo‐conjugating enzyme ubc9 were found to be blocked in mitosis and defective in cyclin degradation. here, we analysed the role of sumoylation in the metaphase/anaphase transition and in apc/c‐mediated proteolysis in saccharomyces cerevisiae. we show that cells depleted of ubc9 or smt3, the yeast sumo protein, mostly arrested with undivided nuclei and with high levels of securin pds1. this metaphase block was partially relieved by a deletion of pds1. the absence of ubc9 or smt3 also resulted in defects in chromosome segregation. temperature‐sensitive ubc9‐2 mutants were delayed in proteolysis of pds1 and of cyclin clb2 during mitosis. the requirement of sumoylation for apc/c‐mediated degradation was tested more directly in g1‐arrested cells. both ubc9‐2 and smt3‐331 mutants were defective in efficient degradation of pds1 and mitotic cyclins, whereas proteolysis of unstable proteins that are not apc/c substrates was unaffected. we conclude that sumoylation is needed for efficient proteolysis mediated by apc/c in budding yeast.  cell cycle progression in eukaryotes is controlled by the p34cdc21cdc28 protein kinase and its short-lived, phase-specific regulatory subunits called cyclins1,2. in xenopus oocytes, degradation of m-phase (b-type) cyclins is required for exit from mitosis and is mediated by the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system3. here we show that b-type-cyclin degradation in yeast involves an essential nuclear ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, ubc9. repression of ubc9 synthesis prevents cell cycle progression at the g2 or early m phase, causing the accumulation of large budded cells with a single nucleus, a short spindle and replicated dna. in ubc9 mutants both clb5, an s-phase cyclin4,5, and clb2, an m-phase cyclin6,7, are stabilized. in wild-type cells the clb5 protein is unstable throughout the cell cycle, whereas clb2 turnover occurs only at a specific cell-cycle stage8. thus distinct degradation signals or regulated interaction with the ubiquitin-protein ligase system may determine the cell-cycle specificity of cyclin proteolysi
intracellular k+ plays an important role in controlling the cytoplasmic ion homeostasis for maintaining cell volume and inhibiting apoptotic enzymes in the cytosol and nucleus. cytoplasmic k+ concentration is mainly regulated by k+ uptake via na+-k+-atpase and k+ efflux through k+ channels in the plasma membrane. carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (fccp), a protonophore that dissipates the h+ gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria, induces apoptosis in many cell types. in rat and human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (pasmc), fccp opened the large-conductance, voltage- and ca2+-sensitive kk+ (maxi-k) channels, increased k+ currents through maxi-k channels [i(k(ca))], and induced apoptosis. tetraethylammonia (1 mm) and iberiotoxin (100 nm) decreased i(k(ca)) by blocking the sarcolemmal maxi-k channels and inhibited the fccp-induced apoptosis in pasmc cultured in media containing serum and growth factors. furthermore, inhibition of k+ efflux by raising extracellular k+ concentration from 5 to 40 mm also attenuated pasmc apoptosis induced by fccp and the k+ ionophore valinomycin. these results suggest that fccp-mediated apoptosis in pasmc is partially due to an increase of maxi-k channel activity. the resultant k+ loss through opened maxi-k channels may serve as a trigger for cell shrinkage and caspase activation, which are major characteristics of apoptosis in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells.  over recent years, it has become clear that mitochondria play a central role in many key aspects of animal physiology and pathophysiology. their central and ubiquitous task is clearly the production of atp. nevertheless, they also play subtle roles in glucose homeostasis, acting as the sensor for substrate supply in the transduction pathway that promotes insulin secretion by the pancreatic β‐cell and that modulates the excitability of the hypothalamic glucose‐sensitive neurons involved in appetite control. mitochondria may also act as sensors of availability of oxygen, the other major mitochondrial substrate, in the regulation of respiration. mitochondria take up calcium, and the high capacity mitochondrial calcium uptake pathway provides a mechanism that couples energy demand to increased atp production through the calcium‐dependent upregulation of mitochondrial enzyme activity. mitochondrial calcium accumulation may also have a substantial impact on the spatiotemporal dynamics of cellular calcium signals, with subtle differences of detail in different cell types. recent work has also revealed the centrality of mitochondrial dysfunction as an irreversible step in the pathway to both necrotic and apoptotic cell death. this review looks at recent developments in these rapidly evolving areas of cell physiology in an attempt to draw together disparate areas of research into a common theme.
objectiveacute kidney injury (aki) after cardiac surgery procedures is associated with poor patient outcomes. cystatin c as a marker for renal failure has been shown to be of prognostic value; however, a wide range of its predictive accuracy has been reported. the aim of the study was to evaluate whether the measurement of pre- and postoperative serum cystatin c improves the prediction of aki.methodsin a single-centre, prospective study of 70 patients (74 ± 9ys; range 47-85ys; 77% male), cystatin c was measured six times: (t1 = preoperative, t2 = start cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb), t3 = 20 min after cpb, t4 = end of operation; t5 = 24 h postoperatively; t6 = 7d postoperatively). predictive property, in terms of the need for renal replacement therapy (rrt), was analysed by receiver operating characteristics (roc) statistics and described by the area under the curve (auc).resultswith respect to rrt (n = 8), serum cystatin c was significantly higher at the end of the operation (t4), 24 h postoperatively at t5 and at t6. the aucs for preoperative t1 and intraoperative t2/3 cystatin c were <0.7 (95% ci, 0.47-0.85). the earliest significant predictive aucs were found at the end of the operation (t4: p = 0.03 95% ci 0.58-0.88 auc 0.73) and 24 h postoperatively (t5: p = 0.003 95% ci 0.74-0.96 auc 0.85).conclusionsearly postoperative serum cystatin c increase appears to be a moderate biomarker in the prediction of aki, whereas a preoperative and intraoperative cystatin c increase has only a limited diagnostic and predictive value.  introductionin critically ill patients sudden changes in glomerular filtration rate (gfr) are not instantly followed by parallel changes in serum creatinine. the aim of the present study was to analyze the utility of serum cystatin c as a marker of renal function in these patients.methodsserum creatinine, serum cystatin c and 24-hour creatinine clearance (ccr) were determined in 50 critically ill patients (age 21–86 years; mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score 20 ± 9). they did not have chronic renal failure but were at risk for developing renal dysfunction. serum cystatin c was measured using particle enhanced immunonephelometry. twenty-four-hour body surface adjusted ccr was used as a control because it is the 'gold standard' for determining gfr.resultsserum creatinine, serum cystatin c and ccr (mean ± standard deviation [range]) were 1.00 ± 0.85 mg/dl (0.40–5.61 mg/dl), 1.19 ± 0.79 mg/l (0.49–4.70 mg/l), and 92.74 ± 52.74 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (8.17–233.21 ml/min per 1.73 m2), respectively. our data showed that serum cystatin c correlated better with gfr than did creatinine (1/cystatin c versus ccr: r = 0.832, p < 0.001; 1/creatinine versus ccr: r = 0.426, p = 0.002). cystatin c was diagnostically superior to creatinine (area under the curve [auc] for cystatin c 0.927, 95% confidence interval 86.1–99.4; auc for creatinine 0.694, 95% confidence interval 54.1–84.6). half of the patients had acute renal dysfunction. only five (20%) of these 25 patients had elevated serum creatinine, whereas 76% had elevated serum cystatin c levels (p = 0.032).conclusioncystatin c is an accurate marker of subtle changes in gfr, and it may be superior to creatinine when assessing this parameter in clinical practice in critically ill patients.
obesity is associated with an increased frequency, morbidity, and mortality of several types of neoplastic diseases, including postmenopausal breast cancer. we found that human adipose tissue contains two populations of progenitors with cooperative roles in breast cancer. cd45(-)cd34(+)cd31(+)cd13(-)ccrl2(+) endothelial cells can generate mature endothelial cells and capillaries. their cancer-promoting effect in the breast was limited in the absence of cd45(-)cd34(+)cd31(-)cd13(+)cd140b(+) mesenchymal progenitors/adipose stromal cells (asc), which generated pericytes and were more efficient than endothelial cells in promoting local tumor growth. both endothelial cells and ascs induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (emt) gene expression in luminal breast cancer cells. endothelial cells (but not ascs) migrated to lymph nodes and to contralateral nascent breast cancer lesions where they generated new vessels. in vitro and in vivo, endothelial cells were more efficient than ascs in promoting tumor migration and in inducing metastases. granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) effectively mobilized endothelial cells (but not ascs), and the addition of chemotherapy and/or of cxcr4 inhibitors did not increase endothelial cell or asc blood mobilization. our findings suggest that adipose tissue progenitor cells cooperate in driving progression and metastatic spread of breast cancer.  previous studies have suggested a "catalytic role" in neoplastic angiogenesis and cancer progression for bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (epc). however, preclinical and clinical studies have shown that the quantitative role of marrow-derived epcs in cancer vascularization is extremely variable. we have found that human and murine white adipose tissue (wat) is a very rich reservoir of cd45-cd34(+) epcs with endothelial differentiation potential, containing a mean of 263 times more cd45-cd34(+) cells/ml than bone marrow. compared with marrow-derived cd34(+) cells mobilized in blood by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, purified wat-cd34(+) cells expressed similar levels of stemness-related genes, significantly increased levels of angiogenesis-related genes, and increased levels of fap-α, a crucial suppressor of antitumor immunity. in vitro, wat-cd34(+) cells generated mature endothelial cells and capillary tubes as efficiently as mature mesenchymal cells. the coinjection of human wat-cd34(+) cells from lipotransfer procedures contributed to tumor vascularization and significantly increased tumor growth and metastases in several orthotopic models of human breast cancer in immunodeficient mice. endothelial cells derived from human wat-cd34(+) cells lined the lumen of cancer vessels. these data indicate that cd34(+) wat cells can promote cancer progression and metastases. our results highlight the importance of gaining a better understanding of the role of different wat-derived cells used in lipotransfer for breast reconstruction in patients with breast cancer.
although much evidence indicates that rt increases as a function of computational load in many cognitive tasks, quantification of changes in neural activity related to increasing demand of cognitive control has rarely been attempted. in this fmri study, we used a majority function task to quantify the effect of computational load on brain activation, reflecting the mental processes instantiated by cognitive control under conditions of uncertainty. we found that the activation of the frontoparieto-cingulate system as well as the deactivation of the anticorrelated default mode network varied parametrically as a function of information uncertainty, estimated as entropy with an information theoretic model. the current findings suggest that activity changes in the dynamic networks of the brain (especially the frontoparieto-cingulate system) track with information uncertainty, rather than only conflict or other commonly proposed targets of cognitive control.  tasks involving conflict between stimulus dimensions have been shown to activate dorsal anterior cingulate and prefrontal areas. it has been proposed that the dorsal anterior cingulate is involved a domain general process of monitoring conflict, while prefrontal areas are involved in resolving conflict. we examine three tasks that all require people to respond based on one stimulus dimension while ignoring another conflicting dimension, but which vary in the source of conflict. one of the tasks uses language stimuli (stroop effect) and two use nonlanguage spatial conflicts appropriate for children and nonhuman animals. in experiment 1, 12 participants were studied with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) while performing each of the three tasks. reaction times for each of the three tasks were significantly longer in the incongruent condition compared with the congruent condition, demonstrating that each task elicits a conflict. by studying the same people in the same session, we test the hypothesis that conflict activates a similar brain network in the three tasks. significant activations were found in the anterior cingulate and left prefrontal cortex for all three conflict tasks. within these regions, the conflict component demonstrated evidence for significant common activation across the three tasks, although the peak activation point and spatial extent were not identical. other areas demonstrated activation unique to each task. experiments 2-4 provide behavioral evidence indicating considerable independence between conflict operations involved in the tasks. the behavioral and fmri results taken together seem to argue against a single unified network for processing conflict, but instead support either distinct networks for each conflict task or a single network that monitors conflict with different sites used to resolve the conflict.
we obtain relations among boundary states in bosonic minimal open string theory using the boundary ground ring. we also obtain a difference equation that boundary correlators must satisfy.  the correspondence claimed by douglas between the multicritical regimes of the two-matrix model and 2d gravity coupled with (p,q) rational matter field, is worked out explicity. we found the minimal (p,q) multicritical potentials u(x) and v(y), which are polynomials of degree p and q, correspondingly. the loop averages w(x) and w(y) are shown to satisfy the heisenberg relations {w, x} = 1 and {w, y} = 1 essentially coincide with the canonical momenta p and q. the operators x and y create the two kinds of boundaries in the (p,q) model related by the duality (p,q) ↔ (q,p). finally, we present a closed expression for the two two-loop correlators, and interpret its scaling limit.
the current microelectromechanical systems (mems) technology enables the deployment of relatively low-cost wireless sensor networks composed of mems microphone arrays for accurate sound source localization. however, the evaluation and the selection of the most accurate and power-efficient network’s topology are not trivial when considering dynamic mems microphone arrays. although software simulators are usually considered, they consist of high-computational intensive tasks, which require hours to days to be completed. in this paper, we present an fpga-based platform to emulate a network of microphone arrays. our platform provides a controlled simulated acoustic environment, able to evaluate the impact of different network configurations such as the number of microphones per array, the network’s topology, or the used detection method. data fusion techniques, combining the data collected by each node, are used in this platform. the platform is designed to exploit the fpga’s partial reconfiguration feature to increase the flexibility of the network emulator as well as to increase performance thanks to the use of the pci-express high-bandwidth interface. on the one hand, the network emulator presents a higher flexibility by partially reconfiguring the nodes’ architecture in runtime. on the other hand, a set of strategies and heuristics to properly use partial reconfiguration allows the acceleration of the emulation by exploiting the execution parallelism. several experiments are presented to demonstrate some of the capabilities of our platform and the benefits of using partial reconfiguration.  the use of microphone arrays for sound-source localization is a well-researched topic. the response of such sensor arrays is dependent on the quantity of microphones operating on the array. a higher number of microphones, however, increase the computational demand, making real-time response challenging. in this paper, we present a filter-and-sum based architecture and several acceleration techniques to provide accurate sound-source localization in real-time. experiments demonstrate how an accurate sound-source localization is obtained in a couple of milliseconds, independently of the number of microphones. finally, we also propose different strategies to further accelerate the sound-source localization while offering increased angular resolution.
opals offer a practical way to realize 3d bandgap functional materials. we have fabricated and optically characterized opals incorporating optical fibre tapers. opals assembled from silver-coated microspheres exhibit enhanced the refractive index contrast and bandgap effects.  a capillary deposition method for the preparation of opal and inverse opal films has been developed. by this method, one can control the film thickness and the crack arrangement in opal as well as inverse opal structures. this method combines tube capillarity with cell capillarity or with gravity depending on the stability of the suspensions. the combination of tube capillarity with cell capillarity is used to prepare opal films from stable suspensions. the tube capillary transports the suspension, while the cell capillary helps to assemble the spheres. the setup defines the drying fronts, thickness, and crack arrangements of the opal films. the combination of capillarity with gravity is useful for making opal films from unstable suspensions. opal films of spheres with size up to 1 mum can be easily prepared from this combination. here, the gravity influences the arrangement of the spheres. the two-capillary setup has also been used to infiltrate the opal films with a titania precursor. after calcination, inverse titania opal films with skeleton structure have been obtained.
as the number of cores increases in a single chip processor, several challenges arise: wire delays, contention for out-of-chip accesses, and core heterogeneity. in order to address these issues and the applications demands, future large-scale many-core processors are expected to be organized as a collection of numa clusters of heterogeneous cores. in this work we propose a scheduler that takes into account the non-uniform memory latency, the heterogeneity of the cores, and the contention to the memory controller to find the best matching core for the application's memory and compute requirements. scheduler decisions are based on an on-line classification process that determines applications requirements either as memory- or compute-bound. we evaluate our proposed scheduler on the 48-core intel scc using applications from spec cpu2006 benchmark suite. our results show that even when all cores are busy, migrating processes to cores that match better the requirements of applications results in overall performance improvement. in particular we observed a reduction of the execution time from 15% to 36% compared to a random static scheduling policy.  on august 24, 2006, the standard performance evaluation corporation (spec) announced cpu2006 [2], which replaces cpu2000. the spec cpu benchmarks are widely used in both industry and academia [3].
transcellular placental maternofetal flux of calcium and magnesium is reduced in diabetic pregnancy in the rat which might be due to changes in placental cellularity. in order to investigate this wet and dry weight, dna and protein content were measured in placentas from untreated diabetic (d(o)), insulin-treated diabetic (d(i)) and control rats (c) on day 21 of gestation (term=23 days). wet and dry weights (mg; mean+/-s.e.m.) were 418+/-13, 474+/-19, 416+/-14 and 66+/-3, 75+/-3, 67+/-3 in c, d(o) and d(i) groups, respectively. total dna and protein content (mg) was 1.8+/-0.2, 1.7+/-0.1, 1.5+/-0.1 and 50.4+/-2.4, 54.9+/-2.6, 51.9+/-3.3 in c, d(o) and d(i) groups, respectively. the data suggest that placental cellularity is unaffected by maternal diabetes mellitus in the rat and is unlikely to directly affect maternofetal flux of calcium and magnesium.  we describe a modified procedure of the diphenylamine-colorimetric method for assay of dna that is shorter than the procedure described by burton. this improvement is achieved by raising the sample incubation temperature to 50 degrees c. the higher temperature hastens and stabilizes the diphenylamine reaction with dna so that absorbances of samples can be measured as early as 3 h after the reaction is started. this shortened assay is able to detect as little as 3 micrograms of calf thymus dna. this method is suitable for measuring dna content of epidermal tissue.
objectivesto evaluate the measurement properties of the euroqol eq-5d and two condition-specific patient-reported outcome measures—the symptom severity index (ssi) and the urinary incontinence-specific quality of life instrument (i-qol)—in women with urinary incontinence.methodsa questionnaire comprising all instruments was completed by women taking part in a clinical trial of physiotherapy for urinary incontinence. follow-up questionnaires were at 6 weeks and 5 months. data quality, internal consistency reliability, validity and responsiveness were assessed.resultsone hundred and seventy-four patients taking part in the clinical trial completed the questionnaire. instruments had low levels of missing data. the eq-5d had a large ceiling effect and poor responsiveness. the ssi had poor validity and responsiveness. the i-qol had levels of reliability that supported application in group assessment, and in some cases, individual assessment, and good evidence of validity. the i-qol was the most responsive instrument at both 6 weeks and 5 months.conclusionthe i-qol was the best performing instrument and is recommended as a continence-specific measure of quality of life in a clinical trial setting. the ssi and eq-5d are not recommended. alternative generic instruments, which support economic evaluation, require further evaluation in trials of female urinary incontinence.  objectives to report on the further development of the incontinence quality of life instrument (i-qol), a self-report quality of life measure specific to urinary incontinence (ui), including its measurement model, responsiveness, and effect size.   methods incontinent female patients (141 with stress, 147 with mixed ui) completed the i-qol and comparative measures at screening, pretreatment, and four subsequent follow-up visits during participation in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial assessing the efficacy of duloxetine. psychometric testing followed standardized procedures.   results factor analysis confirmed an overall score and three subscale scores (avoidance and limiting behaviors, psychosocial impacts, and social embarrassment). all scores were internally consistent (alpha = 0.87 to 0.93) and reproducible (icc = 0.87 to 0.91). the pattern of previously reported correlations with the short-form 36-item health survey and psychological well-being schedule were confirmed. responsiveness statistics using changes in the independent measures of stress test pad weight, number of incontinent episodes, and patient global impression of improvement ranged from 0.4 to 0.8. minimally important changes ranged from 2% to 5% in association with these measures and effect sizes.   conclusions in a clinical trial, the i-qol proved to be valid, reproducible, and responsive to treatment for ui in women.
backgroundmechanosensitive afferents innervating the bladder increase their firing rate as the bladder fills and pressure rises. however, the relationship between afferent firing rates and intravesical pressure is not a simple linear one. firing rate responses to pressure can differ depending on prior activity, demonstrating hysteresis in the system. though this hysteresis has been commented on in published literature, it has not been quantified.resultssixty-six bladder afferents recorded from sacral dorsal root ganglia in five alpha-chloralose anesthetized felines were identified based on their characteristic responses to pressure (correlation coefficient ≥ 0.2) during saline infusion (2 ml/min). for saline infusion trials, we calculated a maximum hysteresis ratio between the firing rate difference at each pressure and the overall firing rate range (or hmax) of 0.86 ± 0.09 (mean ± standard deviation) and mean hysteresis ratio (or hmean) of 0.52 ± 0.13 (n = 46 afferents). for isovolumetric trials in two experiments (n = 33 afferents) hmax was 0.72 ± 0.14 and hmean was 0.40 ± 0.14.conclusionsa comprehensive state model that integrates these hysteresis parameters to determine the bladder state may improve upon existing neuroprostheses for bladder control.  although sacral anterior root neuromodulation (sarn) has proven to be effective in patients with neurogenic bladder, it is not widely accepted due to the need to conduct a dorsal rhizotomy, and commercially available sarn devices are not usually equipped with a closed-loop controller for the automatic regulation of bladder functions. therefore, there is still a need for a more effective electrical neuromodulation scheme to restore bladder function. intravesical pressure (ivp) is the major biosignal that reflects the state of bladder conditions. the present study develops a closed-loop control strategy for improving bladder emptying and verifies its performance using animal experiments. two channel outputs of electrical currents triggered by ivp-feedback signals were set to automatically regulate a rat's pudendal nerve for selective nerve stimulation and blocking. under this experimental design, a series of in vivo animal experiments were conducted on anesthetized rats, including the computational characterization of biosignals, the development of an intermittent high-frequency blocking current waveform for blocking the nerve, and verification of the control strategy. results show that the ivp-feedback control strategy for dual-channel pudendal neuromodulation performed well in animal experiments and could be utilized to selectively stimulate and block the pudendal nerve to augment bladder contraction and restore external urethral sphincter bursting activity to improve bladder emptying. this study demonstrates the feasibility of the ivp-based feedback-control strategy with animal experiments. the results could provide a basis for developing a sophisticated neural prosthesis for restoring bladder function in clinical use or for neurophysiological study.
foraging honeybees are likely to learn visual and chemical cues associated with many different food sources. here, we explore how many such sources can be memorized and recalled. marked bees were trained to visit two (or three) sugar feeders, each placed at a different outdoor location and carrying a different scent. we then tested the ability of the bees to recall these locations and fly to them, when the training scents were blown into the hive, and the scents and food at the feeders were removed. when trained on two feeder locations, each associated with a different scent, the bees could correctly recall the location associated with each scent. however, this ability broke down when the number of scents and feeder locations was increased to three. performance was partially restored when each of the three training feeders was endowed with an additional cue, namely, a distinct colour. our results suggest that bees can recall a maximum of two locations when each is associated with a different scent. however, this number can be increased if the scent cues are augmented by visual cues. these findings have implications for the ways in which associations are established and laid down in honeybee memory.  poor fetal growth is linked with long-term detrimental effects on health in adulthood. here we investigate whether the lifespan of male mice is affected by their growth rate when they were suckling and find that limiting growth during that period not only increases longevity but also protects against the life-shortening effect of an obesity-inducing diet later on. by contrast, we find that lifespan is considerably shortened if the postnatal period of growth is accelerated to make up for reduced growth in utero, and that, in addition, these mice are susceptible to the adverse effects on longevity of an obesity-inducing diet after weaning.
abstract. inhalation toxicokinetics of p-dichlorobenzene (p-dcb) in humans was evaluated, and the amounts of daily absorption and internal accumulation were estimated in order to obtain fundamental data for the risk assessment of chronic low-level exposure in the general population. seven male subjects continuously inhaled about 2.5 ppm of p-dcb vapor for 1 h, and the concentration-time courses of p-dcb in their exhaled air and serum and of urinary 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-dcp), a major metabolite of p-dcb, were examined. the toxicokinetics of p-dcb was evaluated on the basis of the time courses using a linear two-compartment model. the amounts of p-dcb absorbed daily and the internal accumulation in chronic low-level exposure were extrapolated using the estimated toxicokinetic parameters. p-dcb was transferred from inhaled air to the body with a constant high absorption rate during exposure. the major route for elimination from the body was urinary excretion followed by metabolism, not exhalation. however, during 9–11 h after the start of exposure, the fraction of p-dcb excreted in urine was only 5–16% of the amount absorbed. furthermore, most of the absorbed p-dcb seemed to be distributed rapidly to the tissues, such as fat, according to toxicokinetic analysis. consequently, p-dcb seems to require a long time to be completely eliminated from the body. the amounts of daily absorption and internal accumulation were extrapolated to average 0.27 mg/day and 2.9 mg, respectively, in the subjects exposed chronically to 1 ppb of p-dcb. the amount absorbed daily agreed approximately with that extrapolated from rats which inhaled p-dcb in our previous study.  the biotransformation and kinetics of 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-dcb) were studied in male wistar rats at three oral dose levels (10, 50 and 250 mg/kg). the effect of induction of cyp2e1 by isoniazid on the kinetics and biotransformation was determined. excretion was predominantly via the urine (78-85%) and to a small extent via the faeces (2-5%). the relative contributions of these routes were not dose dependent. excretion via the bile ranged from less than 5% at the low dose level to 30% at the high dose level. the major biliary metabolite was the glucuronide of 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-dcp). the time point at which the plasma concentrations of the parent compound and the metabolites were maximal (tcmax) as well as the maximum concentrations (cmax) increased with higher dose level. induction by isoniazid resulted in a faster urinary elimination, whereas tcmax and cmax were lower for induced rats. in addition, the area under the blood curve (auc) was smaller and total clearance was higher for induced rats. 1,4-dcb was mainly metabolized to 2,5-dcp (ca. 90%), which was detected in the urine as its sulfate (50-60%), glucuronide (20-30%) and the free form (5-10%). minor metabolites were the n-acetyl-cysteine-s-dihydro-hydroxy-1,4-dichlorobenzene and the corresponding dehydrated n-acetyl-cysteine-s-1,4-dichlorobenzene, which comprised ca. 10% of total metabolites. no hydroquinones were observed for the male wistar rat, not even under conditions of induced oxidative metabolism.
serious losses have occurred at the u.s. fish and wildlife service, craig brook national fish hatchery, east orland, maine, among eggs that were taken from atlantic salmon salmo salar, which were held as captive broodfish during their returns to the penobscot river, naraguagus river, and machias river to spawn. bacterial isolations were attempted from external surfaces and the internal contents of individual eggs. externally and in all cases, pseudomonas fluorescens was the predominant bacterium associated with the surface of all eggs. these bacteria were resistant to a surface treatment of 1,667 ppm formalin for 15 min and, therefore, the monoclonal nature of p. fluorescens on egg surfaces was considered to result from its ability to resist the germicidal activity of formalin administered for antifungal treatments. flavobacterium psychrophilum, the cause of bacterial coldwater disease, was isolated from the interior of 23.6, 18.1, and 29.2% of the dead atlantic salmon eggs from penobscot river egg lots a-98, a-100, and a-101, respectively, and concentrations of this pathogen ranged from 1.0 × 10(3) to >5 × 10(8) cfu per gram of dead egg. flavobacterium psychrophilum was also isolated from 8.3, 26.7, and 10.0% of the dead eggs from naraguagus river egg lots n-158, n-161, and n-163, respectively, in which concentrations of this organism ranged from 1.0 × 10(3) to 7.5 × 10(8) cfu per gram of egg. this bacterium was also isolated from within 18.3% and 3.3% of the dead eggs from machias river egg lots m-128 and m-142, respectively, and its concentrations ranged from 1.0 × 10(3) to 1.5 × 10(8) cfu per gram of egg. the finding of f. psychrophilum from within these eggs is indicative of this pathogen's widespread and persistent prevalence in atlantic salmon in new england.  fish hatchery management is efficient tool in intensive fish culture. the vital requirements of fish hatchery, hatchery construction, concrete tank construction, nursery, rearing and production ponds, fish seed hatchery, hormone in fish spawning, hypophysation, compounds used for induced breeding, hormone administration, spawning and rearing, steps in artificial propagation, hatchery management, nursery management are basic elements in effective hatchery management. the article reviews these vital elements to re-awaken fish farmers, fisheries students private and public sectors in the formulation of fisheries policies.
follicular thyroid carcinoma (ftc) tends to metastasize to remote organs rather than local lymph nodes. separation of ftc from follicular thyroid adenoma (fta) relies on detection of vascular and/or capsular invasion. we investigated which vascular markers, cd31, cd34 and d2-40 (lymphatic vessel marker), can best evaluate vascular invasion and why ftc tends to metastasize via blood stream to remote organs. thirty two ftcs and 34 ftas were retrieved for evaluation. the average age of patients with fta was 8 years younger than ftc (p = 0.02). the female to male ratio for follicular neoplasm was 25:8. the average size of ftc was larger than fta (p = 0.003). fourteen of 32 (44%) ftcs showed venous invasion and none showed lymphatic invasion, with positive cd31 and cd34 staining and negative d2-40 staining of the involved vessels. the average number of involved vessels was 0.88 ± 1.29 with a range from 0 to 5, and the average diameter of involved vessels was 0.068 ± 0.027 mm. none of the 34 ftas showed vascular invasion. cd31 staining demonstrated more specific staining of vascular endothelial cells than cd34, with less background staining. we recommended using cd31 rather than cd34 and/or d2-40 in confirming/excluding vascular invasion in difficult cases. all identified ftcs with vascular invasions showed involvement of venous channels, rather than lymphatic spaces, suggesting that ftcs prefer to metastasize via veins to distant organs, instead of lymphatic vessels to local lymph nodes, which correlates with previous clinical observations.  we retrospectively analyzed the outcome of all patients who received their primary treatment for follicular thyroid cancer at the mayo clinic between 1946 and 1970. the diagnosis was confirmed by reexamination of preserved tissue specimens. the 57 female and 43 male patients (mean age, 53 years) underwent follow-up for a maximum of 32 years (mean, 17.4 years). all patients were treated surgically, and total removal of primary tumor was thought to have been accomplished in all but three. only 2 of the 88 patients without distant metastatic lesions at the time of initial diagnosis underwent ablation of the thyroid remnant. at the conclusion of the study, 52 patients had died, thyroid cancer being the cause of death in 19. on the basis of univariate survival analysis, age more than 50 years, tumor size that exceeded 3.9 cm, higher tumor grade, presence of marked vascular invasion, adjacent tissue invasion, and distant metastatic involvement at the time of initial diagnosis were associated with increased cancer mortality. multivariate analysis (by cox proportional hazards model), however, identified only age greater than 50 years, marked vascular invasion, and metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis to be independent predictors of follicular thyroid cancer-related mortality. patients with two or more of these predictors were classified as being high risk. these patients had 5- and 20-year survival rates of 47% and 8%, respectively; the corresponding survival data for the low-risk group were 99% at 5 years and 86% at 20 years. the identification of these risk groups may facilitate a more rational approach to treatment of follicular thyroid cancer.
in this paper, we use deep representation learning for model-based single-channel source separation (scss) and artificial bandwidth extension (abe). both tasks are ill-posed and source-specific prior knowledge is required. in addition to well-known generative models such as restricted boltzmann machines and higher order contractive autoencoders two recently introduced deep models, namely generative stochastic networks (gsns) and sum-product networks (spns), are used for learning spectrogram representations. for scss we evaluate the deep architectures on data of the 2 nd chime speech separation challenge and provide results for a speaker dependent, a speaker independent, a matched noise condition and an unmatched noise condition task. gsns obtain the best pesq and overall perceptual score on average in all four tasks. similarly, frame-wise gsns are able to reconstruct the missing frequency bands in abe best, measured in frequency-domain segmental snr. they outperform spns embedded in hidden markov models and the other representation models significantly.  we present a signal processing algorithm to convert speech signals with "standard telephone" quality into 7 khz wideband speech. a statistical approach based on a hidden markov model (hmm) is used, which takes into account several features of the band-limited speech. the narrowband input signal is classified into a limited number of speech sounds (hmm states) for which the wideband spectral envelope is estimated using the pre-trained model. the enhanced speech exhibits a significantly improved quality without objectionable artifacts.
this paper investigates whether japanese banks had been following herd behavior in the domestic loan market from 1975 through 2000. applying the technique developed by lakonishok, shleifer, and vishny [lakonishok, j., shleifer, a., vishny, r.v., 1992. the impact of institutional trading on stock prices, j. finan. econ. 32, 23-43] to the data from loans outstanding to different types of borrowers, we obtain evidence indicative of the existence of herding. city banks in japan had been following a cyclical pattern of herding with one of the peaks around the bubble period in the late 1980s. adjusting further for herding resulting from rational behavior, evidence indicative of the existence of irrational herding was observed only in the bubble period. our estimate indicates that a total of some 5 trillion yen of loan increase by city banks during the period of 1987-1989 can be attributed to irrational herd behavior. the results imply that irrational bank behavior in the late 1980s might have contributed to the problems japanese banks had with non-performing loans. we also obtained evidence for herding among regional banks and among geographically proximate banks.  in a rational profit-maximizing world, banks should msdntain a credit policy of lending if and only if borrowers have positive net present value projects. why then are changes in credit policy seemingly correlated with changes in the condition of those demanding credit? this paper argues that rational bank managers with short horizons will set credit policies that influence and are influenced by other banks and demand side conditions. this leads to a theory of low frequency business cycles driven by bank credit policies. evidence from the banking crisis in new england in the early 1990s is consistent with the assumptions and predictions of the theory.
objectives the purpose of this study was to provide insight into the potential for left atrium (la) to aortic mechanical circulatory support as a treatment for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (hfpef).   background although hfpef arises from different etiologies, 1 hallmark of all forms of this syndrome is a small or minimally-dilated left ventricle (lv). consequently, the use of traditional mechanical circulatory support in end-stage patients has been difficult. in contrast, hfpef is also characterized by a large la.   methods hemodynamic characteristics of 4 distinct hfpef phenotypes were characterized from the published data: 1) hypertrophic cardiomyopathies; 2) infiltrative diseases; 3) nonhypertrophic hfpef; and 4) hfpef with common cardiovascular comorbidities (e.g., hypertension). employing a previously-described cardiovascular simulation, the effects of a low-flow, micropump-based la decompression device were modeled. the effect of sourcing blood from the lv versus the la was compared.   results for all hfpef phenotypes, mechanical circulatory support significantly increased cardiac output, provided a mild increase in blood pressure, and markedly reduced pulmonary and la pressures. lv sourcing of blood reduced lv end-systolic volume into a range likely to induce suction. with la sourcing, however, lv end-systolic volume increased compared with baseline. due to pre-existing la enlargement, la volumes remained sufficiently elevated, thus minimizing the risk of suction.   conclusions this theoretical analysis suggests that a strategy involving pumping blood from the la to the arterial system may provide a viable option for end-stage hfpef. special considerations apply to each of the 4 types of hfpef phenotypes described. finally, an hfpef-specific clinical profile scoring system (such as that of intermacs [interagency registry for mechanically assisted circulatory support]) would aid in the selection of patients with the appropriate risk-benefit ratio for implantation of an active pump.  background the current classification of patients with new york heart association class iv symptoms does not offer adequate description to allow optimal selection of patients for the current options of medical and pacing therapies, cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support.   methods seven clinical profiles and an arrhythmia modifier were developed and implemented into the first year of data collection for the interagency registry for mechanically assisted circulatory support (intermacs). the intermacs coordinators' council provided ongoing feedback regarding the characterization of patients receiving implantable devices.   results the definition of 7 clinical profiles revealed that 80% of current devices are being used in the 2 profiles with the highest levels of clinical compromise. the intermacs coordinators' council helped to identify gaps in the characterization of hospitalized patients on temporary assist devices and of homebound patients with resting symptoms, which has led to revised definitions of profile 3 and 4 and the addition of 2 new modifiers, for temporary circulatory support devices in the hospital, and for frequent rehospitalization of patients at home.   conclusions patients considered for mechanical circulatory support can now be classified using the 7 profiles plus 3 modifiers developed through intermacs. further understanding these profiles and their impact on outcome should help to better select patients and therapies in the advanced stages of disease.
backgroundclinical trial registries can improve the validity of trial results by facilitating comparisons between prospectively planned and reported outcomes. previous reports on the frequency of planned and reported outcome inconsistencies have reported widely discrepant results. it is unknown whether these discrepancies are due to differences between the included trials, or to methodological differences between studies. we aimed to systematically review the prevalence and nature of discrepancies between registered and published outcomes among clinical trials.methodswe searched medline via pubmed, embase, and cinahl, and checked references of included publications to identify studies that compared trial outcomes as documented in a publicly accessible clinical trials registry with published trial outcomes. two authors independently selected eligible studies and performed data extraction. we present summary data rather than pooled analyses owing to methodological heterogeneity among the included studies.resultstwenty-seven studies were eligible for inclusion. the overall risk of bias among included studies was moderate to high. these studies assessed outcome agreement for a median of 65 individual trials (interquartile range [iqr] 25–110). the median proportion of trials with an identified discrepancy between the registered and published primary outcome was 31 %; substantial variability in the prevalence of these primary outcome discrepancies was observed among the included studies (range 0 % (0/66) to 100 % (1/1), iqr 17–45 %). we found less variability within the subset of studies that assessed the agreement between prospectively registered outcomes and published outcomes, among which the median observed discrepancy rate was 41 % (range 30 % (13/43) to 100 % (1/1), iqr 33–48 %). the nature of observed primary outcome discrepancies also varied substantially between included studies. among the studies providing detailed descriptions of these outcome discrepancies, a median of 13 % of trials introduced a new, unregistered outcome in the published manuscript (iqr 5–16 %).conclusionsdiscrepancies between registered and published outcomes of clinical trials are common regardless of funding mechanism or the journals in which they are published. consistent reporting of prospectively defined outcomes and consistent utilization of registry data during the peer review process may improve the validity of clinical trial publications.  purposein 2005 the international committee of medical journal editors issued a requirement that all randomized controlled trials (rcts) be registered primarily to prevent selective reporting (publication bias). however, registries allow for alterations in study protocol. changes occurring before (or after) study completion could invalidate the original study intent, leading to publication of misleading conclusions. in rcts involving critically ill patients, these concerns may be particularly acute because mortality is high and conditions investigated are usually syndromes rather than specific diseases. this study was conducted to estimate the registration rate of rcts in critical care; and, among registered rcts, to determine timing of registration and whether sample size or primary outcome were altered.methodswe searched the medline database for rcts that began after or continued through july 2005. we determined whether each trial had been registered and, for registered trials, compared registry data to data in the published manuscript.resultsapproximately two-thirds (66 %) of trials were registered. of these, 66 % of registrations occurred after enrolment had commenced. overall, 6 % (5/90) of trials appropriately registered a sample size which was unchanged from the interval between registration and publication, and only 12 % (11/90) reported primary outcomes that were both appropriately registered and unchanged.conclusionsnon-registration, or registration after trial initiation, are common in rcts of critically ill patients. among registered trials important protocol changes are often made between trial commencement and publication. this study identifies and quantifies the extent of this serious—but correctable—problem for rcts in critically ill patients.
operation of wastewater treatment plants (wwtp) is a really challenging problem from the point of view of being an industry process that does not deliver any turnover. instead, the costs of operation are always to be faced against the environmental benefits. it is from this point of view that any control and operation formulation that includes economic considerations may provide useful perspectives on this respect. this work proposes the implementation of dynamic real time optimization (d-rto) integrating the economic optimization into non-linear model predictive control (nmpc) techniques for improving the operation of wwtps.  abstract activated sludge wastewater treatment processes are difficult to be controlled because of their complex and nonlinear behavior, however, the control of the dissolved oxygen level in the reactors plays an important role in the operation of the facility. for this reason a new approach is studied in this paper using simulated case-study approach: model predictive control (mpc) has been applied to control the dissolved oxygen concentration in an aerobic reactor of a wastewater treatment plant. the control strategy is investigated and evaluated on two examples using systematic evaluation criteria: in a simulation benchmark – developed for the evaluation of different control strategies – the oxygen concentration has to be maintained at a given level in an aerobic basin; and a changing oxygen concentration in an alternating activated sludge process is controlled using mpc technique. the effect of some mpc tuning parameters (prediction horizon, input weight, sampling time) are also investigated. the results show that mpc can be effectively used for dissolved oxygen control in wastewater treatment plants.
although physical activity (pa) has been inversely associated with depressive symptoms, it is not clear whether regular pa and television watching are associated with clinical depression risk. the authors conducted a prospective analysis involving 49,821 us women from the nurses' health study who were free from depressive symptoms at baseline (1996). information on pa was obtained from validated questionnaires completed in 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000; analyses were conducted using the cumulative average of pa (minutes/day) with a 2-year latency period applied. participants were asked about television-watching habits in 1992. cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for multiple risk factors were used to estimate relative risks of clinical depression (self-reported physician-diagnosed depression or use of antidepressants). during 10 years of follow-up (1996-2006), 6,505 incident cases of depression were documented. higher levels of pa were associated with lower depression risk. the multivariate relative risk comparing the highest level of pa (≥ 90 minutes/day) with the lowest (<10 minutes/day) was 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.70, 0.92; p(trend) < 0.001). in contrast, the risk of depression increased with increasing television-watching time. the multivariate relative risk comparing women who spent 21 hours/week or more watching television with those who spent 0-1 hour/week was 1.13 (95% confidence interval: 1.00, 1.27; p(trend) = 0.01). analyses simultaneously considering pa and television watching suggested that both contributed independently to depression risk.  background: a growing body of evidence suggests that physical activity might reduce the risk of depressive symptoms, but there are limited data on black women.purpose: the objective was to evaluate the association between leisure time physical activity and depressive symptoms in u.s. black women.methods: participants included 35,224 women ages 21 to 69 from the blackwomen’s health study, a follow-up study of african american women in which data are collected biennially by mail questionnaire.women answered questions on past and current exercise levels at baseline (1995) and follow-up (1997). the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (ces-d) was used to measure depressive symptoms in 1999. women who reported a diagnosis of depression before 1999 were excluded. we used multivariate logistic regression models to compute odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for physical activity in relation to depressive symptoms (ces-d score <= 16) with control for potential confounders.results: adult vigorous physical activity was inversely associated with depressive symptoms. women who reported vigorous exercise both in high school (<= 5 hr per week) and adulthood (<= 2 hr per week) had the lowest odds of depressive symptoms (or = 0.76, 95% ci = 0.71−0.82) relative to never active women; the or was 0.90 for women who were active in high school but not adulthood (95% ci = 0.85-0.96) and 0.83 for women who were inactive in high school but became active in adulthood (95% ci = 0.77-0.91). although walking for exercise was not associated with risk of depressive symptoms overall, there was evidence of a weak inverse relation among obese women (body mass index <= 30).conclusions: leisure time vigorous physical activity was associated with a reduced odds of depressive symptoms in u.s. black women.
backgroundthe ability to estimate durations in the seconds-to-minutes range - interval timing - is essential for survival, adaptation and its impairment leads to severe cognitive and/or motor dysfunctions. the response rate near a memorized duration has a gaussian shape centered on the to-be-timed interval (criterion time). the width of the gaussian-like distribution of responses increases linearly with the criterion time, i.e., interval timing obeys the scalar property.resultswe presented analytical and numerical results based on the striatal beat frequency (sbf) model showing that parameter variability (noise) mimics behavioral data. a key functional block of the sbf model is the set of oscillators that provide the time base for the entire timing network. the implementation of the oscillators block as simplified phase (cosine) oscillators has the additional advantage that is analytically tractable. we also checked numerically that the scalar property emerges in the presence of memory variability by using biophysically realistic morris-lecar oscillators. first, we predicted analytically and tested numerically that in a noise-free sbf model the output function could be approximated by a gaussian. however, in a noise-free sbf model the width of the gaussian envelope is independent of the criterion time, which violates the scalar property. we showed analytically and verified numerically that small fluctuations of the memorized criterion time leads to scalar property of interval timing.conclusionsnoise is ubiquitous in the form of small fluctuations of intrinsic frequencies of the neural oscillators, the errors in recording/retrieving stored information related to criterion time, fluctuation in neurotransmitters’ concentration, etc. our model suggests that the biological noise plays an essential functional role in the sbf interval timing.  humans and other animals demonstrate the ability to perceive and respond to temporally relevant information with characteristic behavioral properties. for example, the response time distributions in peak-interval timing tasks are well described by gaussian functions, and superimpose when scaled by the criterion duration. this superimposition has been referred to as the scalar property and results from the fact that the standard deviation of a temporal estimate is proportional to the duration being timed. various psychological models have been proposed to account for such responding. these models vary in their success in predicting the temporal control of behavior as well as in the neurobiological feasibility of the mechanisms they postulate. a review of the major interval timing models reveals that no current model is successful on both counts. the neurobiological properties of the basal ganglia, an area known to be necessary for interval timing and motor control, suggests that this set of structures act as a coincidence detector of cortical and thalamic input. the hypothesized functioning of the basal ganglia is similar to the mechanisms proposed in the beat frequency timing model [r.c. miall, neural computation 1 (1989) 359-371], leading to a reevaluation of its capabilities in terms of behavioral prediction. by implementing a probabilistic firing rule, a dynamic response threshold, and adding variance to a number of its components, simulations of the striatal beat frequency model were able to produce output that is functionally equivalent to the expected behavioral response form of peak-interval timing procedures.
ants are dominant members of many terrestrial ecosystems and are regarded as indicators of environmental changes. however, little is known about the effects of invasive alien plants on ant populations, particularly as regards the density, spatial distribution and size of ant colonies, as well as their foraging behaviour. we addressed these questions in a study of grassland ant communities on five grasslands invaded by alien goldenrods (solidago sp.) and on five non-invaded grasslands without this plant. in each grassland, seven 100 m2 plots were selected and the ant colonies counted. ant species richness and colony density was lower in the plots on the invaded grasslands. moreover, both of these traits were higher in the plots near the grassland edge and with a higher number of plant species in the grasslands invaded by goldenrods but not in the non-invaded ones. on average, ant colony size was lower on the invaded grasslands than the non-invaded ones. also, ant workers travelled for longer distances to collect food items in the invaded areas than they did in the non-invaded ones, even after the experimental removal of some ant colonies in order to exclude the effect of higher colony density in the latter. our results indicate that invasive alien goldenrods have a profound negative effect on grassland ant communities which may lead to a cascade effect on the whole grassland ecosystem through modification of the interactions among species. the invasion diminishes a major index of the fitness of ants, which is a colony’s size, and probably leads to increased foraging effort of workers. this, in turn, may have important consequences for the division of labour and reproductive strategies within ant colonies.  abstract.a method to estimate the number of workers in myrmica ant nests on abandoned meadows was developed based on removal of workers. ant workers have a tendency to climb up on wooden sticks put into their nests, therefore, assuming that the number of workers removed on sticks is related to the total number of workers within the nests, regression models for myrmica rubra, m. ruginodis and m. scabrinodis may be built. we used a general regression model to perform a backward stepwise elimination of explanatory variables. these were the number of workers removed on sticks, temperature at the nest and site (a categorical variable). in case of each species the final model contained only the number of workers removed as a significant variable. the method is apparently non-destructive as we did not observe decreased survival of nests surveyed as compared to control nests. the method can be a very useful tool in population studies of ants as well as in biodiversity projects, where ants are used as bioinidcators.
homologous recombination requires nucleolytic degradation (resection) of dna double‐strand break (dsb) ends. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mrx complex and sae2 are involved in the onset of dsb resection, whereas extensive resection requires exo1 and the concerted action of dna2 and sgs1. here, we show that the checkpoint protein rad9 limits the action of sgs1/dna2 in dsb resection by inhibiting sgs1 binding/persistence at the dsb ends. when inhibition by rad9 is abolished by the sgs1‐ss mutant variant or by deletion of rad9, the requirement for sae2 and functional mrx in dsb resection is reduced. these results provide new insights into how early and long‐range resection is coordinated.  abstract the mre11 complex is a central component of the dna damage response, with roles in damage sensing, molecular bridging, and end resection. we have previously shown that in saccharomyces cerevisiae, ku70 (yku70) deficiency reduces the ionizing radiation sensitivity of mre11δ mutants. in this study, we show that yku70 deficiency suppressed the camptothecin (cpt) and methyl methanesulfonate (mms) sensitivity of nuclease-deficient mre11-3 and sae2δ mutants in an exo1-dependent manner. cpt-induced g2/m arrest, γ-h2ax persistence, and chromosome breaks were elevated in mre11-3 mutants. these outcomes were reduced by yku70 deficiency. given that the genotoxic effects of cpt are manifest during dna replication, these data suggest that ku limits exo1-dependent double-strand break (dsb) resection during dna replication, inhibiting the initial processing steps required for homology-directed repair. we propose that mre11 nuclease- and sae2-dependent dna end processing, which initiates dsb resection prevents ku from engaging dsbs, thus promoting exo1-dependent resection. in agreement with this idea, we show that ku affinity for binding to short single-stranded overhangs is much lower than for blunt dna ends. collectively, the data define a nonhomologous end joining (nhej)-independent, s-phase-specific function of the ku heterodimer.
a number of studies have demonstrated high coordination of the hand grip force (gf; normal component of force acting at the digits-object contact area) and load force (lf; tangential component) in a variety of manipulation tasks. the aim of the study was to explore the mainly neglected effect of the change in lf direction and the effect of handedness on gf and lf coordination in bimanual manipulation task. subjects (n = 14) exerted a bimanual sinusoidal lf pattern against externally fixed handles in trials that gradually changed from unidirectional (lf exerted only in one direction) to fully bidirectional (equal lf peaks in two opposite directions). despite the gradual change of lf, unidirectional trials demonstrated high indices of force coordination, while in all bidirectional trials, no matter how low and brief lf exertion was in the opposite direction, all indices of gf and lf coordination deteriorated to a considerably lower level. the non-dominant hand demonstrated both a higher directional accuracy of exerting lf and higher gf modulation than the dominant one. we concluded that manipulation tasks performed in a single and two alternating directions may be based on partly distinctive neural control mechanisms, as well as that a switching of muscle synergies required in bidirectional tasks could play a role in the observed phenomenon. regarding the effect of hand dominance, the recorded advantage of the non-dominant hand could be considered as an addition to the current views of the non-dominant arm/hemisphere specialization in controlling limb position.  the purpose of the study was to evaluate a method for testing bimanual prehension based on a novel experimental device. the device consists of two handles allowing for simultaneous measurement of bimanual hand grip forces (gf) and different patterns of load forces (lf) exerted during compression and tension along the longitudinal axis. in order to assess the reliability of the obtained measures, eight healthy subjects were tested over three consecutive test, while three moderately impaired neurological patients were tested once. in healthy subjects, high coordination was observed between gfs and lfs, as well as between two gfs and two lfs. the results also suggest a satisfactory task performance in regards to exerting the instructed lf profile, as well as a sufficient, but not excessive gf. the reliability of most of the assessed variables proved to be either moderate or high. when compared to healthy subjects, the data obtained from neurological patients mainly revealed irregular patterns of lfs, excessive gfs, as well as a relatively weak relationship between gfs and lfs. it was concluded that the evaluated methodological approach can be applied not only to explore uni- and bi-manual coordination of arm and hand grip forces in various prehensile activities, but also to serve as a basis for future development of specific clinical tests for neurological patients and other populations that demonstrate impaired hand function.
rats have a natural tendency to spend more time exploring novel objects than familiar objects, and this preference can be used as an index of object recognition. rats also show an exploratory preference for objects in locations where they have not previously encountered objects (an index of place memory) and for familiar objects in contexts different from those in which the objects were originally encountered (an index of context memory). in this experiment, rats with cytotoxic lesions of the hippocampal formation were tested on all three versions of the novelty-preference paradigm, with a 5-min retention interval between the familiarization and test phases. rats with sham lesions displayed a novelty preference on all three trial types, whereas the rats with hippocampal lesions displayed a novelty preference on object trials but did not discriminate between the objects on place trials or context trials. the findings indicate that hippocampal damage impairs memory for contextual or spatial aspects of an experience, whereas memory for objects that were part of the same experience are left relatively intact.  based on behavioral procedures aimed at measuring working or data-based memory for spatial location, response, and visual object information, it is shown that there is a triple dissociation among the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and extrastriate visual cortex in mediating spatial location, response, and visual object information, respectively. the hippocampus appears to subserve only spatial location, the caudate nucleus only response, and the extrastriate visual cortex only visual object information. the results support the neurobiological foundation of the attribute memory model.
in order to assess the orientation of the orbit of bahinia, a middle eocene fossil from mynamar that has been interpreted as an anthropoid, laser surface scanning was used to develop three-dimensional models of the one facial specimen of bahinia for comparison with notharctus and rooneyia, examples of a relatively early strepsirhine and haplorhine, respectively. paired 3d montages were produced by graphically resizing bahinia to the same molar lengths as the reference fossils and aligning them according to the contour and position of the inferior orbital margin. the composites indicate that while the orbit of bahinia appears to be relatively small, as previously reported, its placement more closely resembles the laterally facing orbit of notharctus than the anteriorly facing orbit of rooneyia, which resembles anthropoids. in the size and shape of the snout, depth of the maxilla, and orientation of the toothrow in the face, bahinia shares a distinctive resemblance with notharctus, not with rooneyia. since the dental and gnathic features presented as evidence that bahinia is an anthropoid also are often found among adapiforms, in which case they are generally understood to be convergent similarities to some anthropoid characters, we conclude that a more cogent argument can be made that bahinia is a strepsirhine, with a large face and small, laterally facing orbits. bahinia thus contributes little to the argument that the chinese eosimiids are anthropoids. introduction j et al. (1999) described bahinia pondaungensis from three associated specimens—a moderately large left and right maxilla and a lower jaw—recovered from the middle eocene pondaung formation of myanmar. they viewed the species as an early anthropoid, citing features relating to mandibular morphology, upper incisor orientation, obliquity of lower premolars, trigonid cusp structure, and hypocone development. several studies have since accepted this interpretation (e.g., beard 2002; chaimanee et al. 2000; kay et al. 2004; marivaux et al. 2005; takai et al. 2005) without reservation and none of the features invoked by jaeger et al. (1999) have been reassessed or challenged in detail, with the exception of the character analysis by gunnell and miller (2001). this defining list of traits overlaps considerably the battery of features long used to support the adapid-anthropoid hypothesis and now regarded as likely convergences (e.g., rosenberger et al. 1985). kay et al. (2004) also added to the basic argument of jaeger et al. (1999) by suggesting that the orbit of bahinia, as inferred from the radius of curvature of its inferior margin, was relatively small as in typical anthropoids. the thrust of this work has led to the inclusion of bahinia in the family eosimiidae, and this has had two seemingly contradictory effects: 1) adding credibility to the hypothesis that eosimiids are anthropoids; and, 2) expanding the morphological concept of eosimiids to embrace highly disparate tooth and mandibular morphologies, i.e., creatpaleoanthropology 2007: 26−30. copyright © 2007 paleoanthropology society. all rights reserved. alfred l. rosenberger department of anthropology and archaeology, brooklyn college, cuny, 2900 bedford ave., brooklyn, ny 11210 usa, and department of mammalogy/nycep, american museum of natural history, central park west & 79th street, new york, ny 10024 usa; alfredr@brooklyn. cuny.edu russell hogg department of anthropology/nycep, city university of new york graduate center, 365 fifth avenue, new york, ny 10016 usa; hogg@nycep. org ing the impression of eosimiids as a morphologically diverse group (see beard 2002). however, as perhaps the literature’s sole doubters, miller et al. (2005) noted that the case for bahinia being an anthropoid is tied to the status of eosimias, whose anthropoid affinities they tend to question. and, in the parsimony analysis of seiffert et al. (2005), bahinia fell immediately outside a clade comprised of definitive anthropoids plus amphipithecids, while eosimias and the allied phenacopithecus (plus the controversial altiatlasius) were linked as another lineage further outside that group. the right maxilla of bahinia preserves the morphology of the snout and an integral segment of the orbit (kay et al. 2004: figure 8). the specimen is full of cracks and has probably suffered some distortion via bilateral compression and displacement of fragments high up between the orbit and nasal aperture. nevertheless, it appears to preserve a faithful approximation of the shape of the lateral aspect of the face, especially in the maxillary region between toothrow and orbit. the segment of the inferior orbital margin that kay et al. (2004) used as a basis for judging orbit size remains fairly intact. we have focused on that anatomical remnant as a basis for asking a question that may have important bearing on the affinities of the genus: what was the orientation of the orbits in the face? as is well known, anthropoids have orbits that are both relatively small and markedly convergent and frontated (see cartmill 1980; ross 1995) rather than laterally facing. affinities of bahinia • 27 materials and methods in the absence of a reference midline or standard horizontal on the fossil from which the angles describing the orbital plane can be easily measured as intersections (e.g., ross 1995), we developed an alternative comparative graphical approach to the problem. we compared the shapes of comparable parts of the faces and maxillae in the genera bahinia, notharctus, and rooneyia by using fixed-point overlays of 3d models based on laser surface scans of sharp epoxy casts. notharctus and rooneyia were selected as models for several reasons. all three are relatively small-eyed. their eocene ages makes for a pointed comparison with the middle eocene bahinia and it also means that their morphology is more likely to reflect the primitive states of early euprimate clades than any modern forms. from a systematics perspective, each of the analogs also represents a major euprimate division. notharctus was used as an example of the strepsirhine condition, where the orbits tend to be laterally directed, while rooneyia was used as an exemplar of a small-eyed haplorhine. ross (1995) also has shown that rooneyia is essentially indistinguishable from anthropoids in orbital orientation, so it serves as a good surrogate for an anthropoid. following rosenberger (2006; see also hogg et al. 2005), rooneyia has even more relevance for anthropoid origins than being merely a morphological model because there are other derived features of the frontal bone and orbital region which suggest that this genus may represent the sister-group of anthropoids, protoanthropoidea, rather than an omomyid (as it is often classified) of more remote affinities. we developed 3d digital models of the specimens and compared them visually by generating fixed-point overlays on-screen using the inferior orbital margins as a common reference surface. the models were constructed by renderfigure 1. a composite of two 3d models based on laser surface scans of notharctus and bahinia. red arrows mark the position of the notharctus canine. all the images are of the same composite, shown here in four different views (clockwise from top left—three quarters, superior, anterior, and palatal). the notharctus skull is not distorted on the right side. molars of the two fossils were scaled to approximately the same mesiodistal length and the composite was produced by fixed-point alignment of the inferior margins of the orbits in the specimens. the size and shape of bahinia conforms well with notharctus in the snout, the lateral aspect of the face below the orbit, and the toothrow. the canine falls short of the notharctus canine due to different premolar proportions, but the right toothrows are aligned fairly well. overall, the complimentary match between the shapes of these specimens indicates that their orbits are arranged similarly. 28 • paleoanthropology 2007 ing a solid surface from the coordinate points collected by a high-resolution laser scanner as it mapped the morphology of the specimens. the thickness of each model’s rendered surface is negligible, less than 1mm. to accommodate differences in the absolute sizes of the species, we resized the digital models of bahinia to the same molar lengths of notharctus and rooneyia, respectively, in each set of comparisons, thus scaling the entire solid model isomorphically in length, breadth, and height dimensions. this technique is similar to the long standing method of illustrating specimens as 2d flat images brought to a standard anatomical length or breadth, with the original aspect ratio of each maintained and aligning them symmetrically on a page. analysis figures 1 and 2 compare bahinia with notharctus and rooneyia in a set of 3d composite models, shown from different angles. these composites were developed by joining pairs of 3d models along the matching arcs of their inferior orbital margins. because the margin is an arc that crosses the three orthogonal standard anatomical planes, matching them in three-space has the effect of also “forcing” the alignment of other anatomical features, such as the toothrows. mismatches between anatomical structures would thus be an indication that specimens have different shapes. the generally close correspondence of the bahinia facial specimen with the snout shapes of notharctus and rooneyia adds confidence to the supposition that the bahinia specimen is not blatantly distorted in places where it counts most for this study, in the suborbital region. furthermore, close inspection of the direct congruity between the contours of the inferior orbital margin of bahinia and the other fossils in these graphic comparisons corroborates the interpretation of kay et al. (2004) that the orbit of bahinia was not enlarged. however, our observations also suggest that the orbits of bahinia were laterally oriented rather th  a new genus and species of anthropoid primate, bahinia pondaungensis gen. et sp. nov., is described from the yashe kyitchaung locality in the late middle eocene pondaung formation (myanmar). it is related to eosimias, but it is represented by more complete remains, including upper dentition with associated lower jaw fragment. it is interpreted as a new representative of the family eosimiidae, which corresponds to the sister group of the amphipithecidae and of all other anthropoids. eosimiidae are now recorded from three distinct middle eocene localities in asia, giving support to the hypothesis of an asian origin of anthropoids.
acid mine drainage (amd) is a global problem leading to the acidification of freshwaters, as well as contamination by heavy metals. the ability of humic substances (hs) such as humic acid (ha) to decrease toxicity of heavy metals is widely known, whereas limited studies have examined the ability of hs to decrease toxicity linked with multiple stressors such as those associated with amd. this study investigated the ability of ha to decrease acute toxicity defined as morbidity and ventilation frequency (measured via the time elapsed for ten operculum movements) in eastern rainbowfish (melanotaenia splendida splendida) exposed to the multiple stressors of amd-driven heavy metal concentrations, together with low ph. water from the mount morgan open pit (a now closed gold and copper mine site), located at mount morgan, central queensland, australia, was used as the amd source. fish were exposed to zero per cent (ph 7.3), two per cent (ph 6.7), three per cent (ph 5.7) and four per cent (ph 4.6) amd in the presence of 0, 10 and 20mg/l aldrich humic acid (aha) over 96h. ha was shown to significantly decrease the acute toxicity of amd and its adverse effects on ventilation frequency. these results are important in showing that ha can influence toxicity of metal mixtures and low ph, thus indicating a potential role for ha in decreasing toxicity of multiple environmental stressors more widely, and possible value as a rehabilitation aid.  humic substances (hs) have been shown to decrease the toxicity of environmental stressors, but knowledge of their ability to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors such as metal mixtures and low ph associated with acid mine drainage (amd) is still limited. the present study investigated the ability of hs to decrease toxicity of amd to mayflies (atalophlebia spp.). the amd was collected from the mount morgan (mount morgan, queensland, australia) open pit. mayflies were exposed to concentrations of amd at 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% in the presence of 0 mg/l, 10 mg/l, and 20 mg/l aldrich humic acid (aha). a u-shaped response was noted in all aha treatments, with higher rates of mortality recorded in the 2% and 3% dilutions compared with 4%. this result was linked with increased precipitates in the lower concentrations. a follow-up trial showed significantly higher concentrations of precipitates in the 2% and 3% amd dilutions in the 0 mg/l aha treatment and higher precipitates in the 2% amd, 10 mg/l and 20 mg/l aha, treatments. humic substances were shown to significantly increase survival of mayflies exposed to amd by up to 50% in the 20 mg/l aha treatment. humic substances may have led to increased survival after amd exposure through its ability to influence animal physiology and complex heavy metals. these results are valuable in understanding the ability of hs to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors.
the loss of atrx impairs dna repair, promoting glioma growth but enhancing sensitivity to dna-damaging therapies. aggressive gliomas’ achilles’ heel atrx is a protein that is often mutated in glioma, a lethal and relatively common brain tumor. koschmann et al. developed a mouse model of atrx-deficient glioma and discovered that these tumors grow more aggressively than their counterparts with wild-type atrx. the reason this happens is that the loss of atrx impairs dna repair, resulting in genetically unstable tumors that can accumulate oncogenic mutations more quickly. however, because of their dna repair defect, these tumors also proved to be more sensitive to treatments that damage the dna, such as radiation and some types of chemotherapy. consistent with these findings, the presence of atrx mutation correlated with better outcomes in patients, because these tumors were more susceptible to treatment. recent work in human glioblastoma (gbm) has documented recurrent mutations in the histone chaperone protein atrx. we developed an animal model of atrx-deficient gbm and showed that loss of atrx reduces median survival and increases genetic instability. further, analysis of genome-wide data for human gliomas showed that atrx mutation is associated with increased mutation rate at the single-nucleotide variant (snv) level. in mouse tumors, atrx deficiency impairs nonhomologous end joining and increases sensitivity to dna-damaging agents that induce double-stranded dna breaks. we propose that atrx loss results in a genetically unstable tumor, which is more aggressive when left untreated but is more responsive to double-stranded dna-damaging agents, resulting in improved overall survival.  glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) is a lethal brain tumour in adults and children. however, dna copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases. to explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric gbm samples. somatic mutations in the h3.3-atrx-daxx chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). recurrent mutations in h3f3a, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant h3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (k27m, g34r/g34v) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. mutations in atrx (α-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome x-linked) and daxx (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for h3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a g34r or g34v h3.3 mutation. somatic tp53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with h3f3a and/or atrx mutations. screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n = 784) showed h3f3a mutations to be specific to gbm and highly prevalent in children and young adults. furthermore, the presence of h3f3a/atrx-daxx/tp53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. this is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult gbm pathogenesis.
this study was designed to study effects of lung lavage versus the classical bolus instillation with a peptide‐based synthetic surfactant (lucinactant) in a model of meconium aspiration syndrome (mas). eighteen newborn lambs received meconium and were randomized to: the experimental meconium installation (emas) group—lambs with emas kept on conventional mechanical ventilation (control); the sf‐bolus group—emas receiving a lucinactant bolus (30 mg/ml); or the d‐sf‐lavage group—emas treated with dilute lucinactant bronchoalveolar lavage (10 mg/ml). systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, blood gases, and pulmonary mechanics were recorded for 180 min. in addition, the intrapulmonary distribution of the lucinactant was determined using dye‐labeled microspheres. following meconium instillation, severe hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, and pulmonary hypertension developed, and dynamic compliance decreased (50% from baseline). after lung lavage with dilute lucinactant, gas exchange significantly improved versus bolus instillation (p < 0.05). further, only in the lavage group did pulmonary arterial pressure return to basal values and dynamic compliance significantly increased. both lung lavage and bolus techniques for the administration of lucinactant resulted in a non‐uniform lung distribution. in conclusion, in newborn lambs with respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension induced by meconium, lung lavage with dilute lucinactant seems to be an effective and safe alternative for treatment for mas. pediatr. pulmonol. 2011; 46:991–999. © 2011 wiley‐liss, inc.  background. animal-derived, protein-containing surfactants seem to be superior to protein-free surfactants. lucinactant, a synthetic surfactant containing a surfactant protein-b peptide analog, has been shown to be effective in animal models and phase ii clinical trials. to date, lucinactant has not been compared with an animal-derived surfactant in a premature animal model. objective. the objective was to compare the acute and sustained effects of lucinactant among premature lambs with respiratory distress syndrome (rds) with the effects of a natural porcine surfactant (poractant-α). methods. after 5 minutes of mechanical ventilation twin premature lambs were assigned randomly to the lucinactant group (30 mg/ml, 5.8 ml/kg) or the poractant-α group (80 mg/ml, 2.2 ml/kg). heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, arterial ph, blood gas values, and lung mechanics were recorded for 12 hours. results. baseline fetal ph values were similar for the 2 groups (ph 7.27). after 5 minutes of mechanical ventilation, severe rds developed (ph: <7.08; paco2: >80 mm hg; pao2: <40 mm hg; dynamic compliance: <0.08 ml/cm h2o per kg). after surfactant instillation, similar improvements in gas exchange and lung mechanics were observed for the lucinactant and poractant-α groups at 1 hour (ph: 7.3 ± 0.1 vs 7.4 ± 0.1; paco2: 8 ± 18 mm hg vs 40 ± 8 mm hg; pao2: 167 ± 52 mm hg vs 259 ± 51 mm hg; dynamic compliance: 0.3 ± 0.1 ml/cm h2o per kg vs 0.3 ± 0.1 ml/cm h2o per kg). the improvements in lung function were sustained, with no differences between groups. cardiovascular profiles remained stable in both groups. conclusions. among preterm lambs with severe rds, lucinactant produced improvements in gas exchange and lung mechanics similar to those observed with a porcine-derived surfactant.
the stability of animal societies depends on individuals’ decisions about whether to tolerate or evict others and about whether to stay or leave. these decisions, in turn, depend on individuals’ costs and benefits of living in the group. the clown anemonefish, amphiprion percula, lives in groups composed of a breeding pair and zero to four non-breeders. to determine why breeders accept the presence of non-breeders in this species i investigated the effect of non-breeders on multiple components of the breeders’ fitness. non-breeders did not assist breeders in any obvious way. experimental removal of non-breeders had no significant effect on the survival, growth, or reproductive success of breeders. experimental removal of one of the breeding pair showed that non-breeders had little effect on the time taken for a widowed breeder to recommence breeding. the results indicate that the presence of non-breeders neither enhances, nor reduces, the fitness of breeders in a. percula. i suggest that non-breeders might modulate their effect on the fitness of breeders, either by reducing the costs they inflict or by increasing the benefits they provide, such that it just pays breeders to tolerate, rather than to evict, them. this study illustrates that animal societies can be stable even when some individuals gain nothing from the association.  conflicts of interest are part and parcel of living in a social group, although these can reduce the fitness of individual members. here i show that clownfish (amphiprion percula) adjust their size and growth rate according to their position in the group hierarchy, maintaining a well-defined size difference with respect to individuals above them in social rank. this strategy to prevent conflict is a surprising departure from the more usual ploy used by many animals of modifying their behaviour within the group.
abstract background current standards for fine particulates and nitrogen dioxide are under revision. patients with cardiovascular disease have been identified as the largest group which need to be protected from effects of urban air pollution. methods we sought to estimate associations between indicators of urban air pollution and daily mortality using time series of daily tsp, pm 10 , pm 2.5 , no 2 , so 2 , o 3 and nontrauma deaths in vienna (austria) 2000–2004. we used polynomial distributed lag analysis adjusted for seasonality, daily temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and incidence of influenza as registered by sentinels. results all three particulate measures and no 2 were associated with mortality from all causes and from ischemic heart disease and copd at all ages and in the elderly. the magnitude of the effect was largest for pm 2.5 and no 2 . best predictor of mortality increase lagged 0–7 days was pm 2.5 (for ischemic heart disease and copd) and no 2 (for other heart disease and all causes). total mortality increase, lagged 0–14 days, per 10 μg m −3 was 2.6% for pm 2.5 and 2.9% for no 2 , mainly due to cardiopulmonary and cerebrovascular causes. conclusion acute and subacute lethal effects of urban air pollution are predicted by pm 2.5 and no 2 increase even at relatively low levels of these pollutants. this is consistent with results on hospital admissions and the lack of a threshold. while harvesting (reduction of mortality after short increase due to premature deaths of most sensitive persons) seems to be of minor importance, deaths accumulate during 14 days after an increase of air pollutants. the limit values for pm 2.5 and no 2 proposed for 2010 in the european union are unable to prevent serious health effects.  air pollution consists of both gaseous and particulate-matter pollutants. the former include nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3), and sulphur dioxide (so2). the latter consist of particulate matter of varying aerodynamic diameter, as defined by cutoff points—for example, particles with diameters of ,10 mm (pm10) or ,2.5 mm (pm2.5). because of their small size, these particles can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and deposited in the alveoli. why should cardiologists care about ambient air? it has long been known that air pollution can adversely affect human health. extreme levels of pollution may cause markedly increased mortality rates; in this regard one often refers to the meuse valley fog of 1930 or the london smog of 1952. these episodes initiated successful efforts and legislation to reduce air pollution. nevertheless, even at current ambient pollution levels, the relation between pollution and excess morbidity and mortality still exists. however, the nature of the pollutants and the type of health effects have shifted, with a special emphasis now being placed on the heart rather than the lungs. maı̂tre et al. gathered the available epidemiological evidence on the association between coronary disease and air pollution at current ambient concentrations. from both biological and public health perspectives, one should distinguish between acute and long-term effects of air pollution.
sound and acceleration are detected by hair bundles, mechanosensory structures located at the apical pole of hair cells in the inner ear. the different elements of the hair bundle, the stereocilia and a kinocilium, are interconnected by a variety of link types. one of these links, the tip link, connects the top of a shorter stereocilium with the lateral membrane of an adjacent taller stereocilium and may gate the mechanotransducer channel of the hair cell. mass spectrometric and western blot analyses identify the tip-link antigen, a hitherto unidentified antigen specifically associated with the tip and kinocilial links of sensory hair bundles in the inner ear and the ciliary calyx of photoreceptors in the eye, as an avian ortholog of human protocadherin-15, a product of the gene for the deaf/blindness usher syndrome type 1f/dfnb23 locus. multiple protocadherin-15 transcripts are shown to be expressed in the mouse inner ear, and these define four major isoform classes, two with entirely novel, previously unidentified cytoplasmic domains. antibodies to the three cytoplasmic domain-containing isoform classes reveal that each has a different spatiotemporal expression pattern in the developing and mature inner ear. two isoforms are distributed in a manner compatible for association with the tip-link complex. an isoform located at the tips of stereocilia is sensitive to calcium chelation and proteolysis with subtilisin and reappears at the tips of stereocilia as transduction recovers after the removal of calcium chelators. protocadherin-15 is therefore associated with the tip-link complex and may be an integral component of this structure and/or required for its formation.  tip links are extracellular, cell-surface-associated filaments of unknown molecular composition that are thought to gate the mechanotransducer channel of the sensory hair cell. they disappear from the hair bundle in response to calcium chelation and lanthanum treatment and resist degradation by the protease subtilisin. a monoclonal antibody derived from a hybridoma screen identified a novel antigen associated with tip links, the tip-link antigen. the tip-link antigen is also associated with kinocilial links, subtilisin-resistant filaments that are sensitive to calcium chelation and connect the kinocilium to the tallest stereocilia of the hair bundle. furthermore, the tip-link antigen is expressed in the retina, where it is associated with the ciliary calyx, a ring of microvilli that surrounds the outer segment of the photoreceptor. the tip-link antigen rapidly disappears from the surface of the hair bundle in response to calcium chelation. it is also subtilisin resistant, relative to the ankle-link antigen, an antigen associated with another type of hair bundle link. the tip-link antigen is lanthanum sensitive and, like tip links, reappears on the surface of the hair bundle after calcium chelation. the monoclonal antibody to the tip-link antigen immunoprecipitates two concanavalin a-reactive polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 200 and 250 kda from detergent extracts of the retina. these results provide the first identification of a cell surface antigen associated with tip links, indicate that tip links share properties in common with kinocilial links, and reveal a second epitope that, along with the ankle-link antigen, is common to both sensory hair bundles and the ciliary calyx of photoreceptors.
small heat-shock proteins (shsps) are a conserved group of molecular chaperones with important roles in cellular proteostasis. although shsps are characterized by their small monomeric weight, they typically assemble into large polydisperse oligomers that vary in both size and shape but are principally composed of dimeric building blocks. these assemblies can include different shsp orthologues, creating additional complexity that may affect chaperone activity. however, the structural and functional properties of such hetero-oligomers are poorly understood. we became interested in hetero-oligomer formation between human heat-shock protein family b (small) member 1 (hspb1) and hspb6, which are both highly expressed in skeletal muscle. when mixed in vitro, these two shsps form a polydisperse oligomer array composed solely of heterodimers, suggesting preferential association that is determined at the monomer level. previously, we have shown that the shsp n-terminal domains (ntds), which have a high degree of intrinsic disorder, are essential for the biased formation. here we employed iterative deletion mapping to elucidate how the ntd of hspb6 influences its preferential association with hspb1 and show that this region has multiple roles in this process. first, the highly conserved motif rlfdqxfg is necessary for subunit exchange among oligomers. second, a site ∼20 residues downstream of this motif determines the size of the resultant hetero-oligomers. third, a region unique to hspb6 dictates the preferential formation of heterodimers. in conclusion, the disordered ntd of hspb6 helps regulate the size and stability of hetero-oligomeric complexes, indicating that terminal shsp regions define the assembly properties of these proteins.  atp-independent small heat-shock proteins (shsps) are an essential component of the cellular chaperoning machinery. under both normal and stress conditions, shsps bind partially unfolded proteins and prevent their irreversible aggregation. canonical vertebrate shsps, such as the α-crystallins, form large polydisperse oligomers from which smaller, functionally active subspecies dissociate. here we focus on human hspb6 which, despite having considerable homology to the α-crystallins in both the n-terminal region and the signature α-crystallin domain (acd), only forms dimers in solution that represent the basic chaperoning subspecies. we addressed the three-dimensional structure and functional properties of hspb6 in a hybrid study employing x-ray crystallography, solution small-angle x-ray scattering (saxs), mutagenesis, size-exclusion chromatography and chaperoning assays. the crystal structure of a proteolytically stable fragment reveals typical acd dimers which further form tetrameric assemblies as a result of extensive inter-dimer patching of the β4/β8 grooves. the patching is surprisingly mediated by tripeptide motifs, found in the n-terminal domain directly adjacent to the acd, that are resembling but distinct from the canonical ixi sequence commonly binding this groove. by combining the crystal structure with saxs data for the full-length protein, we derive a molecular model of the latter. in solution, hspb6 shows a strong attractive self-interaction, a property that correlates with its chaperoning activity. both properties are dictated by the unstructured yet compact n-terminal domain, specifically a region highly conserved across vertebrate shsps.
oxidative stress is a major contributor to the secondary injury process after experimental traumatic brain injury (tbi). the importance of oxidative stress in the pathobiology of human tbi is largely unknown. the f(2)-isoprostane 8-iso-prostaglandin f(2α) (8-iso-pgf(2α)), synthesized in vivo through non-enzymatic free radical catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid, is a widely used biomarker of oxidative stress in multiple disease states, including tbi and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. our hypothesis is that harvesting of biomarkers directly in the injured brain by cerebral microdialysis (md) is advantageous because of its high spatial and temporal resolution compared to blood or cerebrospinal fluid sampling. the aim of this study was to test the feasibility of measuring 8-iso-pgf(2α) in md, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (vcsf), and plasma samples collected from patients with severe tbi, and to compare the md signals with md-glycerol, implicated as a biomarker of oxidative stress, as well as md-glutamate, a biomarker of excitotoxicity. six patients (4 men, 2 women) were included in the study, three of whom had a focal/mixed tbi, and three a diffuse axonal injury (dai). following the bedside analysis of routine md biomarkers (glucose, lactate:pyruvate ratio, glycerol, and glutamate), two 12-h md samples per day were used to analyze 8-iso-pgf(2α) from 24 h up to 8 days post-injury. the interstitial levels of 8-iso-pgf(2α) were markedly higher than the levels obtained from plasma and vcsf (p<0.05), supporting our hypothesis. the md-8-iso-pgf(2α) levels correlated strongly (p<0.05) with md-glycerol and md-glutamate, which are widely used biomarkers of membrane phospholipid degradation/oxidative stress and excitotoxicity, respectively. this study demonstrates the feasibility of analyzing 8-iso-pgf(2α) in md samples from the human brain. our results support a close relationship between oxidative stress and excitotoxicity following human tbi. md-8-iso-pgf(2α) in combination with md-glycerol may be useful biomarkers of oxidative stress in the neurointensive care setting.  mammalian cells express a transport system known as system xc−, which is an exchange agency specific for anionic forms of cystine and glutamate. system xc− activity is important to maintain both intracellular glutathione levels and the redox balance between cystine and cysteine in the extracellular milieu. we have shown that the cloned cdnas encoding the transporter for system xc− consist of two components, xct and the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen. in the present study, we have investigated the mrna distribution for these components in the mouse brain by in situ hybridization. the xct mrna was expressed in the area postrema, subfornical organ, habenular nucleus, hypothalamic area, and ependymal cells of the lateral wall of the third ventricle in the adult mouse brain. a strong signal was also detected in the meninges in both adult and fetal mouse brains. the mrna expression of the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen was detected in a more broad area, including all of the regions in which xct mrna was detected. these data are compatible with our biochemical evidence that xct functions in combination with the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen to elicit system xc− activity. the expression of system xc− in meninges and some circumventricular organs may suggest that this transporter contributes to the maintenance of the redox state (i.e., cysteine/cystine ratio) in the csf.
recent progress in semantic segmentation has been driven by improving the spatial resolution under fully convolutional networks (fcns). to address this problem, we propose a stacked deconvolutional network (sdn) for semantic segmentation. in sdn, multiple shallow deconvolutional networks, which are called as sdn units, are stacked one by one to integrate contextual information and bring the fine recovery of localization information. meanwhile, inter-unit and intra-unit connections are designed to assist network training and enhance feature fusion since the connections improve the flow of information and gradient propagation throughout the network. besides, hierarchical supervision is applied during the upsampling process of each sdn unit, which enhances the discrimination of feature representations and benefits the network optimization. we carry out comprehensive experiments and achieve the new state-ofthe- art results on four datasets, including pascal voc 2012, camvid, gatech, coco stuff. in particular, our best model without crf post-processing achieves an intersection-over-union score of 86.6% in the test set.  we present a novel algorithm for estimating the broad 3d geometric structure of outdoor video scenes. leveraging spatio-temporal video segmentation, we decompose a dynamic scene captured by a video into geometric classes, based on predictions made by region-classifiers that are trained on appearance and motion features. by examining the homogeneity of the prediction, we combine predictions across multiple segmentation hierarchy levels alleviating the need to determine the granularity a priori. we built a novel, extensive dataset on geometric context of video to evaluate our method, consisting of over 100 ground-truth annotated outdoor videos with over 20,000 frames. to further scale beyond this dataset, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework to expand the pool of labeled data with high confidence predictions obtained from unlabeled data. our system produces an accurate prediction of geometric context of video achieving 96% accuracy across main geometric classes.
we observe that the function introduced by z. tu and y. deng in the eprint archive paper 2009/272 is weak against fast algebraic attacks. we propose an alternative function sharing all the properties of the tu-deng function but having not this weakness.  after the improvement by courtois and meier of the algebraic attacks on stream ciphers and the introduction of the related notion of algebraic immunity, several constructions of infinite classes of boolean functions with optimum algebraic immunity have been proposed. all of them gave functions whose algebraic degrees are high enough for resisting the berlekamp-massey attack and the recent ronjom-helleseth attack, but whose nonlinearities either achieve the worst possible value (given by lobanov's bound) or are slightly superior to it. hence, these functions do not allow resistance to fast correlation attacks. moreover, they do not behave well with respect to fast algebraic attacks. in this paper, we study an infinite class of functions which achieve an optimum algebraic immunity. we prove that they have an optimum algebraic degree and a much better nonlinearity than all the previously obtained infinite classes of functions. we check that, at least for small values of the number of variables, the functions of this class have in fact a very good nonlinearity and also a good behavior against fast algebraic attacks.
purpose: the current standard of care for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer is a combination of androgen deprivation and radiation therapy. radiation is typically given with androgen suppression when testosterone levels are at their nadir. recent reports have shown that androgen stimulation of androgen-deprived prostate cancer cells leads to formation of double-strand breaks (dsb). here, we exploit this finding and investigate the extent and timing of androgen-induced dsbs and their effect on tumor growth following androgen stimulation in combination with ionizing radiation (ir). experimental design: androgen-induced dna damage was assessed by comet assays and γh2a.x foci formation. effects of androgen stimulation and radiation were determined in vitro and in vivo with xenograft models. results: we document that androgen treatment of androgen-deprived prostate cancer cell lines resulted in a dose- and time-dependent induction of widespread dsbs. generation of these breaks was dependent on androgen receptor and topoisomerase ii beta but not on cell-cycle progression. in vitro models demonstrated a synergistic interaction between ir and androgen stimulation when ir is given at a time point corresponding with high levels of androgen-induced dsb formation. furthermore, in vivo studies showed a significant improvement in tumor growth delay when radiation was given shortly after androgen repletion in castrated mice. conclusions: these results suggest a potential cooperative effect and improved tumor growth delay with androgen-induced dsbs and radiation with implications for improving the therapeutic index of prostate cancer radiation therapy. clin cancer res; 22(13); 3310–9. ©2016 aacr. see related commentary by chua and bristow, p. 3124  dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) can lead to the development of genomic rearrangements, which are hallmarks of cancer. fusions between tmprss2, encoding the transmembrane serine protease isoform 2, and erg, encoding the v-ets erythroblastosis virus e26 oncogene homolog, are among the most common oncogenic rearrangements observed in human cancer. we show that androgen signaling promotes co-recruitment of androgen receptor and topoisomerase ii beta (top2b) to sites of tmprss2-erg genomic breakpoints, triggering recombinogenic top2b-mediated dsbs. furthermore, androgen stimulation resulted in de novo production of tmprss2-erg fusion transcripts in a process that required top2b and components of the dsb repair machinery. finally, unlike normal prostate epithelium, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia cells showed strong coexpression of androgen receptor and top2b. these findings implicate androgen-induced top2b-mediated dsbs in generating tmprss2-erg rearrangements.
when fruits ripen, microbial communities start a fierce competition for the freely available fruit sugars. three yeast lineages, including baker’s yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, have independently developed the metabolic activity to convert simple sugars into ethanol even under fully aerobic conditions. this fermentation capacity, named crabtree effect, reduces the cell-biomass production but provides in nature a tool to out-compete other microorganisms. here, we analyzed over forty saccharomycetaceae yeasts, covering over 200 million years of the evolutionary history, for their carbon metabolism. the experiments were done under strictly controlled and uniform conditions, which has not been done before. we show that the origin of crabtree effect in saccharomycetaceae predates the whole genome duplication and became a settled metabolic trait after the split of the s. cerevisiae and kluyveromyces lineages, and coincided with the origin of modern fruit bearing plants. our results suggest that ethanol fermentation evolved progressively, involving several successive molecular events that have gradually remodeled the yeast carbon metabolism. while some of the final evolutionary events, like gene duplications of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes, have been deduced, the earliest molecular events initiating crabtree effect are still to be determined.  modern yeast living in fleshy fruits rapidly convert sugars into bulk ethanol through pyruvate. pyruvate loses carbon dioxide to produce acetaldehyde, which is reduced by alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (adh1) to ethanol, which accumulates. yeast later consumes the accumulated ethanol, exploiting adh2, an adh1 homolog differing by 24 (of 348) amino acids. as many microorganisms cannot grow in ethanol, accumulated ethanol may help yeast defend resources in the fruit. we report here the resurrection of the last common ancestor of adh1 and adh2, called adha. the kinetic behavior of adha suggests that the ancestor was optimized to make (not consume) ethanol. this is consistent with the hypothesis that before the adh1-adh2 duplication, yeast did not accumulate ethanol for later consumption but rather used adha to recycle nadh generated in the glycolytic pathway. silent nucleotide dating suggests that the adh1-adh2 duplication occurred near the time of duplication of several other proteins involved in the accumulation of ethanol, possibly in the cretaceous age when fleshy fruits arose. these results help to connect the chemical behavior of these enzymes through systems analysis to a time of global ecosystem change, a small but useful step towards a planetary systems biology.
lindmark, e. 2002. leukocytes and coronary artery disease. experimental and clinical studies. acta universitatis upsaliensis, comprehensive summaries of uppsala dissertations from the faculty of medicine 1110. 72 pp. uppsala. isbn 91-554-5204-3. tissue factor (tf) is the initiator of the coagulation cascade. monocytes do not normally express tf, but can be induced to do so by certain stimuli. aberrant tf expression is important in the thrombotic complications of bacterial sepsis, certain malignancies and coronary artery disease (cad). in this thesis, regulation of monocyte tf by cytokines and by interactions with other vascular cells were studied, as well as the activation of blood cells, inflammation and coagulation in cad patients and the association of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (il)-6 with prognosis in unstable cad. in a whole blood experimental system, the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 was shown to suppress lipopolysaccharide-induced tf expression in monocytes, whereas il-4 and il-13 did not, contrary to previous in vitro findings. activated platelets also induced monocyte tf in whole blood in a p-selectin-dependent manner, causing a rapid surface exposure of tf independent of mrna formation. the differentiated monocytic cell line u-937 displayed different kinetics of platelet-stimulated tf induction. in co-culture with cytokine-activated human coronary artery endothelial cells, u-937 cells expressed tf, and also il-6. the endothelial cells up-regulated their production of il10. simvastatin, enalapril and dalteparin, all commonly used drugs in cad treatment, suppressed tf induction but did not alter cytokine expression in co-cultures. in unstable cad, there was an activation of both coagulation and inflammation compared to stable cad that coincided with an increased activation of platelets and leukocytes. women had different patterns of cellular activation than men, indicating differences in pathogenetic mechanisms. plasma levels of il-6 above 5 ng/l proved to be a strong, independent marker for increased risk of death in a 6-12 month perspective in patients with unstable cad. this risk was significantly reduced by an early invasive strategy.  oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxldl) has been characterized as an atherogenic molecule responsible for the induction of a variety of gene products. one such gene, tissue factor (tf), the cellular initiator of the coagulation cascade, is not expressed in normal vascular tissue but is expressed by monocytes and foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions. therefore, we examined the effect of oxldl on tf expression in cultured human adherent monocytes. endotoxin-free oxldl alone did not induce tf expression in adherent monocytes. however, oxldl significantly enhanced tf expression induced by the inflammatory mediator, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps), in a time- and dose-dependent manner. in contrast, oxldl did not alter lps-mediated production of interleukin-8 and actually inhibited lps-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, suggesting that some aspects of the signaling pathways for tf induction differ from those of other lps-responsive monocyte/macrophage gene products. thus, this study documents specific modulation of the expression of lps-inducible genes in monocytic cells by oxldl. factors that enhance tf expression in monocyte/macrophage cells present in atheroma may contribute to the severity of thrombotic episodes and complications observed in atherosclerosis.
growing evidence indicates that alterations of neuroplasticity may contribute to the pathophysiology of depression. in contrast, various antidepressants increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis and block the effects of stress. these findings result in the ‘neurogenesis hypothesis of depression’. the present study seeks to determine out whether cell proliferation is altered in the hippocampus, subventricular zone (svz), and basolateral amygdala of adult rats exposed to bilateral olfactory bulbectomy, another established model of depression and, if so, how imipramine effects bulbectomy-induced changes of cell genesis. bulbectomy results in a significant reduction of cell proliferation in the hippocampus and svz, an effect that is normalized by subchronic doses of imipramine. moreover, an increase in cell genesis in the basolateral amygdala, which is not affected by imipramine, is demonstrated. tunel staining indicates an enhanced apoptosis after bulbectomy in the svz that cannot be reduced by imipramine. cell death rates in the hippocampus and amygdala are not affected by bulbectomy. the opposing effects of bulbectomy and imipramine treatment in the hippocampus and amygdala demonstrate that these structures of the limbic system, both integrated in emotional processing, react quite differently with regard to neuroplasticity. further to this, we discuss a possible link between the pathogenesis of depression and changed neuronal plasticity in the svz.  the main olfactory bulb (mob) is the first relay on the olfactory sensory pathway and the target of the neural progenitor cells generated in the subventricular zone (svz) lining the lateral ventricles and which migrate along the rostral extension of the svz, also called the rostral migratory stream (rms). within the mob, the neuroblasts differentiate into granular and periglomerular interneurons. a reduction in the number of granule cells during sensory deprivation suggests that neurogenesis may be influenced by afferent activity. here, we show that unilateral sensory deafferentation of the mob by axotomy of the olfactory receptor neurons increases apoptotic cell death in the svz and along the rostro-caudal extent of the rms. the vast majority of dying cells in the rms are migrating neuroblasts as indicated by double terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated utp nick-end labeling/psa-ncam labeling. counting bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells in animals killed immediately or 4 days after tracer administration showed a bilateral increase in proliferation in the svz and rms which was balanced by cell death on the operated side. these data suggest that olfactory inputs are required for the survival of newborn neural progenitors. the greatest enhancement in proliferation occurred in the extension of the rms located in the mob, revealing a population of local precursors mitotically stimulated following axotomy. together, these findings indicate that olfactory inputs may strongly modulate the balance between neurogenesis and apoptosis in the svz and rms and provide a model for further investigation of the underlying molecular mechanisms of this activity-dependent neuronal plasticity.
the optimal number of offspring for males and females may differ, as males and females invest differently in different aspects of reproduction. this creates potential for a sexual conflict leading to reduced residual reproductive value of the sex that experiences exploitation by the other sex. we experimentally investigated (by changing the brood size by one offspring) the effects of increased or decreased parental effort on the future local survival and breeding success of adult pied flycatchers (ficedula hypoleuca), and on the future expression of male ornamentation. in addition, we studied how experimentally changing the brood size affected offspring condition and their recruitment. we show that females (but not males) rearing enlarged broods had lower local survival compared to those rearing reduced or control broods. this indicates a sexual conflict concerning optimal brood size. however, even though brood size manipulation did not affect the local survival of males, it did have an influence on the dorsal melanin coloration of young males. young males rearing enlarged broods showed a stronger increase in plumage darkness from the current to the next breeding season than those rearing reduced or control broods. this suggests that stress experienced during reproduction might have carry-over effects that influence the complicated melanocortin system and lead to changes in the expression of melanin-based coloration. alternatively, successful breeding might have stimulated young males to further invest in reproduction in the following season. taken together these results indicate that both sexes are affected by brood demands, but in different ways.  a fundamental premise of life‐history theory is that organisms that increase current reproductive investment suffer increased mortality. possibly the most studied life‐history phenotypic relationship is the trade‐off between parental effort and survival. however, evidence supporting this trade‐off is equivocal. here, we conducted a meta‐analysis to test the generality of this tenet. using experimental studies that manipulated parental effort in birds, we show that (i) the effect of parental effort on survival was similar across species regardless of phylogeny; (ii) individuals that experienced reduced parental effort had similar survival probabilities than control individuals, regardless of sex; and (iii) males that experienced increased parental effort were less likely to survive than control males, whereas females that experienced increased effort were just as likely to survive as control females. our results suggest that the trade‐off between parental effort and survival is more complex than previously assumed. finally, our study provides recommendations of unexplored avenues of future research into life‐history trade‐offs.
it remains unclear whether the variability of neuronal spike trains in vivo arises due to biological noise sources or represents highly precise encoding of temporally varying synaptic input signals. determining the variability of spike timing can provide fundamental insights into the nature of strategies used in the brain to represent and transmit information in the form of discrete spike trains. in this study, we employ a signal estimation paradigm to determine how variability in spike timing affects encoding of random time-varying signals. we assess this for two types of spiking models: an integrate-and-fire model with random threshold and a more biophysically realistic stochastic ion channel model. using the coding fraction and mutual information as information-theoretic measures, we quantify the efficacy of optimal linear decoding of random inputs from the model outputs and study the relationship between efficacy and variability in the output spike train. our findings suggest that variability does not necessarily hinder signal decoding for the biophysically plausible encoders examined and that the functional role of spiking variability depends intimately on the nature of the encoder and the signal processing task; variability can either enhance or impede decoding performance.  cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. to investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. we analyzed a “high-input regime” in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. to produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. we find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50–100 neurons. these column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. we find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10–50 msec). finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons—that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. the solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources.
tumor suppressor in lung cancer 1 (tslc1) is tightly implicated in a variety of biological processes and plays critical roles in tumor development and progression. however, the roles of tslc1 in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cscc) remain to be unraveled. here, we reported the tslc1 gene that was significantly downregulated in cscc tissues and cells, and survival times of patients with tslc1 at a low level were markedly lower than that at a high level (p = 0.0070). a stepwise investigation demonstrated that an elevated tslc1 level evoked obvious proliferation and invasion inhibitions and arrested cell cycle at g0/g1 phase in a431 cells. moreover, increase of caspase-3 activity mediated by elevated tslc1 level induced cell apoptosis in a431 cells. most notably, upregulation of tslc1 expression reduced the numbers of colony formation and tumorigenicity. collectively, our results presented herein suggest that tslc1 as tumor suppressor may play prominent roles in development and progression of cscc via regulation of different biological processes.  chemo- and radio-therapeutic regimens frequently kill cancer cells by inducing apoptosis, a cell-death subroutine that involves the activation of a particular class of proteases called caspases. in a recent issue of nature medicine, huang et al. (2011) show that caspase activation in dying tumor cells causes the release of soluble lipid messengers, notably prostaglandin e2, that stimulate tumor cell proliferation. in this short review, we will discuss the clinical and therapeutic implications of these findings.
model-based languages such as matlab/simulink play an essential role in the model-driven development of software systems. to comply with new requirements, it is common practice to create new variants by copying existing systems and modifying them. commonly referred to as clone-and-own, severe problems arise in the long-run when no dedicated variability management is installed. to allow for a documented and structured reuse of systems, their variability information needs to be reverse-engineered. in this paper, we propose an advanced comparison procedure, the matching window technique, and a customizable metric. both allow us to overcome structural alterations commonly performed during clone-and-own. we analyze related matlab/simulink models and determine, classify and represent their variability information in an understandable way. with our technique, we assist model engineers in maintaining and evolving existing variants. we provide three feasibility studies with real-world models from the automotive domain and show our technique to be fast and precise. furthermore, we perform semi-structured interviews with domain experts to assess the potential applicability of our technique in practice.  case study is a suitable research methodology for software engineering research since it studies contemporary phenomena in its natural context. however, the understanding of what constitutes a case study varies, and hence the quality of the resulting studies. this paper aims at providing an introduction to case study methodology and guidelines for researchers conducting case studies and readers studying reports of such studies. the content is based on the authors’ own experience from conducting and reading case studies. the terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains, in particular social science and information systems, and adapted to the needs in software engineering. we present recommended practices for software engineering case studies as well as empirically derived and evaluated checklists for researchers and readers of case study research.
it has been proposed that barnacle cyprids can maintain position in shoreward- propagating fronts by swimming upward against a downwelling flow, potentially mediating onshore transport of larvae toward intertidal habitat. this study developed a novel flume to characterize swimming behavior of barnacle cyprids in a laboratory downwelling flow. seawater was pumped through a cylindrical observation chamber fitted with diffusers to produce a homogeneous down- welling velocity field. the flume generated plug flow with mean downwelling velocities (indicated by negative sign) of 0 to -47.3 mm s -1 . behavior experiments were done with wild semibalanus bal- anoides cyprids. vertical swimming rates and behaviors were estimated from video observations, and a mixture model was used to estimate velocity distributions for distinct behavioral modes. larvae exhibited multiple behaviors but typically swam upward in response to downwelling, with a maxi- mum estimated vertical velocity of 72.3 mm s -1 . when faced with downwelling flows, cyprids alter- nated between upward swimming and downward swimming to maintain their vertical position in the chamber. as downwelling velocities increased, cyprids that remained in the field of view of the cam- eras exhibited faster mean upward swimming velocities. it is unclear how long individual s. bal- anoides cyprids can maintain depth, but cyprids were able to maintain depth throughout the 2 min observation period. this study supports earlier hypotheses based on field observations by demon- strating that s. balanoides cyprids swim well enough to counter downwelling velocities characteris- tic of convergence zones. swimming against downwelling flow could be an adaptive behavior that enables shoreward transport in the absence of any larval ability to swim toward shore or even to sense its direction.  field observations imply that accumulation and advection of invertebrate larvae and other plankton by propagating fronts provides an efficient mechanism for the cross-shelf transport and subsequent coastal settlement of larvae and plankton. gravity currents propagating into a heavier, uniform-density fluid are known to have near-surface velocities u that exceed the propagation speed c of the gravity current nose. it is shown by simple dam-break laboratory experiments and through corresponding numerical solutions of two-dimensional stratified flow and lagrangian particle advection that this characteristic of gravity currents can lead to accumulation in the gravity current nose of particles that originate well behind the gravity current head. however, efficient particle accumulation and transport with the speed c only occurs for particles with sufficient vertical buoyancy or vertical swimming capability. weakly buoyant or neutral particles are swept down and back away from the gravity current head by the circulation in this region. a dam break into an ambient fluid with stratification (two-layered) could result in the transport of some particles that are initially trapped in the forepart of the leading disturbance, an undular bore. however, this situation does not result in significant accumulation of particles at the leading edge of the disturbance. the numerical solutions show that particles that originate in the dense fluid ahead of the gravity current are much less likely to be accumulated at the gravity current nose. a simple scaling criterion for the minimum vertical buoyancy velocity for efficient accumulation and transport of buoyant particles based on the gravity current and particle characteristics is developed and compares favorably with the numerical results. the implications of these results for transport of larvae in coastal environments are discussed. the dynamics of marine benthic invertebrate populations are greatly affected by larval transport. for near-shore populations, larval transport prior to settlement includes at least three processes: cross-shore advection, because larvae are generally very small and cannot control their cross-shore position by swimming alone; larval behavior, because by swimming vertically, larvae might be able to exploit some depth-dependent cross-shore flows; and accumulation by convergent circulation in propagating features, because cross-shore advection of larvae is often dependent on the retention of larvae at the propagating features. several hypotheses of onshore larval transport, namely surface slicks over linear internal waves (shanks 1983), internal bore warm fronts (pineda 1994), and upwelling relaxation fronts (farrell et al. 1991), invoke concentration of larvae at propagating features. these hypotheses state that larvae become concentrated at convergent features aligned parallel to the coastline and that larval transport occurs as these linear features propagate shoreward. the interplay between transport and accumulation is poorly understood; issues include (1) the dependency of transport on accumulation, and of accumulation on larval behavior, and (2) whether the frontal larvae originate onshore or off
the chemical shifts measured in solution-state and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) are powerful probes of the structure and dynamics of protein molecules. the exploitation of chemical shifts requires methods to correlate these data with the protein structures and sequences. we present here an approach to calculate accurate chemical shifts in both ordered and disordered proteins using exclusively the information contained in their sequences. our sequence-based approach, protein sequences and chemical shift correlations (prosecco), achieves the accuracy of the most advanced structure-based methods in the characterization of chemical shifts of folded proteins and improves the state of the art in the study of disordered proteins. our analyses revealed fundamental insights on the structural information carried by nmr chemical shifts of structured and unstructured protein states.  nmr chemical shifts provide important local structural information for proteins and are key in recently described protein structure generation protocols. we describe a new chemical shift prediction program, sparta+, which is based on artificial neural networking. the neural network is trained on a large carefully pruned database, containing 580 proteins for which high-resolution x-ray structures and nearly complete backbone and 13cβ chemical shifts are available. the neural network is trained to establish quantitative relations between chemical shifts and protein structures, including backbone and side-chain conformation, h-bonding, electric fields and ring-current effects. the trained neural network yields rapid chemical shift prediction for backbone and 13cβ atoms, with standard deviations of 2.45, 1.09, 0.94, 1.14, 0.25 and 0.49 ppm for δ15n, δ13c’, δ13cα, δ13cβ, δ1hα and δ1hn, respectively, between the sparta+ predicted and experimental shifts for a set of eleven validation proteins. these results represent a modest but consistent improvement (2–10%) over the best programs available to date, and appear to be approaching the limit at which empirical approaches can predict chemical shifts.
in a previous study (krishnan, 2016) we identified a whole-brain pattern, the vicarious pain signature (vps), which predicts vicarious pain when participants observe pictures of strangers in pain. here, we test its generalization to observation of pain in a close significant other. participants experienced painful heat (self-pain) and observed their romantic partner in pain (partner-pain). we measured whether (i) the vps would respond selectively to partner-pain and (ii) the neurologic pain signature (nps), a measure validated to track somatic pain, would selectively respond to self-pain, despite the high interpersonal closeness between partners. the partner-pain condition activated the vps (t = 4.71, p = 0.00005), but not the nps (t = -1.03, p = 0.308). the self-pain condition activated the nps (t = 13.70, p < .00005), but not the vps (t = -1.03 p = 0.308). relative vps-nps response differences strongly discriminated partner-pain vs. self-pain (cross-validated accuracy=97%, p < .000001). greater interpersonal closeness between partners predicted greater vps responses during partner-pain (r = 0.388, p = 0.050) and greater unpleasantness when observing the romantic partner in pain (r = 0.559, p = 0.003). the vps generalizes across empathy paradigms and to an interactive social setting, and strongly activates when observing a close significant other in pain. vps responses may be modulated by relevant interpersonal relationship factors. self-pain and partner-pain evoke non-overlapping large-scale neural representations.  the current study investigates whether mere stereotypes are sufficient to modulate empathic responses to other people's (mis)fortunes, how these modulations manifest in the brain, and whether affective and neural responses relate to endorsing harm against different outgroup targets. participants feel least bad when misfortunes befall envied targets and worst when misfortunes befall pitied targets, as compared with ingroup targets. participants are also least willing to endorse harming pitied targets, despite pitied targets being outgroup members. however, those participants who exhibit increased activation in functionally defined insula/middle frontal gyrus when viewing pity targets experience positive events not only report feeling worse about those events but also more willing to harm pity targets in a tradeoff scenario. similarly, increased activation in anatomically defined bilateral anterior insula, in response to positive events, predicts increased willingness to harm envy targets, but decreased willingness to harm ingroup targets, above and beyond self-reported affect in response to the events. stereotypes' specific content and not just outgroup membership modulates empathic responses and related behavioral consequences including harm.
language adaptation (similarly to domain adaptation) is a general approach to extend existing resources from a better resourced language (donor) to a lesser resourced one (recipient) by exploiting the lexical and grammatical similarity between them when the two languages are related. the current study improves the state of the art in cross-lingual word embeddings by considering the impact of orthographic similarity between cognates. in particular, the use of the weighted levenshtein distance combined with orthogonalisation of the translation matrix and generalised correction for hubness can considerably improve the state of the art in induction of bilingual lexicons. in addition to intrinsic evaluation in the bilingual lexicon induction task, the paper reports extrinsic evaluation of the cross-lingual embeddings via their application to the named-entity recognition task across slavonic languages. the tools and the aligned word embedding spaces for the romance and slavonic language families have been released.  the zero-shot paradigm exploits vector-based word representations extracted from text corpora with unsupervised methods to learn general mapping functions from other feature spaces onto word space, where the words associated to the nearest neighbours of the mapped vectors are used as their linguistic labels. we show that the neighbourhoods of the mapped elements are strongly polluted by hubs, vectors that tend to be near a high proportion of items, pushing their correct labels down the neighbour list. after illustrating the problem empirically, we propose a simple method to correct it by taking the proximity distribution of potential neighbours across many mapped vectors into account. we show that this correction leads to consistent improvements in realistic zero-shot experiments in the cross-lingual, image labeling and image retrieval domains.
in this paper, a new integrated weight particle filter (iwpf) algorithm is proposed based on the combination of correlation particle estimation (cpe) weight and sequential importance re-sampling (sir) weight. this method can reduce degeneracy phenomenon and re-sampling times of traditional particle filter. by choosing the typical nonlinear system model, the simulation results show that iwpf performs better than cpe and sir. in our simulation case, this method can provide a 15% increase of accuracy in state estimation and a 30% decrease of re-sampling times.  this article analyses the recently suggested particle approach to filtering time series. we suggest that the algorithm is not robust to outliers for two reasons: the design of the simulators and the use of the discrete support to represent the sequentially updating prior distribution. here we tackle the first of these problems.
objectiveto review the evidence that agents which preferentially affect serotonin (5-ht) attenuate the ability of n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor non-competitive antagonists (nmda-ra), e.g., phencyclidine (pcp), dizocilpine (mk-801), and ketamine, to stimulate locomotor activity (la), and to impair novel object recognition (nor).rationalenmda-ra-induced increased la and impairment of nor are widely used models of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs (apds), and the identification of novel treatments. serotonin (5-ht) plays an important role in attenuating these effects of nmda-ra.resultsselective 5-ht2a inverse agonists, e.g., m100907 and acp-103, and atypical apds, which are more potent 5-ht2a than d2 antagonists, e.g., clozapine and lurasidone, are more effective than selective d2 receptor antagonists to attenuate nmda-ra-induced increased la. 5-ht2a inverse agonists alone are not effective to improve nmda-ra-impaired nor, but augment the effects of atypical, but not typical apds, to improve nor. the 5-ht1a receptor partial agonist tandospirone alone and the 5-ht1a agonist effects of atypical apds may substitute for, or contribute to, the effects of d2 and 5-ht2a receptor antagonism to reverse the nmda-ra impairment in nor. 5-ht6 and 5-ht7 receptor antagonists may also attenuate these nmda-ra-induced behaviors. 5-ht2c receptor inverse agonist, but not neutral antagonists, block nor in naïve rats and the effects of atypical apds to restore nor in pcp-treated rats, suggesting the importance of the constitutive activity of 5-ht2c receptors in nor.conclusionsmultiple 5-ht receptors contribute to effective treatments to reverse adverse effects of nmda-ra which model psychosis and cognitive impairment.  rationale5-ht receptor mechanisms have been suggested to mediate improvements in cognition in schizophrenia.aimthe aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of 5-ht receptor mechanisms in sub-chronic phencyclidine (pcp)-induced reversal learning deficits in female rats, a task of relevance to schizophrenia.methodsadult female hooded lister rats were trained to perform an operant reversal learning task and then received sub-chronic pcp (2 mg/kg) or vehicle intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice daily for 7 days, followed by 7-day washout. rats then received an acute dose of the 5-ht7 receptor antagonist sb-269970a (1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle. in experiment 2, pcp-treated rats received the selective 5-ht2c receptor antagonist, sb-243213a acutely (1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle. in experiment 3, pcp-treated rats received the 5-ht1a receptor partial agonist, buspirone (0.15625, 0.3125, and 0.625 mg/kg, i.p.) in combination with the selective 5-ht1a receptor antagonist way-100635 (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg).resultsin all experiments, sub-chronic pcp significantly impaired reversal phase performance (p < 0.01–0.001), with no effect in the initial phase. sb-269970a at 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg significantly improved the pcp-induced deficit (p < 0.05). sb-243213a also significantly attenuated the deficit at 10 mg/kg (p < 0.05). in experiment 3, buspirone attenuated the deficit with significant effects at 0.3125 and 0.625 mg/kg (p < 0.05). way-100635 at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg produced a partial attenuation of buspirone’s effect as buspirone (0.3125 mg/kg) in the presence of way-100635 did not significantly reverse the pcp-induced deficit.conclusionsthese studies implicate the role of 5-ht7, 5-ht2c, and 5-ht1a receptors in the improvement of cognitive dysfunction of relevance to schizophrenia.
the c-jun nh2-terminal kinase (jnk), also known as stress-activated protein kinase, is a mitogen-activated protein kinase that determines cell survival in response to environmental stress. activation of jnk involves redox-sensitive mechanisms and physiological stimuli such as shear stress, the dragging force generated by blood flow over the endothelium. laminar shear stress has antiatherogenic properties and controls structure and function of endothelial cells by mechanisms including production of nitric oxide (no) and superoxide ([formula: see text]). here we show that both no and [formula: see text] are required for activation of jnk by shear stress in endothelial cells. the present study also demonstrates that exposure of endothelial cells to shear stress increases tyrosine nitration, a marker of reactive nitrogen species formation. furthermore, inhibitors or scavengers of no, [formula: see text], or reactive nitrogen species prevented shear-dependent increase in tyrosine nitration and activation of jnk. peroxynitrite alone, added to cells as a bolus or generated over 60 min by 3-morpholinosydnonimine, also activates jnk. these results suggest that reactive nitrogen species, in this case most likely peroxynitrite, act as signaling molecules in the mechanoactivation of jnk.  shear stress differentially regulates production of many vasoactive factors at the level of gene expression in endothelial cells that may be mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) and n-terminal jun kinase (jnk). here we show, using bovine aortic endothelial cells (baec), that shear stress differentially regulates erk and jnk by mechanisms involving gi2 and pertussis toxin (ptx)-insensitive g-protein-dependent pathways, respectively. shear activated erk with a rapid, biphasic time course (maximum by 5 min and basal by 30-min shear exposure) and force dependence (minimum and maximum at 1 and 10 dyn/cm2 shear stress, respectively). ptx treatment prevented shear-dependent activation of erk1/2, consistent with a gi-dependent mechanism. in contrast, jnk activity was maximally turned on by a threshold level of shear force (0.5 dyn/cm2 or higher) with a much slower and prolonged time course (requiring at least 30 min to 4 h) than that of erk. also, ptx had no effect on shear-dependent activation of jnk. to further define the shear-sensitive erk and jnk pathways, vectors expressing hemagglutinin epitope-tagged erk (ha-erk) or ha-jnk were co-transfected with other vectors by using adenovirus-polylysine in baec. expression of the mutant αi2(g203), antisense gαi2 and a dominant negative ras (n17ras) prevented shear-dependent activation of ha-erk, while that of αi2(g204) and antisense αi3 did not. expression of a gβ/γ scavenger, the carboxyl terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βark-ct), and n17ras inhibited shear-dependent activation of ha-jnk. treatment of baec with genistein prevented shear-dependent activation of erk and jnk, indicating the essential role of tyrosine kinase(s) in both erk and jnk pathways. these results provide evidence that 1) gi2-protein, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s) are upstream regulators of shear-dependent activation of erk and 2) that shear-dependent activation of jnk is regulated by mechanisms involving gβ/γ, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s).
visual cortical areas are interconnected via layer-specific feedforward and feedback projections. such intricate connections are thought to be essential for parsing complex visual images, but the synergy among different layers in different cortical areas remains unclear. by simultaneously mapping neuronal activities across cortical depths in v1 and v2 of behaving monkeys, we identified spatiotemporally dissociable processes for grouping contour fragments and segregating background components. these processes generated and amplified contour signals within specific layers in v1 and v2. contour-related inter-areal interactions, measured as granger causality, were also dominant between these cortical layers within a time window when the contour signals were rapidly augmented. the grouping process became much faster for isolated contour elements compared with visual contours embedded in a complex background. our results delineate the mode whereby image components are grouped and segmented through synergistic inter-laminar and inter-areal processes that are dynamically adjusted during interpretation of sensory inputs.  the traditional view on visual processing emphasizes a hierarchy: local line segments are first linked into global contours, which in turn are assembled into more complex forms. distinct from this bottom-up viewpoint, here we provide evidence for a theoretical framework whereby objects and their parts are processed almost concurrently in a bidirectional cortico-cortical loop. by simultaneous recordings from v1 and v4 in awake monkeys, we found that information about global contours in a cluttered background emerged initially in v4, started ∼40 ms later in v1, and continued to develop in parallel in both areas. detailed analysis of neuronal response properties implicated contour integration to emerge from both bottom-up and reentrant processes. our results point to an incremental integration mechanism: feedforward assembling accompanied by feedback disambiguating to define and enhance the global contours and to suppress background noise. the consequence is a parallel accumulation of contour information over multiple cortical areas.
an infrasonic observatory collocated with the colorado state university chill radar during the summer of 1995 permitted unique comparisons between severe storm kinematics and detected acoustic energy at subaudible frequencies near 1 hz. radar observations of a velocity couplet aloft (evolving into a tornado) showed a circulation maximum descending for about 30 min while moving to the east. the detected infrasound followed the trend of these observations. a model of sound radiated from vortex systems predicts frequencies in the range observed. these data are interpreted in the context of past infrasonic observations. an ongoing study comparing regional tornado and funnel sightings with archived infrasonic data has identified over 100 cases to date where the infrasonic signals occurred at the time of, and from the direction of, the vortices. for some of these cases, the distances were greater than 100 km. the author and his associates continue to collect datasets to permit further evaluation of infrasonic detection methods.  abstract this paper attempts to explain the “whining” or “hissing” sound reported from tornadoes. the leading hypothesis is that the air masses involved in the tornado circulation execute some free vibrations. it is found that these vibrations may be in the audible range for a small vortex whose radius is of the order of 10 m. or less. a formula is obtained which relates the frequency of the tone to the inner radius of the vortex. this formula is amenable to experimental verification.
background a key epidemiologic feature of schistosomiasis is its focal distribution, which has important implications for the spatial targeting of preventive chemotherapy programs. we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a urine pooling strategy using a point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (poc-cca) cassette test for detection of schistosoma mansoni, and employed simulation modeling to test the classification accuracy and efficiency of this strategy in determining where preventive chemotherapy is needed in low-endemicity settings. methodology we performed a cross-sectional study involving 114 children aged 6–15 years in six neighborhoods in azaguié ahoua, south côte d’ivoire to characterize the sensitivity and specificity of the poc-cca cassette test with urine samples that were tested individually and in pools of 4, 8, and 12. we used a bayesian latent class model to estimate test characteristics for individual poc-cca and quadruplicate kato-katz thick smears on stool samples. we then developed a microsimulation model and used lot quality assurance sampling to test the performance, number of tests, and total cost per school for each pooled testing strategy to predict the binary need for school-based preventive chemotherapy using a 10% prevalence threshold for treatment. principal findings the sensitivity of the urine pooling strategy for s. mansoni diagnosis using pool sizes of 4, 8, and 12 was 85.9%, 79.5%, and 65.4%, respectively, when poc-cca trace results were considered positive, and 61.5%, 47.4%, and 30.8% when poc-cca trace results were considered negative. the modeled specificity ranged from 94.0–97.7% for the urine pooling strategies (when poc-cca trace results were considered negative). the urine pooling strategy, regardless of the pool size, gave comparable and often superior classification performance to stool microscopy for the same number of tests. the urine pooling strategy with a pool size of 4 reduced the number of tests and total cost compared to classical stool microscopy. conclusions/significance this study introduces a method for rapid and efficient s. mansoni prevalence estimation through examining pooled urine samples with poc-cca as an alternative to widely used stool microscopy.  financial resources tend to be limited in schistosomiasis endemic areas, forcing program managers to balance financial and scientific considerations when selecting detection assays. therefore, we compared the costs of using single stool kato-katz, triplicate stool kato-katz, and point-of-contact circulating cathodic antigen (poc-cca) assays for the detection of schistosoma mansoni infection. economic and financial costs were estimated from the viewpoint of a schistosomiasis control program using the ingredients approach. costs related to specimen collection, sample processing and analysis, and treatment delivery were considered. analysis inputs and assumptions were tested using one-way and two-way sensitivity analysis. the total per-person cost of performing the single kato-katz, triplicate kato-katz, and poc-cca was us$6.89, us$17.54, and us$7.26, respectively. major cost drivers included labor, transportation, and supplies. in addition, we provide a costing tool to guide program managers in evaluating detection costs in specific settings, as costs may vary temporally and spatially.
this paper reports our approaches and efforts for developing communication robots for elementary schools. in particular, we describe the fundamental mechanism of the interactive humanoid robot, robovie, for interacting with multiple persons, maintaining relationships, and estimating social relationships among children. the developed robot robovie was applied for two field experiments at elementary schools. the first experiment purpose using it as a peer tutor of foreign language education, and the second was purposed for establishing longitudinal relationships with children. we believe that these results demonstrate a positive perspective for the future possibility of realizing a communication robot that works in elementary schools.  robots increasingly have the potential to interact with people in daily life. it is believed that, based on this ability, they will play an essential role in human society in the not-so-distant future. this article examined the proposition that robots could form relationships with children and that children might learn from robots as they learn from other children. in this article, this idea is studied in an 18-day field trial held at a japanese elementary school. two english-speaking "robovie" robots interacted with first- and sixth-grade pupils at the perimeter of their respective classrooms. using wireless identification tags and sensors, these robots identified and interacted with children who came near them. the robots gestured and spoke english with the children, using a vocabulary of about 300 sentences for speaking and 50 words for recognition. the children were given a brief picture-word matching english test at the start of the trial, after 1 week and after 2 weeks. interactions were counted using the tags, and video and audio were recorded. in the majority of cases, a child's friends were present during the interactions. interaction with the robot was frequent in the 1st week, and then it fell off sharply by the 2nd week. nonetheless, some children continued to interact with the robot. interaction time during the 2nd week predicted improvements in english skill at the posttest, controlling for pretest scores. further analyses indicate that the robots may have been more successful in establishing common ground and influence when the children already had some initial proficiency or interest in english. these results suggest that interactive robots should be designed to have something in common with their users, providing a social as well as technical challenge.
the glycosylation of cell surface proteins plays a crucial role in a multitude of biological processes, such as cell adhesion and recognition. to understand the process of protein glycosylation, the reaction mechanisms of the participating enzymes need to be known. however, the reaction mechanism of retaining glycosyltransferases has not yet been sufficiently explained. here we investigated the catalytic mechanism of human isoform 2 of the retaining glycosyltransferase polypeptide udp-galnac transferase by coupling two different qm/mm-based approaches, namely a potential energy surface scan in two distance difference dimensions and a minimum energy reaction path optimisation using the nudged elastic band method. potential energy scan studies often suffer from inadequate sampling of reactive processes due to a predefined scan coordinate system. at the same time, path optimisation methods enable the sampling of a virtually unlimited number of dimensions, but their results cannot be unambiguously interpreted without knowledge of the potential energy surface. by combining these methods, we have been able to eliminate the most significant sources of potential errors inherent to each of these approaches. the structural model is based on the crystal structure of human isoform 2. in the qm/mm method, the qm region consists of 275 atoms, the remaining 5776 atoms were in the mm region. we found that ppgalnact2 catalyzes a same-face nucleophilic substitution with internal return (sni). the optimized transition state for the reaction is 13.8 kcal/mol higher in energy than the reactant while the energy of the product complex is 6.7 kcal/mol lower. during the process of nucleophilic attack, a proton is synchronously transferred to the leaving phosphate. the presence of a short-lived metastable oxocarbenium intermediate is likely, as indicated by the reaction energy profiles obtained using high-level density functionals.  we present the theoretical and technical foundations of the amsterdam density functional (adf) program with a survey of the characteristics of the code (numerical integration, density fitting for the coulomb potential, and sto basis functions). recent developments enhance the efficiency of adf (e.g., parallelization, near order‐n scaling, qm/mm) and its functionality (e.g., nmr chemical shifts, cosmo solvent effects, zora relativistic method, excitation energies, frequency‐dependent (hyper)polarizabilities, atomic vdd charges). in the applications section we discuss the physical model of the electronic structure and the chemical bond, i.e., the kohn–sham molecular orbital (mo) theory, and illustrate the power of the kohn–sham mo model in conjunction with the adf‐typical fragment approach to quantitatively understand and predict chemical phenomena. we review the “activation‐strain ts interaction” (ats) model of chemical reactivity as a conceptual framework for understanding how activation barriers of various types of (competing) reaction mechanisms arise and how they may be controlled, for example, in organic chemistry or homogeneous catalysis. finally, we include a brief discussion of exemplary applications in the field of biochemistry (structure and bonding of dna) and of time‐dependent density functional theory (tddft) to indicate how this development further reinforces the adf tools for the analysis of chemical phenomena. © 2001 john wiley & sons, inc. j comput chem 22: 931–967, 2001
objective to study the relationship and changes of cervical mri, tcd and baep in patients with "isolated" vertigo.   methods the relationship and changes of cervical mri, tcd and baep were investigated respectively in 125 patients with "isolated" vertigo and 100 healthy controls.   results there were statistically significant differences between two groups for overall abnormalities of tcd (x(2) = 61.96, p<0.01), baep (x(2) = 97.99, p<0.01), and cervical mri severity scale (z = -8.71, p<0.01). in vertigo group, results showed significant correlations between tcd and cervical mri, tcd and baep as well. and analysis on tcd pi and some items of baep demonstrated positive linear correlations. there were no statistical differences or correlations in control group.   conclusions tcd is a sensitive method of "isolated" vertigo screening. a combined test protocol of cervical mri, tcd and baep has superiorities to assess "isolated" vertigo.  abstract objectives: vertigo can be a manifestation of underlying vertebrobasilar stroke in older adults. the study objectives were to investigate the correlation, sensitivity, and specificity of the auditory brainstem response (abr), electronystagmorgraphy (eng), and transcranial doppler (tcd) collectively to distinguish between vertigo due to vertebrobasilar insufficiency (vbi) and vertigo due to non-vbi. design: prospective experimental study comparing eng, abr, and tcd battery findings between two groups of patients with vertigo and a control group. study sample: participants included 14 patients with vertigo of vbi origin, 14 patients with vertigo of non-vbi, and 11 matched controls. results: participants with vbi had more abnormal findings in the eng (86%), tcd (72%), and abr (64%) compared to the non-vbi group (64%, 21%, and 7%, respectively) and the control group. the combined battery revealed positive correlations, 64% sensitivity, and 84% positive predictive value (ppv) in the vbi group, and 100% specificity with lack of correlations in the non-vbi group. conclusions: the modest sensitivity and ppv helps with early detection of vbi, thus preventing risk of vertebrobasilar stroke in 84% to 64% of patients. the 100% specificity in the non-vbi group rules out vbi, thus reducing the referral rate for unnecessary, diagnostic evaluations and ineffective treatment.
diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease, which has an increasing trend all over the world. type 2 diabetes constitutes 90% of all diabetes. it is associated with weight gain and insulin resistance. research during recent years has suggested that shift work could be a risk factor of type 2 diabetes. since shift work is becoming more common, it could contribute to the increasing trend of diabetes. in this systematic review, we have studied the potential association between shift work and type 2 diabetes. we have also reviewed studies on control of diabetes in relation to shift work.  objective: this study investigated the effect of alternating shift work (asw) on the onset of diabetes mellitus in japanese workers compared with onset in day-shift work (dsw). methods: a longitudinal study was carried out on a dsw group (n = 3203) and asw group (n = 2426) of a steel company who received their annual health checkups over a 10-year period between 1991 and 2001. the association between job schedule type and onset of diabetes mellitus (glycated hemoglobin a1c ≥6.0% or medication) was investigated by multivariate pooled logistic regression analyses. results: the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the development of diabetes mellitus in the asw group compared with the dsw group was 1.35 (1.05–1.75). conclusions: our study revealed that the asw is an independent risk factor for the onset of diabetes mellitus.
purposefrom a cancer survivor perspective, the purpose of this paper is to explore what has changed in their lives that they attribute to the disease. the rationale for the study is that evidence of the extent to which cancer disrupts people’s lives in the longer term is contradictory.methodswritten accounts from 40 cancer survivors were analysed using interpretative methods. the researchers drew on the concept of biographical disruption as a framework for analysis.resultscancer survivors construct cancer as a biographically disruptive event with ongoing physical and psychosocial impacts. cancer is constructed as a permanent threat to life which is responsible for increasing their awareness of their own mortality and invoking positive changes to self. these formulations of living with cancer were found across a range of participants, including those who defined themselves as currently free of cancer, those who had recurrence, those who had been diagnosed 5 years ago and those who had been free of cancer for a long time.conclusionsthis study adds to the body of literature exploring how to enhance supportive care for cancer survivors by reflecting on biographical disruption and continuity, and the complexities within individual constructions of changes in life that they attribute to cancer. cancer survivors should be given opportunities to articulate the impact of cancer, thus giving legitimate space to talk about cancer’s ongoing resonance on life so that problems and difficulties are not dismissed or trivialised.  there has been substantial empirical research on the health benefits of expressive writing. however, there has been less psychological research on the broader nature of writing and its relationship with health. the aim of this special section is to promote a more extensive engagement between health psychology and writing. it includes three articles on the value of investigating more established forms of writing, the nature of creative writing and the value of an intensive analysis of written accounts of illness. this article introduces this special section.
policy on child and adolescent mental health services (camhs) in england has undergone radical changes in the last 15 years, with far reaching implications for funding models, access to services and service delivery. using corpus analysis and critical discourse analysis, we explore how childhood, mental health and camhs are constituted in 15 policy documents, 9 pre-2010 and 6 post-2010. we trace how these constructions have changed over time and consider the practice implications of these changes. we identify how children’s distress is individualised, through medicalising discourses and shifting understandings of the relationship between socio-economic context and mental health. this is evidenced in a shift from seeing children’s mental health challenges as produced by social and economic inequities to a view that children’s mental health must be addressed early to prevent future socio-economic burden. we consider the implications of camhs policies for the relationship between children, families, mental health services and the state. the article concludes by exploring how concepts of ‘parity of esteem’ and ‘stigma reduction’ may inadvertently exacerbate the individualisation of children’s mental health.  ▪ abstract this paper provides a survey of critical discourse analysis (cda), a recent school of discourse analysis that concerns itself with relations of power and inequality in language. cda explicitly intends to incorporate social-theoretical insights into discourse analysis and advocates social commitment and interventionism in research. the main programmatic features and domains of enquiry of cda are discussed, with emphasis on attempts toward theory formation by one of cda's most prominent scholars, norman fairclough. another section reviews the genesis and disciplinary growth of cda, mentions some of the recent critical reactions to it, and situates it within the wider picture of a new critical paradigm developing in a number of language-oriented (sub) disciplines. in this critical paradigm, topics such as ideology, inequality, and power figure prominently, and many scholars productively attempt to incorporate social-theoretical insights into the study of language.
fusarium verticillioides produces the mycotoxin fumonisin b(1) (fb(1)) on maize kernels. in this study, we identified a putative protein phosphatase gene cpp1 in f. verticillioides, and investigated its role in fb(1) regulation. previous work has shown that cpp1 expression is elevated in an fb(1)-suppressing genetic background. thus, we hypothesized that cpp1 is negatively associated with fb(1) production. to test this hypothesis, we generated a cpp1 knockout mutant, pp179, and studied the effects of gene deletion on fb(1) biosynthesis and fungal development. pp179 showed elevated expression of fum genes, and in turn produced higher levels of fb(1) than the wild-type progenitor. other significant mutant phenotypes included reduced radial growth on agar plates, reduced conidia germination rates, significantly increased macroconidia formation, and hyphal swelling. to verify that these phenotypes were directly due to cpp1 deletion, we complemented pp179 with the wild-type cpp1 gene. the complemented strain ppc4 showed fum1 expression and fb(1) production similar to that of the wild-type, providing evidence that cpp1 is negatively associated with fb(1) biosynthesis. other pp179 phenotypes, such as macroconidiation and hyphal swelling, were also restored to that of wild-type progenitor. furthermore, we complemented f. verticillioides pp179 strain with neurospora crassa wild-type ppe-1 gene, demonstrating that cpp1 and ppe-1 proteins are functionally conserved. pleiotropic effects of cpp1 deletion led us to hypothesize that cpp1 is associated with multiple downstream signalling pathways in f. verticillioides. identification and functional characterization of downstream cpp1-interacting proteins are necessary to better understand the complex regulatory mechanisms associated with cpp1.  yeast cells can select bud sites in either of two distinct spatial patterns. a cells and alpha cells typically bud in an axial pattern, in which both mother and daughter cells form new buds adjacent to the preceding division site. in contrast, a/alpha cells typically bud in a bipolar pattern, in which new buds can form at either pole of the cell. the bud3 gene is specifically required for the axial pattern of budding: mutations of bud3 (including a deletion) affect the axial pattern but not the bipolar pattern. the sequence of bud3 predicts a product (bud3p) of 1635 amino acids with no strong or instructive similarities to previously known proteins. however, immunofluorescence localization of bud3p has revealed that it assembles in an apparent double ring encircling the mother-bud neck shortly after the mitotic spindle forms. the bud3p structure at the neck persists until cytokinesis, when it splits to yield a single ring of bud3p marking the division site on each of the two progeny cells. these single rings remain for much of the ensuing unbudded phase and then disassemble. the bud3p rings are indistinguishable from those of the neck filament- associated proteins (cdc3p, cdc10p, cdc11p, and cdc12p), except that the latter proteins assemble before bud emergence and remain in place for the duration of the cell cycle. upon shift of a temperature- sensitive cdc12 mutant to restrictive temperature, localization of both bud3p and the neck filament-associated proteins is rapidly lost. in addition, a haploid cdc11 mutant loses its axial-budding pattern upon shift to restrictive temperature. taken together, the data suggest that bud3p and the neck filaments are linked in a cycle in which each controls the position of the other's assembly: bud3p assembles onto the neck filaments in one cell cycle to mark the site for axial budding (including assembly of the new ring of neck filaments) in the next cell cycle. as the expression and localization of bud3p are similar in a, alpha, and a/alpha cells, additional regulation must exist such that bud3p restricts the position of bud formation in a and alpha cells but not in a/alpha cells.
backgroundhealth consumers have moved away from a reliance on medical practitioner advice to more independent decision processes and so their information search processes have subsequently widened. this study examined how persons with back pain searched for alternative treatment types and service providers. that is, what information do they seek and how; what sources do they use and why; and by what means do they search for it?methods12 persons with back pain were interviewed. the method used was convergent interviewing. this involved a series of semi-structured questions to obtain open-ended answers. the interviewer analysed the responses and refined the questions after each interview, to converge on the dominant factors influencing decisions about treatment patterns.resultspersons with back pain mainly search their memories and use word of mouth (their doctor and friends) for information about potential treatments and service providers. their search is generally limited due to personal, provider-related and information-supply reasons. however, they did want in-depth information about the alternative treatments and providers in an attempt to establish apriori their efficacy in treating their specific back problems. they searched different sources depending on the type of information they required.conclusionsthe findings differ from previous studies about the types of information health consumers require when searching for information about alternative or mainstream healthcare services. the results have identified for the first time that limited information availability was only one of three categories of reasons identified about why persons with back pain do not search for more information particularly from external non-personal sources.  this research used the somewhat new methodology of convergent interviews to develop a conceptual framework about relationship constructs in an internet environment. more generally, this article describes and illustrates the processes and the strengths of convergent interviewing to investigate under‐researched areas, and compares it with alternative qualitative techniques like in‐depth interviews, case research and focus groups. the illustration involves interviews conducted with marketing managers and business consultants from ten service companies, about internet and relationship marketing. it is argued that convergent interviewing is more appropriate than some other qualitative methods to investigate under‐researched areas where there are few experts because it provides a way of quickly converging on key issues in the area, an efficient mechanism for data analysis after each interview, and a way of deciding when to stop collecting data. convergent interviews could become another useful qualitative research method to explore new issues about emerging marketing phenomena.
abstract cavitation is a key pathological feature of human tuberculosis (tb), and is a well-recognized risk factor for transmission of infection, relapse after treatment and the emergence of drug resistance. despite intense interest in the mechanisms underlying cavitation and its negative impact on treatment outcomes, there has been limited study of this phenomenon, owing in large part to the limitations of existing animal models. although cavitation does not occur in conventional mouse strains after infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis, cavitary lung lesions have occasionally been observed in c3heb/fej mice. however, to date, there has been no demonstration that cavitation can be produced consistently enough to support c3heb/fej mice as a new and useful model of cavitary tb. we utilized serial computed tomography (ct) imaging to detect pulmonary cavitation in c3heb/fej mice after aerosol infection with m. tuberculosis. post-mortem analyses were performed to characterize lung lesions and to localize matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) previously implicated in cavitary tb in situ. a total of 47-61% of infected mice developed cavities during primary disease or relapse after non-curative treatments. key pathological features of human tb, including simultaneous presence of multiple pathologies, were noted in lung tissues. optical imaging demonstrated increased mmp activity in tb lesions and mmp-9 was significantly expressed in cavitary lesions. tissue mmp-9 activity could be abrogated by specific inhibitors. in situ, three-dimensional analyses of cavitary lesions demonstrated that 22.06% of cd11b+ signal colocalized with mmp-9. c3heb/fej mice represent a reliable, economical and tractable model of cavitary tb, with key similarities to human tb. this model should provide an excellent tool to better understand the pathogenesis of cavitation and its effects on tb treatments. summary: we demonstrate for the first time a murine model that consistently produces pulmonary cavitary tb and provides a tractable and economical new tool for better understanding of cavitation.  active tuberculosis (tb) often presents with advanced pulmonary disease, including irreversible lung damage and cavities. cavitary pathology contributes to antibiotic failure, transmission, morbidity and mortality. matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), in particular mmp‐1, are implicated in tb pathogenesis. we explored the mechanisms relating mmp/timp imbalance to cavity formation in a modified rabbit model of cavitary tb. our model resulted in consistent progression of consolidation to human‐like cavities (100% by day 28), with resultant bacillary burdens (>107 cfu/g) far greater than those found in matched granulomatous tissue (105 cfu/g). using a novel, breath‐hold computed tomography (ct) scanning and image analysis protocol, we showed that cavities developed rapidly from areas of densely consolidated tissue. radiological change correlated with a decrease in functional lung tissue, as estimated by changes in lung density during controlled pulmonary expansion (r2 = 0.6356, p < 0.0001). we demonstrated that the expression of interstitial collagenase (mmp‐1) was specifically greater in cavitary compared to granulomatous lesions (p < 0.01), and that timp‐3 significantly decreased at the cavity surface. our findings demonstrated that an mmp‐1/timp imbalance is associated with the progression of consolidated regions to cavities containing very high bacterial burdens. our model provided mechanistic insight, correlating with human disease at the pathological, microbiological and molecular levels. it also provided a strategy to investigate therapeutics in the context of complex tb pathology. we used these findings to predict a mmp/timp balance in active tb and confirmed this in human plasma, revealing the potential of mmp/timp levels as key components of a diagnostic matrix aimed at distinguishing active from latent tb (ppv = 92.9%, 95% ci 66.1–99.8%, npv = 85.6%; 95% ci 77.0–91.9%). copyright © 2014 pathological society of great britain and ireland. published by john wiley & sons, ltd
background:community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is the most common infectious cause of death in the united states. to understand the effect of efforts to improve quality and efficiency of care in cap, we examined the trends in mortality and costs among hospitalized cap patients. methods:using the national inpatient sample between 1993 and 2005, we studied 569,524 cap admissions. the primary outcome was mortality at discharge. we used logistic regression to evaluate the mortality trend, adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities. to account for the effect of early discharge practices, we also compared daily mortality rates and performed a cox proportional hazards model. we used a generalized linear model to analyze trends in hospitalization costs, which were derived using cost-to-charge ratios. results:over time, length of stay declined, while more patients were discharged to other facilities. the frequency of many comorbidities increased. age/gender-adjusted mortality decreased from 8.9% to 4.1% (p < 0.001). in multivariable analysis, the mortality risk declined through 2005 (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.53), compared with the reference year 1993. the daily mortality rates demonstrated that most of the mortality reduction occurred early during hospitalization. after adjusting for early discharge practices, the risk of mortality still declined through 2005 (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.78). median hospitalization costs exhibited a moderate reduction over time, mostly because of reduced length of stay. conclusions:mortality among patients hospitalized for cap has declined. lower in-hospital mortality at a reduced cost suggests that pneumonia is a case of improved productivity in health care.  purpose to assess the variation in length of stay for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia and to determine whether patients who are treated in hospitals with shorter mean stays have worse medical outcomes.   subjects and methods we prospectively studied a cohort of 1,188 adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia who had been admitted to one community and three university teaching hospitals. we compared patients' mean length of stay, mortality, hospital readmission, return to usual activities, return to work, and pneumonia-related symptoms among the four study hospitals. all outcomes were adjusted for baseline differences in severity of illness and comorbidity.   results adjusted interhospital differences in mean length of stay ranged from 0.9 to 2.3 days (p <0.001). when the risk of each medical outcome was compared between patients admitted to the hospital with the shortest length of stay and those admitted to longer stay hospitals, there were no differences in mortality [relative risk (rr) = 0.7; 95% ci, 0.3 to 1.7], hospital readmission (rr = 0.8; 95% ci, 0.5 to 1.2), return to usual activities (rr = 1.1; 95% ci, 0.9 to 1.3), or return to work (rr = 1.2; 95% ci, 0.8 to 2.0) during the first 14 days after discharge, or in the mean number of pneumonia-related symptoms 30 days after admission (p = 0.54).   conclusions we observed substantial interhospital variation in the lengths of stay for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. the finding that medical outcomes were similar in patients admitted to the hospital with the shortest length of stay and those admitted to hospitals with longer mean lengths of stay suggests that hospitals with longer stays may be able to reduce the mean duration of hospitalization for this disease without adversely affecting patient outcomes.
hospital length of stay (los) after liver transplantation has been determined to correlate with liver disease severity, post‐transplant survival rates, and transplant‐associated costs. a patient's model for end‐stage liver disease (meld) score and an organ's donor risk index (dri) have both been found to be significant predictors of los, but these two factors alone are insufficient to form an accurate prediction. previous studies have identified other factors predictive of los, which can be incorporated with meld and dri to create more specific results. the objective of this study was to create an algorithm, or models, based on the most significant los predictors as identified from national data at different stages of the transplant process. four models were developed predicting los using recipient factors, payment factors, donor factors, and postoperative factors. a medical care team member can enter a patient's data into the model and receive a reasonably accurate prediction of los for each phase of the liver transplant process, specifying the impact of each factor. these predictions would help predict the factors most likely to prolong los, inform resource allocation, and provide patients with more specific predictions of their los following transplantation.  the effect of obesity on outcomes following liver transplantation remains unclear. we reviewed our experience with 302 liver transplants in 277 patients from september 1989 to september 1996 to determine the effect of body mass on outcome. two hundred and seventeen transplants were performed in patients with a body mass index (bmi)<30 kg/m2, 55 in patients with a bmi of 30–34 kg/m2 (obese), and 30 in patients with a bmi>35 kg/m2 (severely obese). non‐weight related pre‐operative demographics were similar between groups with the exception of an increased frequency of cryptogenic cirrhosis among the obese and severely obese patients. intra‐operative transfusion requirements were greater for the severely obese group (16.2±3.5 units versus 9.1±0.8 units for the non‐obese, p=0.0004), though not when normalized to body weight (0.14±0.03 units/kg versus 0.13±0.01 units/kg, p>0.05). post‐operatively, severely obese patients had a higher rate of wound infection (20 versus 4%, p=0.0001) and death attributed to multisystem organ failure (15 versus 2%, p=0.0001), although overall mortality prior to discharge and total complications were not different between groups. actual 1‐yr graft survival showed a negative trend in the severely obese group (67 versus 81% for non‐obese, p=0.07), but both 3‐yr graft survival and patient survival were similar to non‐obese patients (p=0.12 and 0.17, respectively by the cox–mantel test). liver transplantation in severely obese patients is associated with wound infection and early death from multisystem organ failure, but has similar long‐term outcomes when compared to non‐obese controls.
we observe that the function introduced by z. tu and y. deng in the eprint archive paper 2009/272 is weak against fast algebraic attacks. we propose an alternative function sharing all the properties of the tu-deng function but having not this weakness.  after the improvement by courtois and meier of the algebraic attacks on stream ciphers and the introduction of the related notion of algebraic immunity, several constructions of infinite classes of boolean functions with optimum algebraic immunity have been proposed. all of them gave functions whose algebraic degrees are high enough for resisting the berlekamp-massey attack and the recent ronjom-helleseth attack, but whose nonlinearities either achieve the worst possible value (given by lobanov's bound) or are slightly superior to it. hence, these functions do not allow resistance to fast correlation attacks. moreover, they do not behave well with respect to fast algebraic attacks. in this paper, we study an infinite class of functions which achieve an optimum algebraic immunity. we prove that they have an optimum algebraic degree and a much better nonlinearity than all the previously obtained infinite classes of functions. we check that, at least for small values of the number of variables, the functions of this class have in fact a very good nonlinearity and also a good behavior against fast algebraic attacks.
active travel to school has been referred to as one way of increasing the level of daily physical exercise, but the actual impacts on student’s general health are not clear. recently, a possible association between active travel to school and the duration of sleep was suggested. thus, the aim was of this study to investigate the associations between the type of transportation and travel time to school, the time in bed and sleepiness in the classroom of high school students. information on sleeping habits and travel to school of 1126 high school students were analyzed, where 55.1% were girls with an average age of 16.24 (1.39) years old, in santa maria municipality, rio grande do sul, brazil. multiple linear regression and adjusted prevalence rates analyses were carried out. the frequency of active travel found was 61.8%. associations between time in bed, sleepiness in the classroom and the type of transportation (active or passive) were not identified. nevertheless, the time in bed was inversely associated with the travel time (p = 0.036) and with a phase delay. in the adjusted analysis, active travel was more incident for the students of schools in the suburbs (pr: 1.68; ci: 1.40–2.01) in comparison with the students of schools in the center. therefore, longer trips were associated with a reduction of sleep duration of morning and night groups. interventions concerning active travel to school must be carried out cautiously in order not to cause a reduction of the sleeping time.  introduction driven largely by international declines in rates of walking and bicycling to school and the noted health benefits of physical activity for children, research on children's active commuting to school has expanded rapidly during the past 5 years. we summarize research on predictors and health consequences of active commuting to school and outline and evaluate programs specific to children's walking and bicycling to school. methods literature on children's active commuting to school published before june 2007 was compiled by searching pubmed, psycinfo, and the national transportation library databases; conducting internet searches on program-based activities; and reviewing relevant transportation journals published during the last 4 years. results children who walk or bicycle to school have higher daily levels of physical activity and better cardiovascular fitness than do children who do not actively commute to school. a wide range of predictors of children's active commuting behaviors was identified, including demographic factors, individual and family factors, school factors (including the immediate area surrounding schools), and social and physical environmental factors. safe routes to school and the walking school bus are 2 public health efforts that promote walking and bicycling to school. although evaluations of these programs are limited, evidence exists that these activities are viewed positively by key stakeholders and have positive effects on children's active commuting to school. conclusion future efforts to promote walking and bicycling to school will be facilitated by building on current research, combining the strengths of scientific rigor with the predesign and postdesign provided by intervention activities, and disseminating results broadly and rapidly.
hydroxyproline (hyp) metabolism is a key source of glyoxylate production in the body and may be a major contributor to excessive oxalate production in the primary hyperoxalurias where glyoxylate metabolism is impaired. important gaps in our knowledge include identification of the tissues with the capacity to degrade hyp and the development of model systems to study this metabolism and how to suppress it. the expression of mrna for enzymes in the pathway was examined in 15 different human tissues. expression of the complete pathway was identified in liver, kidney, pancreas, and small intestine. hepg2 cells also expressed these mrnas and enzymes and were shown to metabolize hyp in the culture medium to glycolate, glycine, and oxalate. [(18)o]- and [(13)c(5)]hyp were synthesized and evaluated for their use with in vitro and in vivo models. [(18)o]hyp was not suitable because of an apparent tautomerism of [(18)o]glyoxylate between enol and hydrated forms, which resulted in a loss of isotope. [(13)c(5)]hyp, however, was metabolized to [(13)c(2)]glycolate, [(13)c(2)]glycine, and [(13)c(2)]oxalate in vitro in hepg2 cells and in vivo in mice infused with [(13)c(5)]hyp. these model systems should be valuable tools for exploring various aspects of hyp metabolism and will be useful in determining whether blocking hyp catabolism is an effective therapy in the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria.  perspectives and summary 1006 introduction 1007 proline 1008 proline biosynthesis: the glutamate pathway 1008 proline biosynthesis: the om pathway 1015 proline degradation: the p5c pathway 1018 proline degradation: reguiation 1020 proline degradation: other pathways 1023 4-hydroxyprollne 1024 natural occurrence 1024 metabolism general features 1025 catabolism of free 4-hyp 1034 3-hydroxyproline 1041 metabolism 1042 3,4-dihydroxyproline 1044
the leader program was initiated in 2004 and monitors emerging linezolid resistance in sampled us medical centers. this report summarizes the data obtained in 2008, the 5th consecutive year. a total of 57 institutions participated in 2008 representing all 9 us census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6113 isolates, 101.9% compliance to protocol design). the organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were staphylococcus aureus (3156), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 856), enterococci (901), streptococcus pneumoniae (619), and viridans group (223) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (358); also, d-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in staphylococcus aureus. linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with mic(90) results ranging from 1 microg/ml (streptococci and cons) to 2 microg/ml (staphylococcus aureus and enterococci). only 0.36% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, a slight decrease from 0.45% and 0.44% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. the nonsusceptible strains (22) were staphylococcus aureus (3), cons (14), and enterococcus faecium (5) each with defined target mutations (g2576t in 19 strains; t2504a in 1 strain), mobile cfr element (1 strain staphylococcus epidermidis with an identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern to a cfr-positive staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the same center in leader 2007), or an unknown (1 strain) mechanism. the mobile cfr resistance found in a staphylococcus aureus strain in 2007 was not observed in 2008. in conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 5th year of this leader program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.64% susceptibility levels). the nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable and the plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism that emerged in staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains in 2007 showed no evidence of dissemination or increased prevalence. however, there was evidence of cfr persistence with the s. epidermidis strain. the leader program continues to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect and monitor novel oxazolidinone resistance phenotypes and genotypes.  abstract the cfr (chloramphenicol-florfenicol resistance) gene encodes a 23s rrna methyltransferase that confers resistance to linezolid. detection of linezolid resistance was evaluated in the first cfr-carrying human hospital isolate of linezolid and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (designated mrsa cm-05) by dilution and diffusion methods (including etest). the presence of cfr was investigated in isolates of staphylococci colonizing the patient's household contacts and clinical isolates recovered from patients in the same unit where mrsa cm-05 was isolated. additionally, 68 chloramphenicol-resistant colombian mrsa isolates recovered from hospitals between 2001 and 2004 were screened for the presence of the cfr gene. in addition to erm(b), the erm(a) gene was also detected in cm-05. the isolate belonged to sequence type 5 and carried staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec type i. we were unable to detect the cfr gene in any of the human staphylococci screened (either clinical or colonizing isolates). agar and broth dilution methods detected linezolid resistance in cm-05. however, the etest and disk diffusion methods failed to detect resistance after 24 h of incubation. oxazolidinone resistance mediated by the cfr gene is rare, and acquisition by a human isolate appears to be a recent event in colombia. the detection of cfr-mediated linezolid resistance might be compromised by the use of the disk diffusion or etest method.
author(s): chen, yixing; luo, xuan; hong, tianzhen | abstract: traditionally, in building energy modeling (bem) programs, occupancy inputs are deterministic and less indicative of real world scenarios, contributing to discrepancies between simulated and actual energy use in buildings. this paper presents an agent-based occupancy simulator, which models each occupant as an agent with specified movement events and statistics of space uses. to reduce the amount of data inputs, the simulator allows users to group occupants with similar behaviors as an occupant type, and spaces with similar function as a space type. it is a web-based application with friendly graphical user interface, cloud computing, and data storage. a case study is presented to demonstrate the usage of the occupancy simulator and its integration with energyplus and obfmu. it first shows the required data inputs and the results from the occupancy simulator. then, the generated occupant schedules are used in the energyplus and obfmu simulation to evaluate the impacts of occupant behavior on building energy performance. the simulation results indicate that the occupancy simulator can capture the diversity of space’s occupancy behavior rather than the static weekly profiles, and can generate realistic occupancy schedules to support building performance simulation.  building occupancy is an important basic factor in building energy simulation but it is hard to represent due to its temporal and spatial stochastic nature. this paper presents a novel approach for building occupancy simulation based on the markov chain. in this study, occupancy is handled as the straightforward result of occupant movement processes which occur among the spaces inside and outside a building. by using the markov chain method to simulate this stochastic movement process, the model can generate the location for each occupant and the zone-level occupancy for the whole building. there is no explicit or implicit constraint to the number of occupants and the number of zones in the model while maintaining a simple and clear set of input parameters. from the case study of an office building, it can be seen that the model can produce realistic occupancy variations in the office building for a typical workday with key statistical properties of occupancy such as the time of morning arrival and night departure, lunch time, periods of intermediate walking-around, etc. due to simplicity, accuracy and unrestraint, this model is sufficient and practical to simulate occupancy for building energy simulations and stochastic analysis of building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (hvac) systems.
backgroundessential oils are often used in alternative medicine as analgesic and anti-inflammatory remedies. however, the specific compounds that confer the effects of essential oils and the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. trpm8 is a thermosensitive receptor that detects cool temperatures and menthol whereas trpa1 is a sensor of noxious cold. ideally, an effective analgesic compound would activate trpm8 and inhibit trpa1.resultswe screened essential oils and fragrance chemicals showing a high ratio of human trpm8-activating ability versus human trpa1-activating ability using a ca2+-imaging method, and identified 1,8-cineole in eucalyptus oil as particularly effective. patch-clamp experiments confirmed that 1,8-cineole evoked inward currents in hek293t cells expressing human trpm8, but not human trpa1. in addition, 1,8-cineole inhibited human trpa1 currents activated by allyl isothiocyanate, menthol, fulfenamic acid or octanol in a dose-dependent manner. furthermore, in vivo sensory irritation tests showed that 1,8-cineole conferred an analgesic effect on sensory irritation produced by trpa1 agonists octanol and menthol. surprisingly, 1,4-cineole, which is structurally similar and also present in eucalyptus oil, activated both human trpm8 and human trpa1.conclusions1,8-cineole is a rare natural antagonist of human trpa1 that has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects possibly due to its inhibition of trpa1.  camphor is a naturally occurring compound that is used as a major active ingredient of balms and liniments supplied as topical analgesics. despite its long history of common medical use, the underlying molecular mechanism of camphor action is not understood. capsaicin and menthol, two other topically applied agents widely used for similar purposes, are known to excite and desensitize sensory nerves by acting on two members of transient receptor potential (trp) channel superfamily: heat-sensitive trp vanilloid subtype 1 (trpv1) and cold-sensitive trp channel m8, respectively. camphor has recently been shown to activate trpv3, and here we show that camphor also activates heterologously expressed trpv1, requiring higher concentrations than capsaicin. activation was enhanced by phospholipase c-coupled receptor stimulation mimicking inflamed conditions. similar camphor-activated trpv1-like currents were observed in isolated rat drg neurons and were strongly potentiated after activation of protein kinase c with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. camphor activation of rat trpv1 was mediated by distinct channel regions from capsaicin, as indicated by camphor activation in the presence of the competitive inhibitor capsazepine and in a capsaicin-insensitive point mutant. camphor did not activate the capsaicin-insensitive chicken trpv1. trpv1 desensitization is believed to contribute to the analgesic actions of capsaicin. we found that, although camphor activates trpv1 less effectively, camphor application desensitized trpv1 more rapidly and completely than capsaicin. conversely, trpv3 current sensitized after repeated camphor applications, which is inconsistent with the analgesic role of camphor. we also found that camphor inhibited several other related trp channels, including ankyrin-repeat trp 1 (trpa1). the camphor-induced desensitization of trpv1 and block of trpa1 may underlie the analgesic effects of camphor.
the humoral immune response plays a critical role in controlling infection, and the rapid adaptation to a broad range of pathogens depends on a highly diverse antibody repertoire. the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies in the past decade has enabled insights into this immense diversity. however, not only the variable, but also the constant region of antibodies determines their in vivo activity. antibody isotypes differ in effector functions and are thought to play a defining role in elicitation of immune responses, both in natural infection and in vaccination. we have developed an illumina miseq high-throughput sequencing protocol that allows determination of the human igg subtype alongside sequencing full-length antibody variable heavy chain regions. we thereby took advantage of the illumina procedure containing two additional short reads as identifiers. by performing paired-end sequencing of the variable regions and customizing one of the identifier sequences to distinguish igg subtypes, igg transcripts with linked information of variable regions and igg subtype can be retrieved. we applied our new method to the analysis of the igg variable region repertoire from pbmc of an hiv-1 infected individual confirmed to have serum antibody reactivity to the membrane proximal external region (mper) of gp41. we found that igg3 subtype frequencies in the memory b cell compartment increased after halted treatment and coincided with increased plasma antibody reactivity against the mper domain. the sequencing strategy we developed is not restricted to analysis of igg. it can be adopted for any ig subtyping and beyond that for any research question where phasing of distant regions on the same amplicon is needed.  background in the context of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), current findings suggest that the mucosal barrier is the major site of viral selection, transforming the complex inoculum to a small, homogeneous founder virus population. we analyzed hiv-1 transmission in relation to viral and host characteristics within the zurich primary hiv-1 infection study.   methods clonal hiv-1 envelope sequences (on average 16 clones/patient) were isolated from the first available plasma samples during the early phase of infection from 145 patients with primary hiv-1 infection. phylogenetic and tropism analyses were performed. differences of viral diversities were investigated in association with several parameters potentially influencing hiv-1 transmission, eg, concomitant sexually transmitted infections (stis) and mode of transmission.   results median viral diversity within env c2-v3-c3 region was 0.39% (range 0.04%-3.23%). viral diversity did not correlate with viral load, but it was slightly correlated with the duration of infection. neither transmission mode, gender, nor sti predicted transmission of more heterogeneous founder virus populations that were found in 16 of 145 patients (11%; diversity >1%). only 2 patients (1.4%) were assuredly infected with cxcr4-tropic hiv-1 within a r5/x4-tropic--mixed population, as revealed and confirmed using several genotypic prediction algorithms and phenotypic assays.   conclusions our findings suggest that transmission of multiple hiv-1 variants might be a complex process that is not dependent on mucosal factors alone. cxcr4-tropic viruses can be sexually transmitted in rare instances, but their clinical relevance remains to be determined.
cortical tubers are very common in tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc) and widely vary in size, appearance and location. the relationship between tuber features and clinical phenotype is unclear. the aim of the study is to propose a classification of tuber types along a spectrum of severity, using magnetic resonance imaging (mri) characteristics in 35 patients with tsc and history of epilepsy, and to investigate the relationship between tuber types and genetics, as well as clinical manifestations. three types of tubers were identified based on the mri signal intensity of their subcortical white matter component. (1) tubers type a are isointense on volumetric t1 images and subtly hyperintense on t2 weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (flair); (2) type b are hypointense on volumetric t1 images and homogeneously hyperintense on t2 weighted and flair; (3) type c are hypointense on volumetric t1 images, hyperintense on t2 weighted, and heterogeneous on flair characterized by a hypointense central region surrounded by a hyperintense rim. based on the dominant tuber type present, three distinct patient groups were also identified: patients with type a tuber dominance have a milder phenotype. patients with type c tuber dominance have more mri abnormalities such as subependymal giant cell tumors, and were more likely to have an autism spectrum disorder, a history of infantile spasms, and a higher frequency of epileptic seizures, compared to patients who have a dominance in type b tubers, and especially to those with a type a dominance.  background patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and drug-resistant epilepsy may be considered candidates for epilepsy surgery. this demands the unambiguous demonstration of the epileptogenicity of one of the tubers.   objective to test whether diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging enables differentiation of epileptogenic tubers from inert ones.   methods in 4 patients with clear unifocal interictal spike activity, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were performed. apparent diffusion coefficient maps were calculated in the identified epileptogenic tuber and compared withthose in nonepileptogenic tubers and regions of normal-appearing cortex.   results a significant increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient was found in the epileptogenic tubers. furthermore, the apparent diffusion coefficient of the nonepileptogenic tubers was significantly higher than the trace apparent diffusion coefficient of regions of normal-appearing cortex.   conclusion diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging may be of clinical importance for the identification of epileptogenic tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis and intractable epilepsy.
objective pulmonary hypertension (ph) is characterized with pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling mediated by 15-lipoxygenase (15-lo)/15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-hete) according to our previous studies. meanwhile, telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) activity is highly correlated with vascular injury and remodeling, suggesting that tert may be an essential determinant in the development of ph. the aim of this study was to determine the contribution and molecular mechanisms of tert in the pathogenesis of ph. approach and results we measured the right ventricular systolic pressure (rvsp) and ventricular weight, analyzed morphometric change of the pulmonary vessels in the hypoxia or monocrotaline treated rats. bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, transwell assay and flow cytometry in pulmonary smooth muscle cells were performed to investigate the roles and relationship of tert and 15-lo/15-hete in ph. we revealed that the expression of tert was increased in pulmonary vasculature of patients with ph and in the monocrotaline or hypoxia rat model of ph. the up-regulation of tert was associated with experimental elevated rvsp and pulmonary vascular remodeling. coimmunoprecipitation experiments identified tert as a novel interacting partner of 15-lo-2. tert and 15-lo-2 augmented protein expression of each other. in addition, the proliferation, migration and cell-cycle transition from g0/g1 phase to s phase induced by hypoxia were inhibited by tert knockdown, which were rescued by 15-hete addition. conclusions these results demonstrate that tert regulates pulmonary vascular remodeling. tert and 15-lo-2 form a positive feedback loop and together promote proliferation and migration of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, creating a self-amplifying circuit which propels pulmonary hypertension.  telomere and telomerase alterations have been reported in mood disorders. however, the role of telomerase in depression remains unclear. here we show that chronic mild stress (cms) led to a significant decrease in telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) level and telomerase activity in the hippocampus. treatment with antidepressant fluoxetine reversed the cms-induced tert and telomerase activity changes. inhibiting telomerase by systemic administration (100 mg · kg−1 · d−1, i.p., for 14 d), intrahippocampal microinjection (0.7 μmol, 2 μl), or infusion (using an osmotic minipump, 0.134 μg/μl, 0.25 μl/h) of 3′-azido-deoxythymidine (azt) resulted in depression-like behaviors and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. in contrast, overexpressing telomerase by intrahippocampal infusion of recombinant adenovirus vector expressing mouse tert (ad-mtert-gfp) led to neurogenesis upregulation, produced antidepressant-like behaviors, and prevented the cms-induced behavioral modifications. disrupting neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus by x-irradiation (15 gy) of a restricted region of mouse brain containing the hippocampus abolished the antidepressant-like effect of ad-mtert-gfp. additionally, azt had no effect on dna polymerase activity and did not cause cell damage in vitro and in vivo. microinjection of azt into the subventricular zone of lateral ventricle (0.7 μmol, 2 μl) inhibited local neurogenesis but had no behavioral effect. these results suggest that hippocampal telomerase is involved in the modulation of depression-related behaviors, possibly by regulating adult neurogenesis.
background the purpose of this study was to review surgery-proven lumbar disc herniation in adolescents with an emphasis on the distinguishing features.   methods twenty-eight adolescents between 14 and 18 years old had lumbar discectomy after conservative treatment for 9 months. indications for surgery were intractable pain and failure of conservative treatment for more than 6 weeks. lumbar spine apophyseal ring fracture was found in 10 of the 24 patients (42%) who had computed tomography studies. seven patients had piecemeal excision of the fractured apophysis together with the discectomy.   results all but three patients could raise their leg more than 70 degrees after the operation. the latest follow-up was conducted an average of 6.1 years after surgery. good or excellent results were noted in 93% of the patients. two patients had follow-up operations for recurrent disc herniation and wound infection.   conclusion apophyseal ring fracture was a feature in adolescent disc herniation that requires surgical intervention. early computed tomography study is proposed to detect apophyseal ring lesion, which may lead to failure of conservative treatment. excision of the fractured ring apophysis is suggested in addition to discectomy when the canal space is occupied.  study design. the authors examined a case series of patients under the age of 18 years treated for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. objectives. to evaluate postoperative and long-term results of surgery in patients younger than 18 years. summary of background data. there are only a few series, with controversial results, available on the surgical treatment of disc herniation in growing patients. methods. between 1975 and 1991, a consecutive series of 129 patients 9–18 years of age (average age, 16.2 years) underwent surgery for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. low back pain associated with leg pain was the main clinical symptom in 106 subjects (82%), back pain in 17 (13%), and leg pain in 6 (5%). results. short-term results were excellent or good for 123 cases (95%), with complete pain relief in 97 (75%) and moderate but incomplete relief in 26 (20%). a total of 98 (76%) long-term responses obtained at a mean follow-up of 12.4 years revealed excellent outcomes in 40% of the cases, good in 47%, and poor in 13%. ten patients (10%) underwent reintervention after 9 years on average (2 fusions and 8 re-explorations for herniated disc). conclusions. results have confirmed a tendency for outcomes to deteriorate between the short-term and long-term follow-up in young patients treated by discectomy: this tendency and the rate of reintervention (10%) confirmed the need for long-term follow-up of children and adolescents treated for disc herniation.
the reservoir for neisseria meningitidis (nm) is the human oropharynx. implementation of nm serogroup c (nmc) glycoconjugate vaccines directly reduced nmc carriage. prophylactic vaccines are now available to prevent disease caused by the five major nm disease causing serogroups (abcwy). nm serogroup b (nmb) vaccines are composed of antigens that are conserved across nm serogroups and therefore have the potential to impact all nm carriage. to assess the effect of these vaccines on carriage, standardized approaches to identify and group nm are required. real-time pcr (rt-pcr) capsule grouping assays that were internally controlled to confirm nm species were developed for eight serogroups associated with carriage (a, b, c, e, w, x, y and z). the grouping scheme was validated using diverse bacterial species associated with carriage and then used to evaluate a collection of diverse nm carriage isolates (n=234). a scheme that also included pora and ctra probes was able to speciate the isolates, while ctra also provided insights on the integrity of the polysaccharide loci. isolates were typed for the nm vaccine antigen factor h binding protein (fhbp), and were found to represent the known diversity of this antigen. the pora rt-pcr yielded positive results with all 234 of the nm carriage isolates. genogrouping assays classified 76.5% (179/234) of these isolates to a group, categorized 53 as nongenogroupable (ngg) and two as mixed results. thirty seven ngg isolates evidenced a disrupted capsular polysaccharide operon judged by a ctra negative result. only 28.6% (67/234) of the isolates were serogrouped by slide agglutination (sasg), highlighting the reduced capability of carriage strains to express capsular polysaccharide. these rt-pcr assays provide a comprehensive means to identify and genogroup n. meningitidis in carriage studies used to guide vaccination strategies and to assess the impact of novel fhbp containing vaccines on meningococcal carriage.  background in 1999, meningococcal serogroup c conjugate (mcc) vaccines were introduced in the united kingdom for those under 19 years of age. the impact of this intervention on asymptomatic carriage of meningococci was investigated to establish whether serogroup replacement or protection by herd immunity occurred.   methods multicenter surveys of carriage were conducted during vaccine introduction and on 2 successive years, resulting in a total of 48,309 samples, from which 8599 meningococci were isolated and characterized by genotyping and phenotyping.   results a reduction in serogroup c carriage (rate ratio, 0.19) was observed that lasted at least 2 years with no evidence of serogroup replacement. vaccine efficacy against carriage was 75%, and vaccination had a disproportionate impact on the carriage of sequence type (st)-11 complex serogroup c meningococci that (rate ratio, 0.06); these meningococci also exhibited high rates of capsule expression.   conclusions the impact of vaccination with mcc vaccine on the prevalence of carriage of group c meningococci was consistent with herd immunity. the high impact on the carriage of st-11 complex serogroup c could be attributed to high levels of capsule expression. high vaccine efficacy against disease in young children, who were not protected long-term by the schedule initially used, is attributed to the high vaccine efficacy against carriage in older age groups.
the concept of search tree uniication presented in this paper serves a basis for the declarative interpretation of process-based logic programs. each logic process created explicitly from a sub-goal deenes an own sub-search tree. processes of the same logic program are not independent but rely on the partial result of each other, i.e. they communicate with each other. therefore, sub-search trees are related along communication patterns. explicit communications between processes determine links between diierent search trees. the equivalent declarative notion to executing a program consisting of diierent but related logic programs is uniication of individual search trees. search tree uniication can give declarative meaning of process-based logic programs as well. search tree uniication is a higher abstraction that captures distributed logic programs in a declarative way.  the notion that computation = controlled deduction was first proposed by pay hayes [19] and more recently by bibel [2] and vaughn-pratt [31]. a similar thesis that database systems should be regarded as consisting of a relational component, which defines the logic of the data, and a control component, which stores and retrieves it, has been successfully argued by codd [10]. hewitt's argument [20] for the programming language planner, though generally regarded as an argument against logic, can also be regarded as an argument for the thesis that algorithms be regarded as consisting of both logic and control components. in this paper we shall explore some of the useful consequences of that thesis.
diabetic (db/db) mice provide an animal model of type 2 diabetes characterized by marked in vivo insulin resistance. the effect of insulin on myocardial metabolism has not been fully elucidated in this diabetic model. in the present study we tested the hypothesis that the metabolic response to insulin in db/db hearts will be diminished due to cardiac insulin resistance. insulin-induced changes in glucose oxidation (gluox) and fatty acid (fa) oxidation (faox) were measured in isolated hearts from control and diabetic mice, perfused with both low as well as high concentration of glucose and fa: 10 mm glucose/0.5 mm palmitate and 28 mm glucose/1.1 mm palmitate. both in the absence and presence of insulin, diabetic hearts showed decreased rates of gluox and elevated rates of faox. however, the insulin-induced increment in gluox, as well as the insulin-induced decrement in faox, was similar or even more pronounced in diabetic that in control hearts. during elevated fa and glucose supply, however, the effect of insulin was blunted in db/db hearts with respect to both faox and gluox. finally, insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose uptake was markedly reduced in isolated cardiomyocytes from db/db mice, whereas glucose uptake in isolated perfused db/db hearts was clearly responsive to insulin. these results show that, despite reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in isolated cardiomyocytes, isolated perfused db/db hearts are responsive to metabolic actions of insulin. these results should advocate the use of insulin therapy (glucose-insulin-potassium) in diabetic patients undergoing cardiac surgery or during reperfusion after an ischemic insult.  the metabolic phenotype of hearts has been investigated using rodent models of type 2 diabetes which exhibit obesity and insulin resistance: db/db and ob/ob mice, and zucker fatty and zdf rats. in general, cardiac fatty acid (fa) utilization is enhanced in type 2 diabetic hearts, with increased rates of fa oxidation (db/db, ob/ob and zdf models) and increased fa esterification into cellular triacylglycerols (db/db hearts). hearts from db/db and ob/ob mice and zdf rat hearts all have elevated levels of myocardial triacylglycerols, consistent with enhanced fa utilization. a number of mechanisms may be responsible for enhanced fa utilization in type 2 diabetic hearts: (i) increased fa uptake into cardiac myocytes and into mitochondria; (ii) altered mitochondrial function, with up-regulation of uncoupling proteins; and (iii) stimulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha. enhanced cardiac fa utilization in rodent type 2 diabetic models is associated with reduced cardiac contractile function, perhaps as a consequence of lipotoxicity and/or reduced cardiac efficiency. similar results have been obtained with human type 2 diabetic hearts, suggesting that pharmacological interventions that can reduce cardiac fa utilization may have beneficial effects on contractile function.
pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the united states. it is identified by its rapid, invasive progression with a profound resistance to treatments such as chemotherapy. unfortunately, there is a lack of information on how to effectively inhibit and control the rapid growth of pancreatic tumors, as well as limited information for diagnostics. with current methods, pancreatic cancer will continue to prevail as a leading cause of cancer death. we propose to study the complexity of pancreatic tumors with a systematic and analytical approach. cancer is an abnormal growth of tissue caused by uncontrolled cell division. observing the growth of these cells would prove to have a good basis to monitor the growth of a tumor. here we create a 3-d simulation of tumor growth through mathematical modeling, using data from pancreatic cells grown in vitro. using 3-d models will help to understand pancreatic tumors at cellular and molecular levels. the project aims to observe realistic growth of the tumor, accomplished from growing tumor cells on a monolayer in order to find parameters for our 3d mathematical model. this method will prove more beneficial than testing only on a monolayer cell line. although cell death and the toxicity of drug dosage can be tested using a cell monolayer alone, it does not meet the demands of testing drug delivery in a realistic tumor environment that the mathematical model would provide. the monolayer lacks the dimensions that the drug would have to travel if it were delivered to a real in vivo tumor. a possible continuation of this project in the future could be to utilize the mathematical based approach to predict optimal therapy for the pancreatic tumor in order to develop models that can better test patient care for tumors. computer modeling, another stepping stone through mathematical modeling, will possibly lead to testing the toxic effects of drugs on a 3-d model through computer modeling will aid in understanding the delivery of drugs throughout the tumor in vivo.  abstract we study solid tumor (carcinoma) growth in the nonlinear regime using boundary-integral simulations. the tumor core is nonnecrotic and no inhibitor chemical species are present. a new formulation of the classical models [18,24,8,3] is developed and it is demonstrated that tumor evolution is described by a reduced set of two dimensionless parameters and is qualitatively unaffected by the number of spatial dimensions. one parameter describes the relative rate of mitosis to the relaxation mechanisms (cell mobility and cell-to-cell adhesion). the other describes the balance between apoptosis (programmed cell-death) and mitosis. both parameters also include the effect of vascularization. our analysis and nonlinear simulations reveal that the two new dimensionless groups uniquely subdivide tumor growth into three regimes associated with increasing degrees of vascularization: low (diffusion dominated, e.g., in vitro), moderate and high vascularization, that correspond to the regimes observed in vivo. we demonstrate that critical conditions exist for which the tumor evolves to nontrivial dormant states or grows self-similarly (i.e., shape invariant) in the first two regimes. this leads to the possibility of shape control and of controlling the release of tumor angiogenic factors by restricting the tumor volume-to-surface-area ratio. away from these critical conditions, evolution may be unstable leading to invasive fingering into the external tissues and to topological transitions such as tumor breakup and reconnection. interestingly we find that for highly vascularized tumors, while they grow unbounded, their shape always stays compact and invasive fingering does not occur. this is in agreement with recent experimental observations [30] of in vivo tumor growth, and suggests that the invasive growth of highly-vascularized tumors is associated to vascular and elastic anisotropies, which are not included in the model studied here.
in this thesis, we employ the theory of stochastic processes and queueing, combinatorial theory, stochastic dynamic programing to analyze the performance of wireless sensor networks, with a focus on data retrieval time, energy consumption and measurement reliability constraints.    firstly, we analyze the time needed to retrieve a fixed number of sensor measurements from a wireless sensor network. based on these measurements, an aggregate is obtained. we take into account aspects such as transmission interference, limited, stochastic energy availability induced by the fact that the sensors harvest energy from the environment, limited transmission bandwidth. we analyze the retrieval time of measurements under centralized and decentralized sensor transmission schedules. the degree of difference between the two types of schedules, which we derive in this thesis, indicates the degree of improvement that distributed schedules can achieve.    secondly, we consider wireless caches, randomly deployed in the plane, that store a data file in a distributed manner. we provide an exact characterization of the pareto front of two conflicting objectives concerning the cost of deploying the caches in the plane and the energy cost of retrieving the data file from these caches. we analyze the pareto front under a partitioning and a network coding data caching strategy. pareto dominance is proven for the network coding strategy.    thirdly, we consider the case where sensed data is retrieved by querying either the sensor network or a central database. we formulate an optimal query processing strategy with respect to the response time of queries and the quality (freshness) of the query data. we employ a discrete-time markov decision process, which is derived by non-standard, exponential uniformization of a continuous-time markov decision process with a drift. we compare numerically the performance of this optimal policy with several heuristics, and show under which system parameters these heuristics perform close to the optimal with respect to the query response time and data quality.    the results derived in this thesis aim to provide a formal, theoretical support for the design of wireless sensor network applications related to the retrieval of reliable data, with a goal of assisting the implementation of such applications.  we consider the use of energy harvesters, in place of conventional batteries with fixed energy storage, for point-to-point wireless communications. in addition to the challenge of transmitting in a channel with time selective fading, energy harvesters provide a perpetual but unreliable energy source. in this paper, we consider the problem of energy allocation over a finite horizon, taking into account channel conditions and energy sources that are time varying, so as to maximize the throughput. two types of side information (si) on the channel conditions and harvested energy are assumed to be available: causal si (of the past and present slots) or full si (of the past, present and future slots). we obtain structural results for the optimal energy allocation, via the use of dynamic programming and convex optimization techniques. in particular, if unlimited energy can be stored in the battery with harvested energy and the full si is available, we prove the optimality of a water-filling energy allocation solution where the so-called water levels follow a staircase function.
backgroundthe majority of propulsive forces in swimming are produced from the upper body, with strong correlations between upper body strength and sprint performance. there are significant gaps in the literature relating to the impact of resistance training on swimming performance, specifically the transfer to swimming performance.objectivethe aims of this systematic literature review are to (1) explore the transfer of resistance-training modalities to swimming performance, and (2) examine the effects of resistance training on technical aspects of swimming.methodsfour online databases were searched with the following inclusion criteria: (1) journal articles with outcome measures related to swimming performance, and (2) competitive swimmers participating in a structured resistance-training programme. exclusion criteria were (1) participants with a mean age <16 years; (2) untrained, novice, masters and paraplegic swimmers; (3) triathletes and waterpolo players; (4) swimmers with injuries or illness; and (5) studies of starts and turns specifically. data were extracted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines, and the physiotherapy evidence database (pedro) scale was applied.resultsfor optimal transfer, specific, low-volume, high-velocity/force resistance-training programmes are optimal. stroke length is best achieved through resistance training with low repetitions at a high velocity/force. resisted swims are the most appropriate training modality for improving stroke rate.conclusionfuture research is needed with respect to the effects of long-term resistance-training interventions on both technical parameters of swimming and overall swimming performance. the results of such work will be highly informative for the scientific community, coaches and athletes.  abstract dragunas, aj, dickey, jp, and nolte, vw. the effect of drag suit training on 50 m freestyle performance. j strength cond res 26(4): 989–994, 2012—little research has evaluated the effects of drag suit training in swimming; these effects need to be explored further to optimize their use in training. for this 5-week training study, 18 subjects were divided evenly into 2 groups: control group and drag suit–trained group. both groups performed weekly training routines that included 3 sprint sets. these sprint sets were performed by both the groups; however, the drag suit training group wore the drag suit, and the control group wore their typical training attire. we evaluated the swimmers' 50-m performance using a test set of six 50-m sprints on a 10-minute interval before and after the training program. the test set was performed twice (on 2 different days) where the swimmers were tested once in the drag suit and once in their regular training attire; the order of testing was randomized. final time, stroke rate, and distance per stroke were collected. we observed that the drag suit–trained group exhibited a statistically significant decrease in distance per stoke while wearing the drag suit and the control group showed a significant increase in stroke rate and decrease in distance per stroke (in both suits). it is suggested to include some amounts of drag suit training in periods where swimming volume may decrease. sets that are short in distance and performed at high intensity with sufficient rest to allow swimmers to maintain high stroke integrity should help athletes maintain techniques. we suggest incorporating the drag suit into the training regimen and should be considered a valuable resistive training device for swimming.
this paper compares the performance of several machine learning algorithms for the automatic categorization of corporate announcements in the australian stock exchange (asx) signal g data stream. the article also describes some of the applications that the categorization of corporate announcements may enable. we have performed tests on two categorization tasks: market sensitivity, which indicates whether an announcement will have an impact on the market, and report type, which classifies each announcement into one of the report categories defined by the asx. we have tried neural networks, a näıve bayes classifier, and support vector machines and achieved good results.  statistical approaches to processing natural language text have become dominant in recent years. this foundational text is the first comprehensive introduction to statistical natural language processing (nlp) to appear. the book contains all the theory and algorithms needed for building nlp tools. it provides broad but rigorous coverage of mathematical and linguistic foundations, as well as detailed discussion of statistical methods, allowing students and researchers to construct their own implementations. the book covers collocation finding, word sense disambiguation, probabilistic parsing, information retrieval, and other applications.
sea surface temperature fields (1870–2100) forced by co2-induced climate change under the ipcc sres a1b co2 scenario, from three world climate research programme coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 (wcrp cmip3) models (ccsm3, csiro mk 3.5, and gfdl cm 2.1), were used to examine how coral sensitivity to thermal stress and rates of adaption affect global projections of coral-reef bleaching. the focus of this study was two-fold, to: (1) assess how the impact of degree-heating-month (dhm) thermal stress threshold choice affects potential bleaching predictions and (2) examine the effect of hypothetical adaptation rates of corals to rising temperature. dhm values were estimated using a conventional threshold of 1°c and a variability-based threshold of 2σ above the climatological maximum coral adaptation rates were simulated as a function of historical 100-year exposure to maximum annual ssts with a dynamic rather than static climatological maximum based on the previous 100 years, for a given reef cell. within ccsm3 simulations, the 1°c threshold predicted later onset of mild bleaching every 5 years for the fraction of reef grid cells where 1°c > 2σ of the climatology time series of annual sst maxima (1961–1990). alternatively, dhm values using both thresholds, with csiro mk 3.5 and gfdl cm 2.1 ssts, did not produce drastically different onset timing for bleaching every 5 years. across models, dhms based on 1°c thermal stress threshold show the most threatened reefs by 2100 could be in the central and western equatorial pacific, whereas use of the variability-based threshold for dhms yields the coral triangle and parts of micronesia and melanesia as bleaching hotspots. simulations that allow corals to adapt to increases in maximum sst drastically reduce the rates of bleaching. these findings highlight the importance of considering the thermal stress threshold in dhm estimates as well as potential adaptation models in future coral bleaching projections.  [1] we present the met office hadley centre's sea ice and sea surface temperature (sst) data set, hadisst1, and the nighttime marine air temperature (nmat) data set, hadmat1. hadisst1 replaces the global sea ice and sea surface temperature (gisst) data sets and is a unique combination of monthly globally complete fields of sst and sea ice concentration on a 1° latitude-longitude grid from 1871. the companion hadmat1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5° latitude-longitude grid and incorporates new corrections for the effect on nmat of increasing deck (and hence measurement) heights. hadisst1 and hadmat1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. the sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. ssts near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between sst and sea ice concentration. hadisst1 compares well with other published analyses, capturing trends in global, hemispheric, and regional sst well, containing sst fields with more uniform variance through time and better month-to-month persistence than those in gisst. hadmat1 is more consistent with sst and with collocated land surface air temperatures than previous nmat data sets.
serum uric acid (ua) is positively associated with hypertension (htn). htn is common in pediatric patients receiving hemodialysis (hd) and peritoneal dialysis (pd). we assessed the relationship between ua and bp in 63 pediatric dialysis patients by measuring pre-treatment ua levels and bp in hd patients and in-center ua levels and blood pressure (bp) in pd patients. ua levels were similar in both groups [6.8 ± 0.2 (hd) vs. 6.5 ± 0.3 (pd), p = 0.6]. pre-treatment systolic bp percentile was associated with a high ua level [91.9 ± 2.3 (>6.0 mg/dl) vs. 79.3 ± 5.8 mm hg (≤6.0 mg/dl), p = 0.01] in hd patients only. there was a negative relationship between ua and dialysis vintage (r = −0.31, p = 0.01). in both groups, there was no relationship between ua and kt/v. in hd patients, fluid overload was unrelated to ua level [4.2 ± 0.6% (≤6.0 mg/dl) vs. 4.3 ± 0.3% (>6.0 mg/dl), p = 0.9]. moreover, pre-hd treatment systolic bp percentile correlated with ua (beta 0.36, p = 0.02) independent of volume. ua levels were higher in patients receiving anti-hypertensive medications [6.3 ± 0.2 (no meds] vs 7.0 ± 0.2 (bp meds) mg/dl,  p= 0.01]. finally, there was no relationship between serum ua and normalized protein catabolic rate (r = 0.14; p = 0.4). in summary, serum ua impacts bp in pediatric hd patients, independent of volume, nutritional and weight status.  achieving dry weight during hemodialysis (hd) while minimizing symptoms is critical for optimizing patient outcome by preventing chronic fluid overload, hypertension, and cardiomyopathy. dry weight changes frequently in children because of growth and development and waxing and waning of appetite. we have previously shown non-invasive hematocrit monitoring (nivm) helps to decrease intradialytic symptoms, while still achieving target dry weights in children receiving chronic hd. in the current study, we prospectively evaluated an nivm-guided ultrafiltration (uf) management algorithm to determine target dry weight in nine pediatric patients (mean age 16.6±2.8 years, mean weight 41.6±11.1 kg). use of nivm could potentially lead to overly aggressive uf with increased interdialytic symptoms, post treatment thirst, and interdialytic weight gain (idwg). to evaluate the effectiveness of our nivm uf algorithm, we studied the effect of three different nivm-guided uf models (100%, 90%, and 80% uf models) on intradialytic and interdialytic symptoms, pre-/post-treatment blood pressure (bp), and percentage idwg. to assess interdialytic symptoms, patients completed two questionnaires, one for each day between treatments. no statistically significant difference was seen between the three uf models with respect to intradialytic or interdialytic symptoms, pre-/post-hd bp, or percentage idwg. only one of nine patients received non-acei chronic antihypertensive medication, yet all patients had pre- and post-hd bp <95th percentile for age and height. the current study suggests that routine determination of target dry weight using nivm and aiming for 100% uf helps to achieve the target dry weight, reduces both the risk of chronic fluid overload and the need for antihypertensive medication, and does not lead to increased intra- or interdialytic symptomatology in pediatric patients treated with chronic hd.
abstract. in β-lactam producing microorganisms, the first step in the biosynthesis of the β-lactam ring is the condensation of three amino acid precursors: α-aminoadipate, l-cysteine and d-valine. in nocardia lactamdurans and other cephamycin-producing actinomycetes, α-aminoadipate is generated from l-lysine by two sequential enzymatic steps. the first step involves a lysine-6-aminotransferase activity (lat), considered to be one of the rate-limiting steps for antibiotic biosynthesis. here, we report the effect of exogenous lysine on antibiotic production by n. lactamdurans ma4213. lysine-supplemented cultures showed higher titers of cephamycin c, an effect that was more significant at early fermentation times. the increase in cephamycin c production was not quantitatively correlated with specific lat activity in lysine-supplemented cultures. observation of a positive effect of lysine on cephamycin c production by n. lactamdurans was dependent on carbon source availability in the culture media. supplementation of the culture media with exogenous lysine did not affect the mrna levels of the early biosynthetic genes controlled by the bidirectional promoter. these results indicate that l-lysine is required not only for antibiotic biosynthesis, but particularly as carbon or nitrogen source.  abstractl-lysine is known to stimulate production of β-lactam antibiotics bystreptomyces clavuligerus via provision of the lysine breakdown product,l-α-aminoadipic acid, which is a limiting precursor. previous investigations utilized levels of 10–20 mml-lysine as an addition to chemically-defined media resulting in 50–100% improvement in antibiotic production. we were surprised to note that as the concentration was further increased, the organism responded by producing even higher titers of antibiotics. the optimum concentration of 100 mml-lysine yielded an approximate 500% increase in production with only minor effects on growth.dl- andd-lysine also exerted enhancements suggesting the presence of a lysine racemase or some other route fromd-lysine tol-α-aminoadipate in this organism;d-lysine was considerably less potent thandl- orl-lysine.
groups of adult male sprague dawley rats (64 rats each) were exposed for 8 months to electromagnetic fields (emf) of two different field strength combinations: 5microt - 1kv/m and 100microt - 5kv/m. a third group was sham exposed. field exposure was 8 hrs/day for 5 days/week. blood samples were collected for hematology determinations before the onset of exposure and at 12 week intervals. at sacrifice, liver, heart, mesenteric lymph nodes, bone marrow, and testes were collected for morphology and histology assessments, while the pineal gland and brain were collected for biochemical determinations. at both field strength combinations, no pathological changes were observed in animal growth rate, in morphology and histology of the collected tissue specimens (liver, heart, mesenteric lymph nodes, testes, bone marrow), and in serum chemistry. an increase in norepinephrine levels occurred in the pineal gland of rats exposed to the higher field strength. the major changes in the brain involved the opioid system in frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and hippocampus. from the present findings it may be hypothesized that emf may cause alteration of some brain functions.  we studied the effects of an acute (45 min) exposure to a 60 hz magnetic field on sodium-dependent, high-affinity choline uptake in the brain of the rat. decreases in uptake were observed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus after the animals were exposed to a magnetic field at flux densities > or = 0.75 mt. these effects of the magnetic field were blocked by pretreating the animals with the narcotic antagonist naltrexone, but not by the peripheral opioid antagonist, naloxone methiodide. these data indicate that the magnetic-field-induced decreases in high-affinity choline uptake in the rat brain were mediated by endogenous opioids in the central nervous systems.
impaired activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (gcr) results in the inherited metabolic disorder known as gaucher disease. current treatment consists of enzyme replacement therapy by administration of exogenous gcr. although effective, it is exceptionally expensive, and patients worldwide have a limited access to this medicine. in brazil, the public healthcare system provides the drug free of charge for all gaucher's patients, which reaches the order of $ 84 million per year. however, the production of gcr by public institutions in brazil would reduce significantly the therapy costs. here, we describe a robust protocol for the generation of a cell line producing recombinant human gcr. the protein was expressed in cho-dxb11 (dhfr−) cells after stable transfection and gene amplification with methotrexate. as expected, glycosylated gcr was detected by immunoblotting assay both as cell-associated (~64 and 59 kda) and secreted (63–69 kda) form. analysis of subclones allowed the selection of stable cho cells producing a secreted functional enzyme, with a calculated productivity of 5.14 pg/cell/day for the highest producer. although being laborious, traditional methods of screening high-producing recombinant cells may represent a valuable alternative to generate expensive biopharmaceuticals in countries with limited resources.  the purpose of this review is to describe the current status and to highlight several emerging trends in the manufacture of recombinant therapeutic proteins in cultivated mammalian cells, focusing on chinese hamster ovary cells as the major production host. over the past 25 years, specific and volumetric productivities for recombinant cell lines have increased about 20-fold as the result of improvements in media and bioprocess design. future yield increases are expected to come from further developments in gene delivery and genetic selection for more efficient recovery of high-producing cell lines and in high-throughput cultivation systems to simplify medium design and bioprocess development. other emerging trends in protein manufacturing that are discussed include the use of disposal bioreactors and transient gene expression. we specifically highlight current research in our own laboratories.
backgroundin previous studies, female monkeys self-administered more oral phencyclidine (pcp) than males, and pcp intake differed by phase of menstrual cycle.objectivesthe purpose of this study was to examine sex and hormonal influences on oral cocaine self-administration in male and female rhesus monkeys in the follicular vs. luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, with concurrent access to an alternative nondrug reward, saccharin (sacc) vs. water.materials and methodsconcurrent access to cocaine (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg/ml) and sacc or water was available from two drinking spouts under concurrent fixed-ratio (fr) 2, 4, and 8 schedules during daily 3-h sessions.resultscocaine deliveries were similar in males and females in the females’ luteal phase, but cocaine deliveries were higher in females during the follicular phase than the luteal phase and compared to males. when sacc was available, cocaine deliveries were reduced in females in the follicular phase of the cycle, and cocaine intake (mg/kg) was reduced in males and in females’ follicular and luteal phases.conclusionsaccess to concurrent sacc (vs. water) reduced cocaine intake (mg/kg) in males and in females during both menstrual phases, and the magnitude of the reduction in cocaine intake was greatest during the females’ follicular phase. thus, a nondrug alternative reward, sacc, is a viable alternative treatment for reducing cocaine’s rewarding effects on male and female monkeys, and reductions in cocaine seeking were optimal in the females’ luteal phase.  substantive evidence indicates that there are sex differences in the reinforcing effects of drugs, and gonadal steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, likely contribute to these differences. among females, subjective effects of drugs differ as a function of menstrual cycle phase. the purpose of the present study was to compare oral self-administration of phencyclidine (pcp) in female rhesus monkeys (macaca mulatta) across different phases of the menstrual cycle. since the 28-day menstrual cycle of non-human primates is similar to that of humans, this model could provide important evidence supporting the implication that changes in the levels of gonadal hormones across menstrual phase can alter a drug's reinforcing effects. oral self-administration of several concentrations of pcp (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/ml) was examined in three sexually mature female monkeys during 3-h experimental sessions. menstrual cycle phase was determined by onset of menses and verified by examining vaginal cytology. pcp self-administration was greater during the luteal phase at the 0.125 and 0.25 mg/ml concentrations, which is normally characterized by high levels of progesterone and moderate levels of estrogen, than during the follicular phase, when levels of estrogen are increasing and progesterone levels are low. when examined within each phase, numbers of pcp deliveries were highest during the mid-luteal phase, compared to the early and mid-follicular phases. no differences in self-administration were observed between early and mid-follicular phases, but a significant difference in pcp deliveries was found between mid- and late luteal phases at the lowest concentration of pcp tested. the results from this study suggest that pcp's reinforcing effects in female monkeys differ as a function of menstrual cycle phase.
purpose the purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors affecting the recovery period of lower lip hypoesthesia after sagittal split ramus osteotomy (ssro) in mandibular prognathism patients using multivariate analysis, retrospectively.   subjects and methods the subjects were 222 patients (444 sides) who underwent bilateral ssro setback surgery with and without le fort i osteotomy. trigeminal nerve hypoesthesia at the region of the lower lip was assessed bilaterally by the trigeminal somatosensory-evoked potential (tsep) method pre- and post-operatively. recovery period was determined as the time when tsep was first measurable post-operatively. age, sex, presence or absence of third molars, setback amount and osteotomy type and fixation method were selected as covariates in the multivariate analysis. the factor affecting the recovery period in lower lip hypoesthesia was examined with cox's proportional hazard regression.   results sex and osteotomy fixation method affected the recovery period in lower lip hypoesthesia significantly (p = 0.0132 and p = 0.0394). however, the other factors did not affect the recovery period.   conclusion this study suggested that sex and osteotomy type and fixation method may affect the recovery period in lower lip hypoesthesia after ssro setback surgery.  purpose the purpose of this study was to compare objectively, the recovery of hypoestheia of the lower lip following orthognathic surgery using different procedures (sagittal split ramus osteotomy [ssro]) and intra-oral vertical ramus osteotomy (ivro)) and fixation methods (monocortical plate fixation and bi-cortical plate fixation). hypoesthesia was evaluated using the trigeminal somatosensory-evoked potential (tsep).   patients and methods the subjects consisted of 174 patients (348 sides) with mandibular prognathism with or without asymmetry, who underwent mandibular ramus osteotomies using different fixation types. the patients were divided into 4 groups. the oam group consisted of 128 sides who had ssro using the obwegeser method with mono-cortical absorbable plate fixation, the odtm group consisted of 84 sides who had the obwegeser-dal pont method with mono-cortical titanium plate fixation, the otb group consisted of 32 sides who had the obwegeser method with bi-cortical titanium plate fixation and the vo group consisted of 104 sides who underwent ivro according to the bell method without fixation. trigeminal nerve hypoestheia at the region of the lower lip was assessed bilaterally by the tsep method. an electroencephalograph recording system (neuropack sigma; nion koden corp., tokyo, japan) was used to analyze the potentials. each patient was evaluated pre-operatively and then post-operatively at 1 and 2 weeks, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1 year.   results the mean measurable period and standard deviation of tsep of the lower lip in the oam group was 5.2 +/- 9.9 weeks, 10.9 +/- 13.1 weeks in the odtm group, 7.8 +/- 4.5 weeks in the otb group, and 2.5 +/- 6.3 weeks in the vo group. there were significant differences between the oam and odtm groups (p < .0001), the odtm and otb groups (p = .0001), the otb and vo groups (p = .0221), the oam and vo groups (p < .0001), and the odtm and vo groups (p < .0001).   conclusion this study proved using objective measurements that the recovery period from hypoesthesia of the lower lip following orthognathic surgery was dependent on the surgical procedure. recovery in lower lip hypoesthesia after ivro was significantly earlier than ssro.
backgroundhealth consumers have moved away from a reliance on medical practitioner advice to more independent decision processes and so their information search processes have subsequently widened. this study examined how persons with back pain searched for alternative treatment types and service providers. that is, what information do they seek and how; what sources do they use and why; and by what means do they search for it?methods12 persons with back pain were interviewed. the method used was convergent interviewing. this involved a series of semi-structured questions to obtain open-ended answers. the interviewer analysed the responses and refined the questions after each interview, to converge on the dominant factors influencing decisions about treatment patterns.resultspersons with back pain mainly search their memories and use word of mouth (their doctor and friends) for information about potential treatments and service providers. their search is generally limited due to personal, provider-related and information-supply reasons. however, they did want in-depth information about the alternative treatments and providers in an attempt to establish apriori their efficacy in treating their specific back problems. they searched different sources depending on the type of information they required.conclusionsthe findings differ from previous studies about the types of information health consumers require when searching for information about alternative or mainstream healthcare services. the results have identified for the first time that limited information availability was only one of three categories of reasons identified about why persons with back pain do not search for more information particularly from external non-personal sources.  this research used the somewhat new methodology of convergent interviews to develop a conceptual framework about relationship constructs in an internet environment. more generally, this article describes and illustrates the processes and the strengths of convergent interviewing to investigate under‐researched areas, and compares it with alternative qualitative techniques like in‐depth interviews, case research and focus groups. the illustration involves interviews conducted with marketing managers and business consultants from ten service companies, about internet and relationship marketing. it is argued that convergent interviewing is more appropriate than some other qualitative methods to investigate under‐researched areas where there are few experts because it provides a way of quickly converging on key issues in the area, an efficient mechanism for data analysis after each interview, and a way of deciding when to stop collecting data. convergent interviews could become another useful qualitative research method to explore new issues about emerging marketing phenomena.
university of minnesota ph.d. dissertation. october 2013. major: plant pathology. advisor: linda l. kinkel. 1 pdf file (viii, 166 pages) + 2 supplementary files (word and excel)  understanding how microbial genotypes are arrayed in space is crucial for identifying local factors that may influence the spatial distribution of genetic diversity. in this study we investigated variation in 16s rdna sequences and rep-pcr fingerprints of streptomyces stains isolated from prairie soil among three locations and four soil depths. substantial variation in streptomyces otu (operational taxonomic unit) and box-pcr fingerprint diversity was found among locations within a limited spatial area (1 m2). further, phylogenetic lineages at each location were distinct. however, there was little variation in genetic diversity among isolates from different soil depths and similar phylogenetic lineages were found at each depth. some clones were found at a localized scale while other clones had a relatively widespread distribution. there was poor correspondence between 16s rdna groupings and rep-pcr fingerprint groupings. the finding of distinct phylogenetic lineages and the variation in spatial distribution of clones suggests that selection pressures may vary over the soil landscape.
the randomized controlled trial (rct) is generally accepted as the most reliable method of conducting clinical research. to obtain an unbiased evaluation of the effectiveness of spine surgery, patients should be randomly assigned to either new or standard treatment. the aim of the present article is to provide a short overview of the advantages and challenges of rcts and to present a summary of the conclusions of the cochrane reviews in spine surgery and later published trials in order to evaluate their contribution to quality management and feasibility in practice. from the searches, 130 rcts were included, 95 from cochrane reviews and systematic reviews, and 35 from additional search. no study comparing surgery with sham surgery was identified. the first rct in spine surgery was published in 1974 and compared debridement and ambulatory treatment in tuberculosis of the spine. the contribution of rcts in spinal surgery has markedly increased over the last 10 years, which indicates that rcts are feasible in this field. the results demonstrate missing quality specifications. despite the number of published trials there is conflicting or limited evidence to support various techniques of instrumentation. the only intervention that receives strong evidence is discectomy for faster relief in carefully selected patients due to lumbar disc prolapse with sciatica. for future trials, authors, referees, and editors are recommended to follow the consort statement. rcts provide evidence to support clinical opinions before implementation of new techniques, but the individual clinical experience is still important for the doctor who has to face the patient.  background surgical investigations and interventions account for large health care utilisation and costs, but the scientific evidence for most procedures is still limited.   objectives degenerative conditions affecting the lumbar spine are variously described as lumbar spondylosis or degenerative disc disease (which we regarded as one entity) and may be associated with back pain and associated leg symptoms, instability, spinal stenosis and/or degenerative spondylolisthesis. the objective of this review was to assess current scientific evidence on the effectiveness of surgical interventions for degenerative lumbar spondylosis.   search strategy we searched central, medline, pubmed, spine and issls abstracts, with citation tracking from the retrieved articles. we also corresponded with experts. all data found up to 31 march 2004 are included.   selection criteria randomised (rcts) or quasi-randomised trials of surgical treatment of lumbar spondylosis.   data collection and analysis two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published papers. additional information was sought from the authors if necessary.   main results thirty-one published rcts of all forms of surgical treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylosis were identified. the trials varied in quality: only the more recent trials used appropriate methods of randomization, blinding and independent assessment of outcome. most of the earlier published results were of technical surgical outcomes with some crude ratings of clinical outcome. more of the recent trials also reported patient-centered outcomes of pain or disability, but there is still very little information on occupational outcomes. there was a particular lack of long term outcomes beyond two to three years. seven heterogeneous trials on spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis and nerve compression permitted limited conclusions. two new trials on the effectiveness of fusion showed conflicting results. one showed that fusion gave better clinical outcomes than conventional physiotherapy, while the other showed that fusion was no better than a modern exercise and rehabilitation programme. eight trials showed that instrumented fusion produced a higher fusion rate (though that needs to be qualified by the difficulty of assessing fusion in the presence of metal-work), but did not improve clinical outcomes, while there is other evidence that it may be associated with higher complication rates. three trials with conflicting results did not permit any conclusions about the relative effectiveness of anterior, posterior or circumferential fusion. preliminary results of two small trials of intra-discal electrotherapy showed conflicting results. preliminary data from three trials of disc arthroplasty did not permit any firm conclusions.   authors' conclusions limited evidence is now available to support some aspects of surgical practice. surgeons should be encouraged to perform further rcts in this field.
chronic kidney disease (ckd) is a worldwide public health threat that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular complications, including left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh). novel therapeutic targets are needed to design treatments to alleviate the cardiovascular burden of ckd. previously, we demonstrated that circulating concentrations of fibroblast growth factor (fgf) 23 rise progressively in ckd and induce lvh through an unknown fgf receptor (fgfr)-dependent mechanism. here, we report that fgf23 exclusively activates fgfr4 on cardiac myocytes to stimulate phospholipase cγ/calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated t cell signaling. a specific fgfr4-blocking antibody inhibits fgf23-induced hypertrophy of isolated cardiac myocytes and attenuates lvh in rats with ckd. mice lacking fgfr4 do not develop lvh in response to elevated fgf23, whereas knockin mice carrying an fgfr4 gain-of-function mutation spontaneously develop lvh. thus, fgf23 promotes lvh by activating fgfr4, thereby establishing fgfr4 as a pharmacological target for reducing cardiovascular risk in ckd.  chronic kidney disease (ckd) is a public health epidemic that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular disease. left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) is an important mechanism of cardiovascular disease in individuals with ckd. elevated levels of fgf23 have been linked to greater risks of lvh and mortality in patients with ckd, but whether these risks represent causal effects of fgf23 is unknown. here, we report that elevated fgf23 levels are independently associated with lvh in a large, racially diverse ckd cohort. fgf23 caused pathological hypertrophy of isolated rat cardiomyocytes via fgf receptor-dependent activation of the calcineurin-nfat signaling pathway, but this effect was independent of klotho, the coreceptor for fgf23 in the kidney and parathyroid glands. intramyocardial or intravenous injection of fgf23 in wild-type mice resulted in lvh, and klotho-deficient mice demonstrated elevated fgf23 levels and lvh. in an established animal model of ckd, treatment with an fgf-receptor blocker attenuated lvh, although no change in blood pressure was observed. these results unveil a klotho-independent, causal role for fgf23 in the pathogenesis of lvh and suggest that chronically elevated fgf23 levels contribute directly to high rates of lvh and mortality in individuals with ckd.
the intestine exerts a considerable influence over urinary oxalate in two ways, through the absorption of dietary oxalate and by serving as an adaptive extra-renal pathway for elimination of this waste metabolite. knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for oxalate absorption and secretion by the intestine therefore have significant implications for understanding the etiology of hyperoxaluria, as well as offering potential targets for future treatment strategies for calcium oxalate kidney stone disease. in this review, we present the recent developments and advances in this area over the past 10 years, and put to the test some of the new ideas that have emerged during this time, using human and mouse models. a key focus for our discussion are the membrane-bound anion exchangers, belonging to the slc26 gene family, some of which have been shown to participate in transcellular oxalate absorption and secretion. this has offered the opportunity to not only examine the roles of these specific transporters, revealing their importance to oxalate homeostasis, but to also probe the relative contributions made by the active transcellular and passive paracellular components of oxalate transport across the intestine. we also discuss some of the various physiological stimuli and signaling pathways which have been suggested to participate in the adaptation and regulation of intestinal oxalate transport. finally, we offer an update on research into oxalobacter formigenes, alongside recent investigations of other oxalate-degrading gut bacteria, in both laboratory animals and humans.  active transcellular oxalate transport in the mammalian intestine contributes to the homeostasis of this important lithogenic anion. several members of the slc26a gene family of anion exchangers have a measurable oxalate affinity and are expressed along the gut, apically and basolaterally. mouse slc26a6 (pat1) targets to the apical membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine, and its deletion results in net oxalate absorption and hyperoxaluria. apical exchangers of the slc26a family that mediate oxalate absorption have not been established, yet the slc26a3 [downregulated in adenoma (dra)] protein is a candidate mediator of oxalate uptake. we evaluated the role of dra in intestinal oxalate and cl(-) transport by comparing unidirectional and net ion fluxes across short-circuited segments of small (ileum) and large (cecum and distal colon) intestine from wild-type (wt) and dra knockout (ko) mice. in wt mice, all segments demonstrated net oxalate and cl(-) absorption to varying degrees. in ko mice, however, all segments exhibited net anion secretion, which was consistently, and solely, due to a significant reduction in the absorptive unidirectional fluxes. in ko mice, daily urinary oxalate excretion was reduced 66% compared with that in wt mice, while urinary creatinine excretion was unchanged. we conclude that dra mediates a predominance of the apical uptake of oxalate and cl(-) absorbed in the small and large intestine of mice under short-circuit conditions. the large reductions in urinary oxalate excretion underscore the importance of transcellular intestinal oxalate absorption, in general, and, more specifically, the importance of the dra exchanger in oxalate homeostasis.
objective: we aimed to determine the pharmacokinetics (pk) of n-acetylcysteine (nac) at rest and during exercise when given by continuous intravenous infusion intended to maintain relatively constant plasma concentrations. methods: plasma concentrations of nac were measured in 24 healthy male subjects during and after a two-stage intravenous infusion designed to provide constant nac concentrations during cycling exercise, including intense exercise to fatigue. results: a three-compartment, open pk model was the best fit using population pk analysis with nonmem. whole-body clearance (cl) was 0.58 l kg−1 h−1 (95% ci 0.44–0.72) for reduced nac (nacr) and 0.16 (0.13–0.20) l kg−1 h−1 for total nac (nact). the central volume of distribution (v1) was 0.064 (0.008–0.12) l kg−1 for nacr and 0.037 (0.02–0.06) l kg−1 for nact. exercise was a significant covariate in the model, resulting in a 25 and 23% reduction in cl of nacr and nact, respectively. v1 in our subjects was smaller than expected, resulting in higher-than-anticipated initial concentrations of nac. despite these findings, the incidence of adverse effects attributable to nac was minimal without using prophylactic or concomitant drug therapy. conclusions: nac can be given to healthy exercising men by intravenous infusion and to the plasma concentrations seen in this study with minimal adverse effects due to the drug. the pk parameters of nac at rest in volunteers are consistent with previously reported values and are significantly altered by vigorous cycling exercise.  the production of reactive oxygen species in skeletal muscle is linked with muscle fatigue. this study investigated whether the antioxidant compound n-acetylcysteine (nac) augments time to fatigue during prolonged, submaximal cycling exercise. seven men completed a double-blind, crossover study, receiving nac or placebo before and during cycling exercise, comprising 45 min at 70% of peak oxygen consumption (vo2 peak) and then to fatigue at 90% vo2 peak. nac was intravenously infused at 125 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 15 min and then 25 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 20 min before and throughout exercise, which was continued until fatigue. arterialized venous blood was analyzed for nac concentration, hematology, and plasma electrolytes. nac induced no serious adverse reactions and did not affect hematology, acid-base status, or plasma electrolytes. time to fatigue was reproducible in preliminary trials (coefficient of variation 7.4 +/- 1.2%) and was not augmented by nac (nac 14.6 +/- 4.5 min; control 12.8 +/- 5.4 min). however, time to fatigue during nac trials was correlated with vo2 peak (r = 0.78; p < 0.05), suggesting that nac effects on performance may be dependent on training status. the rise in plasma k+ concentration at fatigue was attenuated by nac (p < 0.05). the ratio of rise in k+ concentration to work and the percentage change in time to fatigue tended to be inversely related (r = -0.71; p < 0.07). further research is required to clarify a possible training status-dependent effect of nac on muscle performance and k+ regulation.
backgroundhox genes are known to play a key role in shaping the body plan of metazoans. evolutionary dynamics of these genes is therefore essential in explaining patterns of evolutionary diversity. among extant sarcopterygians comprising both lobe-finned fishes and tetrapods, our knowledge of the hox genes and clusters has largely been restricted in several model organisms such as frogs, birds and mammals. some evolutionary gaps still exist, especially for those groups with derived body morphology or occupying key positions on the tree of life, hindering our understanding of how hox gene inventory varied along the sarcopterygian lineage.resultswe determined the hox gene inventory for six sarcopterygian groups: lungfishes, caecilians, salamanders, snakes, turtles and crocodiles by comprehensive pcr survey and genome walking. variable hox genes in each of the six sarcopterygian group representatives, compared to the human hox gene inventory, were further validated for their presence/absence by pcr survey in a number of related species representing a broad evolutionary coverage of the group. turtles, crocodiles, birds and placental mammals possess the same 39 hox genes. hoxd12 is absent in snakes, amphibians and probably lungfishes. hoxb13 is lost in frogs and caecilians. lobe-finned fishes, amphibians and squamate reptiles possess hoxc3. hoxc1 is only present in caecilians and lobe-finned fishes. similar to coelacanths, lungfishes also possess hoxa14, which is only found in lobe-finned fishes to date. our hox gene variation data favor the lungfish-tetrapod, turtle-archosaur and frog-salamander relationships and imply that the loss of hoxd12 is not directly related to digit reduction.conclusionsour newly determined hox inventory data provide a more complete scenario for evolutionary dynamics of hox genes along the sarcopterygian lineage. limbless, worm-like caecilians and snakes possess similar hox gene inventories to animals with less derived body morphology, suggesting changes to their body morphology are likely due to other modifications rather than changes to hox gene numbers. furthermore, our results provide basis for future sequencing of the entire hox clusters of these animals.  hox genes code for transcription factors that play a major role in the development of all animal phyla. in invertebrates these genes usually occur as tightly linked cluster, with a few exceptions where the clusters have been dissolved. only in vertebrates multiple clusters have been demonstrated which arose by duplication from a single ancestral cluster. this history of hox cluster duplications, in particular during the early elaboration of the vertebrate body plan, is still poorly understood. in this paper we report the results of a pcr survey on genomic dna of the pacific hagfish eptatretus stoutii. hagfishes are one of two clades of recent jawless fishes that are an offshoot of the early radiation of jawless vertebrates. our data provide evidence for at least 33 distinct hox genes in the hagfish genome, which is most compatible with the hypothesis of multiple hox clusters. the largest number, seven, of distinct homeobox fragments could be assigned to paralog group 9, which could imply that the hagfish has more than four clusters. quartet mapping reveals that within each paralog group the hagfish sequences are statistically more closely related to gnathostome hox genes than with either amphioxus or lamprey genes. these results support two assumptions about the history of hox genes: (1) the association of hagfish homeobox sequences with gnathostome sequences suggests that at least one hox cluster duplication event happened in the stem of vertebrates, i.e., prior to the most recent common ancestor of jawed and jawless vertebrates. (2) the high number of paralog group 9 sequences in hagfish and the phylogenetic position of hagfish suggests that the hagfish lineage underwent additional independent hox cluster/-gene duplication events.
the dystrophin-associated protein complex (dapc), consisting of dystrophin, dystroglycans, sarcoglycans, dystrobrevins and syntrophins, provides a linkage between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. the disruption of dapc leads to duchenne/becker muscular dystrophy and other neuromuscular diseases. although adipose-derived stem cells had been used for the experimental treatment of duchenne/becker disease with promising results, little is known on the expression and function of dapc in adipose tissue. here we show that visceral and subcutaneous rat adipose depots express mrnas for all known dystrophin isoforms, utrophin, α- and β-dystrobrevins, and α-, βi-, βii-, and γii-syntrophins. visceral and subcutaneous rat preadipocytes express dp116 and dp71 mrnas and proteins, and this expression is differentially regulated during adipogenesis. rat preadipocytes also express β-dystrobrevin, α-, βi-, βii- and γii-syntrophins, β-dystroglycan and β-, δ-, and ε-sarcoglycans with no changes during adipogenesis. we also show that α-dystrobrevin increases their expression during adipose differentiation and extracellular matrix differentially regulates the expression of dystrophin isoforms mrnas during adipogenesis. our results show that dapc components are expressed in adipose tissues and suggest that this complex has a role on the adipose biology.  we investigated the involvement of caveolin‐1 and the cytoskeletal proteins, actin and vimentin, in the adipogenesis of bovine intramuscular preadipocyte (bip) cells. immunoblot analysis demonstrated that levels of caveolin‐1 and actin gradually increased during adipose conversion in bip cells, whereas a slight decrease was observed for vimentin. we found that part of the vimentin was clearly distributed to caveolin‐1‐enriched membrane fractions in bip cells, but actin was not. during adipogenesis of bip cells, treatment with the tubulin depolymerizer, nocodazole, significantly increased intracellular triglyceride accumulation compared to non‐treated cells. immunocytochemical analysis showed that actin microfilaments were significantly disrupted in nocodazole‐treated cells. also, a decrease in the localization of vimentin in caveolin‐1‐enriched fractions and a failure of vimentin to co‐immunoisolate with caveolin‐1 were observed in nocodazole‐treated cells. these results suggest that a rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins has a role in the intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets during adipogenesis of bip cells.
polymorphisms in ugt1a9 were associated with reduced toxicity and increased response to irinotecan in cancer patients. udp-glucuronosyltransferase (ugt) protein expression, glucuronidation activities for 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (sn-38), and probe substrates of the ugt1a9 and ugt1a1 were measured in 48 human livers to clarify the role of ugt1a9 variants on the in vitro glucuronidation of sn-38. genotypes were assessed for ugt1a9 (–2152c>t, –275t>a, and –118t9>10), three novel ugt1a9 variants (–5366g>t, –4549t>c, and i399c>t), and ugt1a1 (–53ta6>7, –3156g>a, and –3279t>g). of all the variants, the ugt1a9 i399c>t was associated with the most dramatic change in sn-38-glucuronide (sn-38g) (2.64-fold; p = 0.0007). compared with ugt1a9 i399c/c, homozygous i399t/t presented elevated ugt1a1 and ugt1a9 proteins and higher glucuronidation of ugt1a9 and ugt1a1 substrates (p < 0.05). the very low linkage disequilibrium (r2 < 0.19) between ugt1a9 i399 and all the other ugt1a1 and ugt1a9 variants suggests a direct effect or linkage to unknown functional variant(s) relevant to sn-38 glucuronidation. the ugt1a9 –118t9/10 was also linked to alteration of sn-38 glucuronidation profiles in the liver (p < 0.05) and was associated with higher ugt1a1 protein (p = 0.03). however, ugt1a9 –118t10 appears to have low functional impact as a result of the lack of correlation with ugt1a9 protein levels and a modest 1.4-fold higher reporter gene expression associated with the –118t10 allele in hepg2 cells (p = 0.004). in contrast, the ugt1a9 –5366t, –4549c, –2152t, and –275a, associated with higher ugt1a9 protein (2-fold; p < 0.05), have no influence on sn-38g. despite limitations resulting from sample size, results indicate that ugt1a9 i399 and –118t9/10 may represent additional candidates in combination with ugt1a1 promoter haplotypes for the prediction of sn-38 glucuronidation profile in vivo.  the human udp-glucuronosyltransferase, ugt1a9, catalyses glucuronidations of various endobiotics and xenobiotics. in the present study, all exons, exon-intron junctions, and the 5'-flanking region (-273 bp) of the ugt1a9 gene in a japanese subject were sequenced. one base insertion of thymidine in a promoter region of the ugt1a9 gene resulting in a(t)10at was identified compared to the reference sequence of af297093 (a(t)9at). the allele was termed ugt1a9*22. a polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism method was developed to genotype the allele. the allele frequencies of the mutation in 87 japanese, 50 caucasian and 50 african-american subjects were 60%, 39% and 44%, respectively. the significance of the polymorphism was investigated by the construction of luciferase reporter plasmids containing 170 bp of the 5'-flanking region of the gene transfected into human hepatoma hepg2 cells. the luciferase activity of the promoter construct containing the a(t)10at sequence was 2.6-fold higher than that of the construct containing the a(t)9at sequence. in conclusion, the mutant allele with one base insertion in the promoter region of the ugt1a9 gene would alter the level of enzyme expression and the metabolism of those drugs that are substrates of ugt1a9.
proteasome inhibitors are able to efficiently induce apoptosis in many tumor cells while leaving quiescent, untransformed cells largely unharmed. here we investigated the further enhancement of proteasome inhibitor-mediated apoptosis induction in bcr-abl positive k562 cml cells by simultaneous treatment with different histone deacetylase inhibitors (hdis). combining proteasome and hdis resulted in rapid hyperacetylation of histone h3 and accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and the synergistic induction of apoptosis. apoptosis induction was associated with caspase 8, 3 and 9 activation, bid processing, destruction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, cleavage of parp and lamin b and extensive dna fragmentation. the pan-caspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk and the caspase-8 inhibitor z-ietd-fmk could inhibit k562 cell apoptosis. apoptosis was also delayed by overexpression of bcl-xl, as well as by crma, a known inhibitor of caspases 1 and 8. caspase 8 activity could still be detected in the presence of ectopic bcl-xl, but not in crma transfected cells. the most striking anti-apoptotic effect though was obtained by the translational inhibitor cycloheximide, which abolished caspase 8 processing, blocked bid cleavage and maintained the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. apoptosis by the combination treatment occurred independently from cd95/fas receptor stimulation. these results demonstrated that transcriptional activation by hdis combined with proteasome inhibitor mediated posttranslational stabilization of protein(s) results in significantly enhanced cml apoptosis which was striktly dependent on uninterrupted protein synthesis.  the targeted degradation of key regulatory proteins is an essential element of cell cycle control. the proteasome plays a central role in the degradation of such proteins and has therefore become an important therapeutic target for diseases involving cell proliferation, notably cancer. this review summarizes numerous studies demonstrating that proteasome inhibition induces apoptosis and sensitizes cancer cells to traditional tumoricidal agents both in vitro and in vivo. the potent and selective proteasome inhibitor, ps-341, is particularly promising from a therapeutic perspective, and it is the only such inhibitor that has progressed to clinical trials. preliminary data indicate that the drug is well tolerated by patients with cancer, and further trials are underway to assess the safety and efficacy of proteasome inhibition in hematologic and solid tumors, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other chemotherapeutics.
in this paper, we investigate the use of some well-known versions of particle swarm optimization (pso): the canonical pso with gbest model and lbest model with ring topology, the bare bones pso (bbpso) and the fully informed particle swarm (fips) on noisy optimization problems. as far as we know, some of these versions like bbpso and fips had not been previously applied to noisy functions yet. a hybrid approach which consists of the swarm algorithms combined with a jump strategy has been developed for static environments. here, we focus on investigating the introduction of the jump strategy to the swarm algorithms now applied to noisy optimization problems. the hybrid approach is compared experimentally on different noisy benchmark functions. simulation results indicate that the addition of the jump strategy to the swarm algorithms is beneficial in terms of robustness.  particle swarm optimization has become a common heuristic technique in the optimization community, with many researchers exploring the concepts, issues, and applications of the algorithm. in spite of this attention, there has as yet been no standard definition representing exactly what is involved in modern implementations of the technique. a standard is defined here which is designed to be a straightforward extension of the original algorithm while taking into account more recent developments that can be expected to improve performance on standard measures. this standard algorithm is intended for use both as a baseline for performance testing of improvements to the technique, as well as to represent pso to the wider optimization community
background despite the large number of treatments available for bipolar disorder (bd), more than one half of patients have a recurrence within 2 years, and over 90% experience at least one additional affective episode during their lifetime.   methods the aim of this study was to test the impact of a number of demographic and clinical features on the risk to recurrence in a real- word representative sample of 266 outpatients with bd-i or ii treated in a naturalistic setting during a 4-years-follow-up period.   results we found that the number of episodes per year after study entry, compared to the number of episodes per year before study entry,significantly decreased and that about one third of patients had no recurrences during the observation period. the length of follow-up and the number of previous episodes, mainly depressive, predicted the risk of recurrence, while female gender, higher age at intake, and a higher frequency of past mixed episodes predicted a higher frequency of recurrences.   limitations the study had some limitations to consider: i.e. the risk of poor reliability of information on the previous course of illness or the naturalistic treatment during the follow-up.   conclusions our study suggests that (a) an evidence-based long-term treatment, with regular follow-up visits could improve the course of disease and prognosis; (b) clinicians should carefully consider the presence of a high number of mixed episodes, to provide more targeted treatment strategies; (c) an appropriate use of antidepressants in selected patients did not worsen the course of illness.  backgroundfew studies of the time to remission and first relapse in severe bipolar disorder have been based on epidemiologically defined samples or have examined patient characteristics and time-varying indicators of medication use simultaneously. using a cohort from the suffolk county mental health project, we describe these temporal patterns and their relationships with childhood, illness, and treatment characteristics.methoda multi-facility cohort of 123 first-admission inpatients with dsm-iv bipolar disorder with psychotic features was followed for 4 years. dates of the first complete remission (lasting at least 2 months), subsequent relapses, and use of antimanic (am),antipsychotic (ap), and antidepressant (ad) medications were recorded. childhood and illness characteristics were ascertained at baseline using standard instruments.resultsby the 4-year point, 83.7% had achieved a full remission, with 42.3% remitting within 3 months, 63.4% within 6 months, and 74.8% within 1 year. overall, younger age of onset, history of childhood psychopathology, and higher brief psychiatric rating scale (bprs) anxiety/depression scores were significantly associated with longer time to remission. discontinuing am, ap and ad (compared to never using) and taking ap and ad (compared to never using) were significantly associated with remission in the multivariate analysis. of the 103 participants with complete remission, 61.2% suffered a relapse; 24.3 % relapsed within 6 months of remission, and 35.9% within a year. overall, 32.5% of the 123 participants had a single episode followed by full remission. childhood internalizing-type problems, higher bprs anxiety/depression and hamilton depression scores, and an admission episode not involving mania, but not patterns of medication use, were associated with shorter time to relapse.conclusionby 4-year follow-up, the majority of severely ill bipolar patients had remitted from their initial episode, but more than half subsequently relapsed. illness characteristics, especially depressive symptoms, and medication treatment were associated with the early course, although medication use after remission was not associated with relapse.
backgroundtransforming growth factor beta (tgfβ) signalling is involved in both tumour suppression and tumour progression. the mrna expression levels of the tgfβ isoforms and receptors in breast tumours may have prognostic value and clinical implications.methodsthe mrna levels of tgfb1, tgfb2, tgfb3, tgfbr1 and tgfbr2 were analysed in primary breast tumours and adjacent normal breast tissues, and the associations with tumour characteristics and patients’ overall and relapse-free survival were evaluated, using the public gene expression microarray data from the cancer genome atlas (n = 520) and the gene expression omnibus (four datasets) and our quantitative real-time pcr validation data (n = 71).resultssignificantly higher tgfb1 and tgfb3 mrna levels and lower tgfbr2 mrna levels were observed in primary tumours compared with their paired normal tissues. tgfb1 mrna expression was seemly lower in triple-negative tumours and in tumours from lymph node-negative patients. tgfb3 mrna expression was significantly lower in estrogen receptor-negative/progesterone receptor-negative/basal-like/grade 3 tumours. high tgfb2, tgfb3 and tgfbr2 mrna levels in tumours were generally associated with better prognosis for patients, especially those diagnosed with lymph node-negative diseases. high tgfbr1 mrna levels in tumours were associated with poorer clinical outcomes for patients diagnosed with small (diameter ≤2 cm) tumours.conclusionsthe results indicate a reduced responsiveness of tumour cells to tgfβ, a preferential up-regulation of tgfb1 in malignant tumours and a preferential up-regulation of tgfb3 in premalignant tumours. the results may not only provide prognostic value for patients but also assist in classifying tumours according to their potential responses to tgfβ and selecting patients for tgfβ signalling pathway targeted therapies.  background genome-wide measures of gene expression can identify patterns of gene activity that subclassify tumours and might provide a better means than is currently available for individual risk assessment in patients with lymph-node-negative breast cancer.   methods we analysed, with affymetrix human u133a genechips, the expression of 22000 transcripts from total rna of frozen tumour samples from 286 lymph-node-negative patients who had not received adjuvant systemic treatment.   findings in a training set of 115 tumours, we identified a 76-gene signature consisting of 60 genes for patients positive for oestrogen receptors (er) and 16 genes for er-negative patients. this signature showed 93% sensitivity and 48% specificity in a subsequent independent testing set of 171 lymph-node-negative patients. the gene profile was highly informative in identifying patients who developed distant metastases within 5 years (hazard ratio 5.67 [95% ci 2.59-12.4]), even when corrected for traditional prognostic factors in multivariate analysis (5.55 [2.46-12.5]). the 76-gene profile also represented a strong prognostic factor for the development of metastasis in the subgroups of 84 premenopausal patients (9.60 [2.28-40.5]), 87 postmenopausal patients (4.04 [1.57-10.4]), and 79 patients with tumours of 10-20 mm (14.1 [3.34-59.2]), a group of patients for whom prediction of prognosis is especially difficult.   interpretation the identified signature provides a powerful tool for identification of patients at high risk of distant recurrence. the ability to identify patients who have a favourable prognosis could, after independent confirmation, allow clinicians to avoid adjuvant systemic therapy or to choose less aggressive therapeutic options.
peak force (pf), contractile rate of force development (rfd) and contractile impulse (ci) are of great importance to competitive weightlifters (wl). these athletes routinely perform successive bouts of high-intensity resistance exercise (hire) within the same day (double-day training) with the aim of improving muscular function and weightlifting performance. the purpose of this investigation was to determine and compare the pf, contractile rfd and ci responses to double-day training between wl and resistance trained (rt) adults (n = 16 per group). furthermore, we sought to establish whether acute changes in muscle function were associated with acute changes in muscle architecture. isometric front squat pf, contractile rfd, ci and the pennation angle (θp), anatomical and physiological thickness of the m. vastus lateralis (vl) were determined before and after two equivalent hire sessions separated by 4–6 h rest. each session consisted of ten single repetitions of the dynamic barbell front squat interspersed with 2-min rest, using a load equivalent to 90% of the pre-session pf. weightlifters demonstrated greater pf at all time points when compared to rt adults and exhibited no significant within or between session changes in pf, contractile rfd or ci. conversely, rt adults demonstrated within- and between-session decreases in pf and between-session increases in contractile rfd and ci. as no correlations were found between the relative within-session changes in muscle function and the concomitant changes in muscle architecture, other factors must contribute to the divergent responses in pf, contractile rfd and ci between wl and rt adults.  abstract‘explosive’ muscle strength or contractile rate of force development (rfd) is a term to describe the ability to rapidly develop muscular force, and can be measured as the slope of the torque–time curve obtained during isometric conditions. previously, conflicting results have been reported regarding the relationship between contractile rfd and various physiological parameters. one reason for this discrepancy may be that rfd in various time intervals from the onset of contraction is affected by different physiological parameters. the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between voluntary contractile rfd in time intervals of 0–10, 0–20,..., 0–250 ms from the onset of contraction and two main parameters: (1) voluntary maximal muscle strength and (2) electrically evoked muscle twitch contractile properties. the main finding was that voluntary rfd became increasingly more dependent on mvc and less dependent on muscle twitch contractile properties as time from the onset of contraction increased. at time intervals later than 90 ms from the onset of contraction maximal muscle strength could account for 52–81% of the variance in voluntary rfd. in the very early time interval (<40 ms from the onset of contraction) voluntary rfd was moderately correlated to the twitch contractile properties of the muscle and was to a less extent related to mvc. the present results suggest that explosive movements with different time spans are influenced by different physiological parameters. this may have important practical implications when designing resistance training programs for specific sports.
a number of studies suggest that the clinical manifestation of neurological deficits in hepatic encephalopathy results from pathologically synchronized neuronal oscillations and altered oscillatory coupling. in the present study spontaneous and evoked oscillatory brain activities were analyzed jointly with established behavioral measures of altered visual oscillatory processing. critical flicker and fusion frequencies (cff, fuf) were measured in 25 patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis and 30 healthy controls. magnetoencephalography (meg) data were collected at rest and during a visual task employing repetitive stimulation. resting meg and evoked fields were analyzed. cff and fuf were found to be reduced in patients, providing behavioral evidence for deficits in visual oscillatory processing. these alterations were found to be related to resting brain activity in patients, namely that the lower the dominant meg frequency at rest, the lower the cff and fuf. an analysis of evoked fields at sensor level indicated that in comparison to normal controls, patients were not able to dynamically adapt to flickering visual stimulation. evoked activity was also analyzed based on independent components (ics) derived by independent component analysis. the similarity between the shape of each ic and an artificial sine function representing the stimulation frequency was tested via magnitude squared coherence. in controls, we observed a small number of components that correlated strongly with the sine function and a high number of ics that did not correlate with the sine function. interestingly, patient data were characterized by a high number of moderately correlating components. taken together, these results indicate a fundamental divergence of the cerebral resonance activity in cirrhotic patients.  objective hepatic encephalopathy (he) is characterized by neuropsychological and motor deficits. the present study tested the hypothesis that worsening of motor and sensory symptoms of he results from a common basic deficit in the cerebral oscillatory processing within the human motor and visual system.   methods we investigated in 32 patients with liver cirrhosis and he grades 0-2 critical flicker frequency (cff) and cortico-muscular (m1-emg) coherence as a measure of coupling between the surface emgs of hand muscles and primary motor cortex (m1) activity recorded non-invasively with magnetoencephalography (meg) during forearm elevation.   results patients with he-grade 2 developed excessive m1-emg coherence at low frequencies. in contrast, maximum m1-emg coherence in patients with no he showed frequency and amplitude in the physiological range. cff was continuously reduced with worsening grades of he. correlation analysis revealed significant correlation between the frequency of m1-emg coherence and cff.   conclusions taken together, we demonstrate that increased grades of he lead to a pathological m1-emg drive which is reduced in frequency. these effects are correlated with an impaired perception of oscillatory visual stimuli.   significance the results suggest that pathological oscillatory neural processing in different human cerebral systems may represent a basic mechanism for the clinical manifestation of he.
the opening of stomata, which is driven by the accumulation of k+ salt in guard cells, is induced by blue light (bl). the bl activates the h+ pump; however, the mechanism by which the perception of bl is transduced into the pump activation remains unknown. we present evidence that the pump is the plasma membrane h+‐atpase and that bl activates the h+‐atpase via phosphorylation. a pulse of bl (30 s, 100 μmol/m2/s) increased atp hydrolysis by the plasma membrane h+‐atpase and h+ pumping in vicia guard cell protoplasts with a similar time course. the h+‐atpase was phosphorylated reversibly by bl, and the phosphorylation levels paralleled the atp hydrolytic activity. the phosphorylation occurred exclusively in the c‐termini of h+‐atpases on both serine and threonine residues in two isoproteins of h+‐atpase in guard cells. an endogenous 14‐3‐3 protein was co‐precipitated with h+‐atpase, and the recombinant 14‐3‐3 protein bound to the phosphorylated c‐termini of h+‐atpases. these findings demonstrate that bl activates the plasma membrane h+‐atpase via phosphorylation of the c‐terminus by a serine/threonine protein kinase, and that the 14‐3‐3 protein has a key role in the activation.  but is it an elephant? in the old tale, several blind men are taken to an elephant. in turn, each is asked to examine and identify the mystery object. one blind man examines a leg and claims it to be a tree, another, examining the trunk, claims it to be a snake, and yet another, feeling a tusk, claims it to be a smooth rock. the pattern continues: each describes a component, none identifies the gestalt. there are a wealth of blue-light responses in higher plants. it is clear that many are biochemically, physiologically, or genetically independent, and others are linked. the mechanism by which a photon of blue light is converted into a biochemical signal and transduced into a biological response is under investigation for several of these responses. in many cases, investigators have successfully defined one or more components of the signaling mechanism. taken together, the identified components have the potentia1 to define an entire signal transduction mechanism; receptor, g-protein, diacylglycerol, inositol triphosphate, calcium, calmodulin, several kinases, ion channels, and so forth. however, direct demonstration of a11 the components has not been achieved in any one system. indeed, in some cases specific carriers are known to be absent. further, the locations of the respective carriers differ in accordance with the location of the specific response (fig. l). perhaps the mechanisms responsible for transducing the blue-light signals are best represented by a herd of elephants. signal transduction paradigms are well established. however, recent data suggest that plants may have several nove1 signal carriers (deng et al., 1992), and it is not certain that the paradigms will be transferable to plants. the majority of studies of signal carriers for blue-light responses in higher plants make use of standard biochemical tools: direct identification based on biochemical properties or antibody crossreactivity, or indirect identification based on inhibitor/activator studies. these biochemical activities are correlated with the respective blue-light response by the photobiological activity (fluence response and/or time course), physical location, or involvement with the response as demonstrated by activator/inhibitor studies. the biochemical approach has recently been joined by a vigorous genetic approach. there are four blue-light responses in higher plants cur' supported in part by the national science foundation and the
we discuss the geometric engineering and large n transition for an = 1 u(n) chiral gauge theory with one adjoint, one conjugate symmetric, one antisymmetric and eight fundamental chiral multiplets. our iib realization involves an orientifold of a non-compact calabi-yau a2 fibration, together with d5-branes wrapping the exceptional curves of its resolution as well as the orientifold fixed locus. we give a detailed discussion of this background and of its relation to the hanany-witten realization of the same theory. in particular, we argue that the t-duality relating the two constructions maps the 2 orientifold of the hanany-witten realization into a 4 orientifold in type iib. we also discuss the related engineering of theories with so/sp gauge groups and symmetric or antisymmetric matter.  abstract we discuss some aspects of the physics of branes in the presence of orientifolds and the corresponding world-volume gauge dynamics. we show that at strong coupling orientifolds sometimes turn into bound states of orientifolds and branes, and give a world-sheet argument for the flip of the sign of an orientifold plane split into two disconnected parts by an ns5-brane. we also describe the moduli space of vacua of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories with symplectic and orthogonal gauge groups, and analyze a set of four-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories with chiral matter content using branes.
motivation over the past 30 years, within the field of infrastructure management, as infrastructure systems have grown more complex, the level of managerial and financial oversight has increased, and the computation power has become less expensive and more readily available, infrastructure managers have increasingly turned to computerized infrastructure management systems to aid in the management of the built infrastructure. an infrastructure management system acts as an infrastructure manager's 1) inspection database detailing the current state of the built infrastructure, 2) infrastructure performance simulation platform modeling the potential future infrastructure performance, 3) infrastructure deterioration and provided service estimator evaluating the equivalent financial loss associated with infrastructure deterioration and decreased provided levels of service, and 4) infrastructure maintenance action development engine formulating and scheduling technically and financially optimal infrastructure maintenance solutions. historically, the performance simulation module of infrastructure management systems has focused primarily upon modeling gradual infrastructure deterioration processes, such as corrosion, and the infrastructure provided service estimator has employed nominal values for quantifying the public's evaluation of the provided infrastructure performance. these approaches have caused infrastructure managers to focus their attention and funding towards combating gradual infrastructure deterioration while giving priority maintenance status to infrastructure objects that place the largest nominally evaluated total performance impact on society. while this approach has helped infrastructure managers to more efficiently manage the built infrastructure, such an approach is only efficient if it is unfailingly implemented over multiple decades. unfortunately, the current limited infrastructure management system scope has exposed infrastructure managers to two potentially disruptive forces – potential unforeseen natural hazard induced technical failures and potential political and/or financial funding support failures due to incongruent evaluation of the provided level of performance between the infrastructure manager's nominal evaluation measures and the experiencing society. while these two disruptive forces originate in two very different elements of an infrastructure management system, they both can induce the same result – undermining of the intended technically and financially optimal infrastructure management solution. objective and originality to work towards rectifying both of these limitations, the current work has developed methodologies for both quantifying the long-term infrastructure natural hazard risk exposure and estimating an individual's experience-based evaluation of the provided level of infrastructure performance. the methodology for assessing natural hazard induced technical infrastructure failures has focused around developing an infrastructure component potential failure assessment procedure which employs data within existing infrastructure and transportation management systems and currently under development natural hazard identification maps. this failure assessment procedure is designed to identify the locations and estimate the associated consequences of potential natural hazard induced failures. this failure probability and failure consequence information is then employed to quantify an annualized and a multi-year infrastructure link risk exposure. the methodology for estimating an individual's experience-based evaluation of the provided level of infrastructure performance has been developed by employing research findings from the fields of psychology and behavioral economics to develop the affective assessment approach, a variance-based evaluation tool. this evaluation tool employs an individual's range and quality of experienced infrastructure performance in time to predict the individual's current induced affect and future sensitivity to the provided levels of infrastructure performance. as this is a constructed evaluation approach, employing the affective assessment approach directly in the third infrastructure management module, evaluating equivalent financial loss associated with decreased provided levels of service, can be computationally prohibitive as each potential sequence would need to be modeled. it is, therefore, proposed to use the affective assessment approach as a reality check against which the developed technically and financially optimal management solution can be assessed and solutions which provide too low or inconsistent levels of infrastructure performance can be identified, reevaluated or discarded. results and benefits with this additional technical information and perspectives, infrastructure managers are able to actively consider an object's natural hazard risk exposure in modeling the infrastructure deterioration and in developing optimal maintenance actions. furthermore, infrastructure managers are able to determine the annual funding that should be invested and made available to respond to current and future natural hazard induced object failures. by, calibrating and implanting the affective assessment approach, infrastructure managers can also study how proposed technically optimal solutions may be socially received and can select solutions which best maintain social support throughout the duration of the maintenance solution. within the field of infrastructure management, the past 30 years has been invested in developing standardized and computerized infrastructure management systems. with these systems implemented, infrastructure managers are starting to observe their strengths but also their limitations. this work has focused on formulating quantitative methods to develop solutions for two of these limitations. it is hoped that these methods might be further developed, calibrated and implemented to improve existing infrastructure management systems and the infrastructure and society they manage.  a fundamental requirement for effectively monitoring and operating transportation facilities is reliable, accurate data on traffic flow. the current state of the practice is to use networks of point detectors to gather information on traffic flow at fixed points on the roadway network. traffic monitoring based on wireless location technology (wlt) offers an opportunity to expand the size of the transportation network being monitored at a lower cost than with point detection. in wlt-based monitoring, the locations of individual wireless devices are sampled anonymously. by tracking a series of positions for devices in vehicles, it is theoretically possible to estimate the average travel speed on a road. although the concept of wlt-based monitoring is attractive, results have been mixed. field tests have been successful at locating vehicle positions but have not been able to generate traffic information of the quality or reliability required for most applications. this research explored how wlt-based monitoring could be improved by rigorously examining the problem from a system design perspective. the evaluation focused on two measures of effectiveness: (1) the availability of speed estimates and (2) the accuracy of speed estimates. the performance of wlt-based monitoring systems was evaluated through a combination of controlled testing on simple networks and case studies on simulated real-world networks. significant main effects and interactions were evaluated in a systematic manner using a test bed that combined microscopic traffic simulation and a model of a wlt-based monitoring system. the results revealed several important issues to be considered when designing and implementing a wlt-based monitoring system. the selection of parameters such as the number of vehicles tracked and frequency between readings needs to be tailored to handle localized traffic and geometric conditions. the results showed that well-designed monitoring systems could produce accurate results although there were some situations where performance could be improved. guidelines for the design and use of wlt-based systems were generated, and future avenues to improve system performance were noted.
abstract overgeneral autobiographical memory (abm) disclosure has been established as a key cognitive marker of clinical depression in experimental research studies. to determine the ecological validity of these findings for psychotherapy treatments of depression, the present study investigated the relationship between change in level of depression and abm specificity in the context of early, middle, and late therapy session transcripts selected from 34 clients undergoing emotion-focused therapy and client-centered therapy in the york i depression study. a hierarchical linear modeling analysis demonstrated that clients disclosed significantly more specific abms over the course of therapy. there were no differences in abm specificity between treatment groups. there was also no evidence that increased specificity differentiated between recovered and unchanged clients at treatment termination.  previous research on depressed and suicidal patients and those with posttraumatic stress disorder has shown that patients' memory for the past is overgeneral (i.e., patients retrieve generic summaries of past events rather than specific events). this study investigated whether autobiographical memory could be affected by psychological treatment. recovered depressed patients were randomly allocated to receive either treatment as usual or treatment designed to reduce risk of relapse. whereas control patients showed no change in specificity of memories recalled in response to cue words, the treatment group showed a significantly reduced number of generic memories. although such a memory deficit may arise from long-standing tendencies to encode and retrieve events generically, such a style is open to modification.
early‐onset bipolar (bp) disorder and other poor prognosis characteristics are more prevalent in patients from the united states than from the netherlands and germany (abbreviated as europe). we explored the impact of parental loading for affective illness on onset and other characteristics of bp disorder.  objective: to compare the prevalence rates of mental disorders among children of parents with bipolar disorder and of parents with no mental disorders. method: seventeen studies, meeting specific selection criteria, were included in the metaanalyses. risks for mental disorders among children were estimated by aggregating raw data from the selected studies. results: results indicate that in comparison with children of parents with no mental disorders, children of parents with bipolar disorder are 2.7 times more likely to develop any mental disorder and 4.0 times more likely to develop an affective disorder. the metaanalyses indicate that during childhood and adolescence, the risks for any mental disorder and for affective disorders in children are consistently but moderately related to having a parent who suffers from bipolar disorder. conclusions: risk factors that could account for the psychopathology observed in children of bipolar parents are explored.
abstractwhile it is known that certain pathologies may impact on left–right symmetry of gait, little is known about the mechanisms that contribute to gait symmetry or how high in the hierarchy of the control of gait symmetry is regulated in humans. to assess the contribution of cognitive function to gait symmetry, we measured gait asymmetry (ga) in three subject groups, patients with parkinson’s disease (pd, n = 21), idiopathic elderly fallers (n = 15), and healthy elderly controls (n = 11). all subjects walked under two walking conditions: usual walking and dual tasking (cognitive loading) condition. for each subject, the swing time (sw) was calculated and averaged across strides for the left and right feet (swl and swr). ga was defined as:   $$ 100 \times {\left| {\ln ({\text{swr}}/{\text{swl}})} \right|.} $$ for both the pd patients and the elderly fallers ga values were significantly higher during the usual walking condition, as compared with the control group (p < 0.01). in addition, for both the pd patients and the elderly fallers, ga significantly increased when they walked and performed a dual task, compared with the usual walking condition (p < 0.003). in contrast, dual tasking did not affect the ga of the healthy controls (p = 0.518). ga was associated with gait speed and gait variability, but no correlations were found between ga and the asymmetry of the classic pd motor symptoms. thus, the results suggest that the ability to generate a steady, rhythmic walk with a bilaterally coordinated gait does not rely heavily on mental attention and cognitive resources in healthy older adults. in contrast, however, when gait becomes impaired and less automatic, ga apparently relies on cognitive input and attention.  cognitive function and the performance of a secondary, dual task may affect certain aspects of gait, but the relationships between cognitive function and gait are not well understood. to better understand the motor control of gait and the relationship between cognitive function and gait, we studied cognitive function and the effects of different types of dual tasking on the gait of patients with parkinson's disease (pd) and controls, contrasting measures of gait automaticity and rhythmicity with other features. patients with idiopathic pd (n = 30; mean age 71.8 year) with moderate disease severity (hoehn and yahr stage 2–3) were compared to age and gender‐matched healthy controls (n = 28). memory and executive function were also assessed. in both groups, gait speed decreased in response to dual tasking, in a parallel fashion. for the pd group only, gait variability increased compared to usual walking. executive function was significantly worse in the pd group, while memory was not different in the two groups. executive function measures were significantly correlated with gait variability during dual tasking, but not during usual walking. these findings demonstrate that regulation of gait variability and rhythmicity is apparently an automatic process that does not demand attention in healthy adults. in patients with pd, however, this ability becomes attention‐demanding and worsens when subjects perform secondary tasks. moreover, the associations between executive function and gait variability suggest that a decline in executive function in pd may exacerbate the effects of dual tasking on gait, potentially increasing fall risk.
melanoma commonly clusters in families, and the recent identification of numerous genotypes predicting higher risks of melanoma has led to the widespread perception that this cancer is predominantly a genetic disease. we conducted a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis to quantify the contribution of familial factors to melanoma, estimated by the population attributable fraction (paf). eligible studies were those that permitted quantitative assessment of the association between histologically confirmed melanoma and family history of the disease; we identified 22 such studies using citation databases, followed by manual review of retrieved references. we calculated summary rrs using weighted averages of the log rr, taking into account random effects, and used these to estimate the paf. overall, family history was associated with a significant 2-fold increased risk of melanoma (odds ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.72-2.45); however, there was significant heterogeneity (p = 0.01). the pooled estimate for population-based studies (n = 11) was 2.03 (1.70-2.43), and 2.51 (1.55-4.07) for clinic/hospital-based studies (n = 11), both with significant heterogeneity (p = 0.049 and p = 0.013, respectively). two studies used record linkage to verify family history in relatives; the pooled risk estimate from these two studies was 2.52 (2.11-3.00) with no evidence of heterogeneity (p = 0.258). estimates of paf associated with a positive family history ranged from 0.007 for northern europe to 0.064 for australia (0.040 for all regions combined). our findings suggest that only a small percentage of melanoma cases (always <7%) are attributable to familial risk; the majority of melanomas are presumably attributable to other factors. cancer epidemiol biomarkers prev; 19(1); 65–73  to assess whether screening people at high risk of malignant melanoma would be effective in reducing the mortality from the disease data from 400 case-control pairs in a study of cutaneous malignant melanoma conducted in western australia during 1980-1 were used to predict the risk of melanoma in the remaining 111 pairs. all variables previously shown to be associated with a decrease or increase in the incidence of melanoma were considered for inclusion in a single conditional logistic regression model of the incidence of melanoma in the randomly chosen subset of 400 case-control pairs. five of these variables--number of raised naevi on the arms, arrival in australia before 10 years of age, history of non-melanocytic skin cancer, time spent outdoors in summer from the age of 10 to 24, and family history of melanoma--provided good discrimination between patients and controls in this sample and the 111 other case-control pairs. among the 222 subjects in these other case-control pairs a group defined as being at high risk of melanoma by a risk score derived from these five variables contained 60 (54%) of the patients with melanoma but only 18 (16%) of the controls. these data suggest that in western australia more than half of all new patients with melanoma arise in an identifiable subpopulation constituting less than one fifth of the whole population. identifying this subpopulation and screening it regularly for cutaneous malignant melanoma could be cost effective in reducing mortality from this disease.
in this thesis, we study methods to leverage information from fully-structured knowledge bases  (kbs), in particular the encyclopedic knowledge graph (kg) dbpedia, for different text-related  tasks from the area of information retrieval (ir) and natural language processing (nlp). the  key idea is to apply entity linking (el) methods that identify mentions of kb entities in text,  and then exploit the structured information within kgs. developing entity-centric methods for  text understanding using kg exploration is the focus of this work.    we aim to show that structured background knowledge is a means for improving performance in  different ir and nlp tasks that traditionally only make use of the unstructured text input itself.  thereby, the kb entities mentioned in text act as connection between the unstructured text and  the structured kg. we focus in particular on how to best leverage the knowledge as contained in  such fully-structured (rdf) kgs like dbpedia with their labeled edges/predicates – which is in  contrast to previous work on wikipedia-based approaches we build upon, which typically relies  on unlabeled graphs only. the contribution of this thesis can be structured along its three parts:    in part i, we apply el and semantify short text snippets with kb entities. while only retrieving  types and categories from dbpedia for each entity, we are able to leverage this information  to create semantically coherent clusters of text snippets. this pipeline of connecting text to  background knowledge via the mentioned entities will be reused in all following chapters.    in part ii, we focus on semantic similarity and extend the idea of semantifying text with entities  by proposing in chapter 5 a model that represents whole documents by their entities. in this  model, comparing documents semantically with each other is viewed as the task of comparing  the semantic relatedness of the respective entities, which we address in chapter 4. we propose  an unsupervised graph weighting schema and show that weighting the dbpedia kg leads to  better results on an existing entity ranking dataset. the exploration of weighted kg paths turns  out to be also useful when trying to disambiguate the entities from an open information extraction  (oie) system in chapter 6. with this weighting schema, the integration of kg information  for computing semantic document similarity in chapter 5 becomes the task of comparing the two  kg subgraphs with each other, which we address by an approximate subgraph matching. based  on a well-established evaluation dataset for semantic document similarity, we show that our unsupervised  method achieves competitive performance similar to other state-of-the-art methods.  our results from this part indicate that kgs can contain helpful background knowledge, in particular  when exploring kg paths, but that selecting the relevant parts of the graph is an important  yet difficult challenge.    in part iii, we shift to the task of relevance ranking and first study in chapter 7 how to best  retrieve kb entities for a given keyword query. combining again text with kb information, we  extract entities from the top-k retrieved, query-specific documents and then link the documents  to two different kbs, namely wikipedia and dbpedia. in a learning-to-rank setting, we study  extensively which features from the text, thewikipedia kb, and the dbpedia kg can be helpful  for ranking entities with respect to the query. experimental results on two datasets, which build  upon existing trec document retrieval collections, indicate that the document-based mention  frequency of an entity and the wikipedia-based query-to-entity similarity are both important  features for ranking. the kg paths in contrast play only a minor role in this setting, even when  integrated with a semantic kernel extension. in chapter 8, we further extend the integration of  query-specific text documents and kg information, by extracting not only entities, but also relations  from text. in this exploratory study based on a self-created relevance dataset, we find that  not all extracted relations are relevant with respect to the query, but that they often contain information  not contained within the dbpedia kg. the main insight from the research presented in  this part is that in a query-specific setting, established ir methods for document retrieval provide  an important source of information even for entity-centric tasks, and that a close integration of  relevant text document and background knowledge is promising.    finally, in the concluding chapter we argue that future research should further address the integration  of kg information with entities and relations extracted from (specific) text documents,  as their potential seems to be not fully explored yet. the same holds also true for a better kg  exploration, which has gained some scientific interest in recent years. it seems to us that both aspects  will remain interesting problems in the next years, also because of the growing importance  of kgs for web search and knowledge modeling in industry and academia.  an

ments presents a significant theoretical challenge for cognitive science, with ready-made applications in in- formation handling and decision support systems deal- ing with text. while a number of candidate models exist, they have generally not been assessed in terms of their ability to emulate human judgments of simi- larity. to address this problem, we conducted an ex- periment that collected repeated similarity measures for each pair of documents in a small corpus of short news documents. an analysis of human performance showed inter-rater correlations of about 0.6. we then considered the ability of existing models—using word- based, n-gram and latent semantic analysis (lsa) approaches—to model these human judgments. the best performed lsa model produced correlations of about 0.6, consistent with human performance, while the best performed word-based and n-gram models achieved correlations closer to 0.5. many of the re- maining models showed almost no correlation with hu- man performance. based on our results, we provide some discussion of the key strengths and weaknesses of the models we examined. introduction modeling the semantic similarity between text docu- ments is an interesting problem for cognitive science, for both theoretical and practical reasons. theoret- ically, it involves the study of a basic cognitive pro- cess with richly structured natural stimuli. practically, search engines, text corpus visualizations, and a vari- ety of other applications for filtering, sorting, retriev- ing, and generally handling text rely fundamentally on similarity measures. for this reason, the ability to as- sess semantic similarity in an accurate, automated, and scalable way is a key determinant of the effectiveness of most information handling and decision support soft- ware that deals with text. a variety of different approaches have been devel- oped for modeling text document similarity. these in- clude simple word-based, keyword-based and n-gram measures (e.g., salton, 1989; damashek, 1995), and more complicated approaches such as latent seman- tic analysis (lsa: deerwester et al., 1990; landauer and dumais, 1997). while all of these approaches have achieved some level of practical success, they have gen- erally not been assessed in terms of their ability to model human judgments of text document similarity. the most likely reason for this failure is that no suit- able empirical data exist, and considerable effort is in- volved in collecting pairwise ratings of text document similarity for even a moderate number of documents. this paper reports the collection of data that give ten independent ratings of the similarity of every pair of 50 short text documents, and so represents an attempt to establish a ‘psychological ground truth’ for evaluating models. using the new data, we report a first eval- uation of the ability of word-based, n-gram and lsa approaches to model human judgments. experiment materials the text corpus evaluated by human judges contained 50 documents selected from the australian broadcast- ing corporation’s news mail service, which provides text e-mails of headline stories. the documents varied in length from 51 to 126 words, and covered a number of broad topics. a further 314 documents from the same were collected to act as a larger ‘backgrounding’ corpus for lsa. both document sets were assessed against a stan- dard corpus of five english texts using four models of language. these were the log-normal, generalized in- verse gauss-poisson (with γ = −0.5), yule-simon and zipfian models (baayen, 2001). both document sets were within the normal range of english text for word frequency spectrum and vocabulary growth and were therefore regarded as representative of normal english texts. subjects the subjects were 83 university of adelaide students (29 males and 54 females), with a mean age of 19.7 years. they were each paid with a ten (australian) dollar gift voucher for every 100 document pair ratings made.
in the present study we performed an integrated proteomics, interactomics and metabolomics analysis of longissimus dorsi tender and tough meat samples from chianina beef cattle. results were statistically handled as to obtain pearson's correlation coefficients of the results from omics investigation in relation to canonical tenderness-related parameters, including warner bratzler shear force, myofibrillar degradation (at 48 h and 10 days after slaughter), sarcomere length and total collagen content. as a result, we could observe that the tender meat group was characterized by higher levels of glycolytic enzymes, which were over-phosphorylated and produced accumulation of glycolytic intermediates. oxidative stress promoted meat tenderness and elicited heat shock protein responses, which in turn triggered apoptosis-like cascades along with parp fragmentation. phosphorylation was found to be a key process in post mortem muscle conversion to meat, as it was shown not only to modulate glycolytic enzyme activities, but also mediate the stability of structural proteins at the z-disk. on the other hand, phosphorylation of hsps has been supposed to alter their functions through changing their affinity for target interactors. analogies and breed-specific differences are highlighted throughout the text via a direct comparison of the present results against the ones obtained in a parallel study on maremmana longissimus dorsi. it emerges that, while the main cornerstones and the final outcome are maintained, post mortem metabolism in tender and tough meat yielding individuals is subtly modulated via specific higher levels of enzymes and amino acidic residue phosphorylation in a breed-specific fashion, and whether calcium homeostasis dysregulation was a key factor in maremmana, higher early post mortem phosphocreatine levels in the chianina tender group could favor a slower and prolonged glycolytic rate, prolonging the extent of the minimum hanging period necessary to obtain tender meat from this breed by a few days.  within a population of charolais young bulls, two extreme groups of longissimus thoracis muscle samples, classified according to warner-bratzler shear force (wbsf) of 55 degrees c grilled meat, were analyzed by 2d-electrophoresis. muscle analyses were performed on 4 bulls of the "tender" group (wbsf=27.7+/-4.8 n) and 4 bulls of the "tough" group (wbsf=41.2+/-6.1 n), at 3 post-mortem times: d0, samples taken within 10 min post-mortem; d5 and d21, samples kept at 4 degrees c under vacuum during 5 and 21 days. proteins of muscle samples were separated in two fractions based on protein solubility in tris buffer: "soluble" and "insoluble". proteins of both fractions were separated by 2d-electrophoresis. evolution of spots during the 3 post-mortem times was analyzed by hierarchical classification (hca). three clusters of proteins presenting similar evolution profiles provided accurate classification of post-mortem times and showed the translocation of some chaperone proteins and glycolytic enzymes from the soluble fraction to the insoluble fraction between d0 and d5. cellular structure dismantlement and proteolysis was observed at d21. effect of group ("tender" vs "tough") on spot intensities was tested by anova. at d0, higher quantity of proteins of the inner and outer membrane of mitochondria was found in the tender group suggesting a more extensive degradation of mitochondria that may be related to the apoptotic process.
neurons develop highly stereotyped receptive fields by coordinated growth of their dendrites. although cell surface cues play a major role in this process, few dendrite specific signals have been identified to date. we conducted an in vivo rnai screen in drosophila class iv dendritic arborization (c4da) neurons and identified the conserved ret receptor, known to play a role in axon guidance, as an important regulator of dendrite development. the loss of ret results in severe dendrite defects due to loss of extracellular matrix adhesion, thus impairing growth within a 2d plane. we provide evidence that ret interacts with integrins to regulate dendrite adhesion via rac1. in addition, ret is required for dendrite stability and normal f-actin distribution suggesting it has an essential role in dendrite maintenance. we propose novel functions for ret as a regulator in dendrite patterning and adhesion distinct from its role in axon guidance. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.05491.001  alternative splicing of the drosophila gene dscam results in up to 38,016 different receptor isoforms proposed to interact by isoform-specific homophilic binding. we report that dscam controls cell-intrinsic aspects of dendrite guidance in all four classes of dendrite arborization (da) neurons. loss of dscam in single neurons causes a strong increase in self-crossing. restriction of dendritic fields of neighboring class iii neurons appeared intact in mutant neurons, suggesting that dendritic self-avoidance, but not heteroneuronal tiling, may depend on dscam. overexpression of the same dscam isoforms in two da neurons with overlapping dendritic fields forced a spatial segregation of the two fields, supporting the model that dendritic branches of da neurons use isoform-specific homophilic interactions to ensure minimal overlap. homophilic binding of the highly diverse extracellular domains of dscam may therefore limit the use of the same "core" repulsion mechanism to cell-intrinsic interactions without interfering with heteroneuronal interactions.
the vertebral column is a conserved anatomical structure that defines the vertebrate phylum. the periodic or segmental pattern of the vertebral column is established early in development when the vertebral precursors, the somites, are rhythmically produced from presomitic mesoderm (psm). this rhythmic activity is controlled by a segmentation clock that is associated with the periodic transcription of cyclic genes in the psm. comparison of the mouse, chicken and zebrafish psm oscillatory transcriptomes revealed networks of 40 to 100 cyclic genes mostly involved in notch, wnt and fgf signaling pathways. however, despite this conserved signaling oscillation, the identity of individual cyclic genes mostly differed between the three species, indicating a surprising evolutionary plasticity of the segmentation networks.  background the pattern of somites is traced out by a mechanism involving oscillating gene expression at the tail end of the embryo. in zebrafish, two linked oscillating genes, her1 and her7, coding for inhibitory gene regulatory proteins, are especially implicated in genesis of the oscillations, while notch signaling appears necessary for synchronization of adjacent cells.   results i show by mathematical simulation that direct autorepression of her1 and her7 by their own protein products provides a mechanism for the intracellular oscillator. this mechanism operates robustly even when one allows for the fact that gene regulation is an essentially noisy (stochastic) process. the predicted period is close to the observed period (30 min) and is dictated primarily by the transcriptional delay, the time taken to make an mrna molecule. through its coupling to her1/her7 expression, notch signaling can keep the rapid oscillations in adjacent cells synchronized. when the coupling parameters are varied, however, the model system can switch to oscillations of a much longer period, resembling that of the mouse or chick somitogenesis oscillator and governed by the delays in the notch pathway. such notch-mediated synchronous oscillations are predicted even in the absence of direct her1/her7 autoregulation, through operation of the standard notch signaling pathway that is usually assumed simply to give lateral inhibition.   conclusions direct autorepression of a gene by its own product can generate oscillations, with a period determined by the transcriptional and translational delays. simple as they are, such systems show surprising behaviors. to understand them, unaided intuition is not enough: we need mathematics.
the objective of foreground segmentation is to extract the desired foreground object from input videos. over the years there have been significant amount of efforts on this topic, nevertheless there still lacks a simple yet effective algorithm that can process live videos of objects with fuzzy boundaries captured by freely moving cameras. this paper presents an algorithm toward this goal. the key idea is to train and maintain two competing one-class support vector machines (1svms) at each pixel location, which model local color distributions for foreground and background, respectively. we advocate the usage of two competing local classifiers, as it provides higher discriminative power and allows better handling of ambiguities. as a result, our algorithm can deal with a variety of videos with complex backgrounds and freely moving cameras with minimum user interactions. in addition, by introducing novel acceleration techniques and by exploiting the parallel structure of the algorithm, realtime processing speed is achieved for vga-sized videos.  this paper examines the problem of moving object detection. more precisely, it addresses the difficult scenarios where background scene textures in the video might change over time. in this paper, we formulate the problem mathematically as minimizing a constrained risk functional motivated from the large margin principle. it is a generalization of the one class support vector machines (1-svms) [17] to accommodate spatial interactions, which is further incorporated into an online learning framework to track temporal changes. as a result it yields a closed-form update formula, a central component of the proposed algorithm to enable prompt adaptation to spatio-temporal changes. we also analyze the mistake bound and discuss issues such as dealing with non-stationary distributions, making use of kernels and efficient inference by a variant of dynamic programming. by exploiting the inherently concurrent structure, the proposed approach is designed to work with the highly parallel graphics processors (gpus) to facilitate realtime analysis. our empirical study demonstrates that the proposed approach works in realtime (over 80 frames per second) and at the same time performs competitively against state-of-the-art offline and quasi-realtime methods.

the kinetic analysis of esterase inhibition by acylating compounds (organophosphorus carbamates and sulfonyl fluorides) is sometimes unable to yield consistent results by fitting simple inhibition kinetic models to experimental data of complex systems. in this work, kinetic data were obtained for phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf) tested at different concentrations incubated for up to 3 h with soluble fraction of chicken peripheral nerve. pmsf is a protease and esterase inhibitor causing protection or potentiation of the organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy and is unstable in water solution. the target of the promotion effect was proposed to be a soluble esterase not yet identified. a kinetic model equation was deduced assuming a multienzymatic system with three different molecular phenomena occurring simultaneously: (1) inhibition, (2) spontaneous chemical hydrolysis of the inhibitor and (3) ongoing inhibition (inhibition during the substrate reaction). a three-dimensional fit of the model was applied for analyzing the experimental data. the best-fitting model is compatible with a resistant component (16.5–18%) and two sensitive enzymatic entities (both 41%). the corresponding second-order rate constants of inhibition (ki = 12.04 × 10−2 and 0.54 × 10−2 μm−1 min−1, respectively) and the chemical hydrolysis constant of pmsf (kh = 0.0919 min−1) were simultaneously estimated. these parameters were similar to those deduced in fixed-time inhibition experiments. the consistency of results in both experiments was considered an internal validation of the methodology. the results were also consistent with a significant ongoing inhibition. the proportion of enzymatic components showed in this work is similar to those previously observed in inhibition experiments with mipafox, s9b and paraoxon, demonstrating that this kinetic approach gives consistent results in complex enzymatic systems.  type b carboxylesterases (acetylcholinesterases, neuropathy target esterase, serine peptidases), catalyse the hydrolysis of carboxyl-ester substrates by formation of a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate and subsequent cleavage and release of the acyl group. organophosphorus compounds, carbamates, and others exert their mechanism of neurotoxicity by permanent covalent organophosphorylation or carbamylation at the catalytic site of carboxylesterases. classical kinetic studies converted the exponential kinetic equation to a logarithmic equation for graphic analysis. this process, however, does not allow analysing complex situations. in this paper, kinetic model equations are reviewed and strategies developed for the following cases: (a) single enzyme, with classical linear equation; (b) multi-enzymatic system—discriminating several inhibitor-sensitive and inhibitor-resistant components; (c) ‘ongoing inhibition’—high sensitive enzymes can be significantly inhibited during the substrate reaction time, the model equations need a correction; (d) spontaneous reactivation (de-phosphorylation)—one or several components can be simultaneously inhibited and spontaneously reactivated; (e) spontaneous reactivation from starting time with the enzyme being partly or totally inhibited; (f) aging—single enzyme can be inhibited, spontaneously reactivated and dealkylating reaction (‘aging’) simultaneously occurs; and (g) aging and spontaneous reactivation from starting time with the enzyme being partly or totally inhibited. analysis of data using the suggested equations allows the deduction of inhibition kinetic constants and the proportions of each of the enzymatic components. strategies for practical application of the models and for obtaining consistent kinetic parameters, using multi-steps approaches or 3d fitting, are presented.
during corticogenesis, neuronal migration is an essential step for formation of a functional brain, and abnormal migration is known to cause various neurological disorders. neuronal migration is not just a simple movement of the cell body, but a consequence of various morphological changes and coordinated subcellular events. recent advances in in vivo and ex vivo cell biological approaches, such as in utero gene transfer, slice culture and ex vivo chemical inhibitor techniques, have revealed details of the morphological and molecular aspects of neuronal migration. migrating neurons have been found to have a unique structure, dilation or swelling, at the proximal region of the leading process; this structure is not found in other migrating cell types. the formation of this structure is followed by nuclear deformation and forward movement, and coordination of this three-step sequential morphological change (the dilation/swelling formation, nuclear elongation and nuclear movement) is essential for proper neuronal migration and the construction of a functional brain structure. in this review, we will introduce the morphological features of this unique structure in migrating neurons and summarize what is known about the molecules regulating the dilation/swelling formation and nuclear deformation and movement.  during neural development, the cytoskeleton of newborn neurons undergoes extensive and dynamic remodelling to facilitate the sequential steps of neurogenesis, cell migration and terminal differentiation. it is clear from studying the mechanisms that precipitate these functions that different configurations of the cytoskeleton prefigure the correct execution of each step and define cohorts of proteins the functions of which are indispensable for the control of neuronal migration but not terminal differentiation. these combinatorial protein functions are also predetermined by regulated gene expression and the precise subcellular localisation of their protein products. here, we expand on this view in the context of recent data on how the cytoskeleton is regulated during the maturation of cortical neurons within the developing brain.
estimates of population density and abundance are essential for the assessment of nonhuman primate conservation status, especially in view of increasing threats. we undertook the most extensive systematic primate survey yet of the udzungwa mountains of tanzania, an outstanding region for primate endemism and conservation in africa. we used distance sampling to survey three arboreal monkey species, including the endangered and endemic udzungwa red colobus (procolobus gordonorum). overall, we encountered 306 primate clusters over 287 km walked along 162 line transects. we found the lowest cluster densities for both red colobus and angolan colobus (colobus angolensis; 0.8 clusters/km2) in the least protected forest (uzungwa scarp forest reserve, us), while we found the highest densities (3.2 and 2.6 clusters/km2 for red colobus; 3.2 and 2.7 clusters/km2for angolan colobus) in two large and protected forests in the national park. unexpectedly, magombera, a small forest surrounded by plantations, had the highest densities of red colobus (5.0 clusters/km2), most likely a saturation effect due to the rapid shrinking of the forest. in contrast, sykes’ monkey (cercopithecus mitis monoides/moloneyi) had more similar densities across forests (3.1–6.6 clusters/km2), including us, suggesting greater resilience to disturbance in this species. for the endemic red colobus monkey, we estimated an abundance of 45–50,000 individuals across all forests, representing ca. 80% of the global population. though this is a relatively high abundance, the increasing threats in some of the udzungwa forests are of continued concern for the long-term survival of red colobus and other primates in the area.  abstract hunting and habitat degradation are universal threats to primates across the tropics, thus deciphering the relative impact of threats on population relative abundance is critical to predicting extinction risk and providing conservation recommendations. we studied diurnal primates over a period of nearly 6 years in the udzungwa mountains of tanzania, a site of global importance for primate conservation. we assessed how population relative abundance of five species (of which two are endemic and iucn-endangered) differed between two forest blocks that are similar in size and habitat types but contrast strongly in protection level, and how abundance changed during 2004–2009. we also measured habitat and disturbance parameters and, in the unprotected forest, evaluated hunting practices. we found significant differences in primates’ abundance between protected and unprotected forests, with the greater contrast being the lower abundance of colobine monkeys (udzungwa red colobus and angolan colobus) in the unprotected forest. at this site moreover, colobines declined to near-extinction over the study period. in contrast, two cercopithecines (sanje mangabey and sykes’ monkey) showed slightly higher abundance in the unprotected forest and did not decline significantly. we argue that escalating hunting in the unprotected forest has specifically impacted the canopy-dwelling colobus monkeys, although habitat degradation may also have reduced their abundance. in contrast, cercopithecines did not seem affected by the current hunting, and their greater ecological adaptability may explain the relatively higher abundance in the unprotected forest. we provide recommendations towards the long-term protection of the area.
the advent of high-resolution digital cameras and sophisticated multi-view stereo algorithms offers the promise of unprecedented geometric fidelity in image-based modeling tasks, but it also puts unprecedented demands on camera calibration to fulfill these promises. this paper presents a novel approach to camera calibration where top-down information from rough camera parameter estimates and the output of a multi-view-stereo system on scaled-down input images is used to effectively guide the search for additional image correspondences and significantly improve camera calibration parameters using a standard bundle adjustment algorithm (lourakis and argyros 2008). the proposed method has been tested on six real datasets including objects without salient features for which image correspondences cannot be found in a purely bottom-up fashion, and objects with high curvature and thin structures that are lost in visual hull construction even with small errors in camera parameters. three different methods have been used to qualitatively assess the improvements of the camera parameters. the implementation of the proposed algorithm is publicly available at furukawa and ponce (2008b).  we show that surface reconstruction from oriented points can be cast as a spatial poisson problem. this poisson formulation considers all the points at once, without resorting to heuristic spatial partitioning or blending, and is therefore highly resilient to data noise. unlike radial basis function schemes, our poisson approach allows a hierarchy of locally supported basis functions, and therefore the solution reduces to a well conditioned sparse linear system. we describe a spatially adaptive multiscale algorithm whose time and space complexities are proportional to the size of the reconstructed model. experimenting with publicly available scan data, we demonstrate reconstruction of surfaces with greater detail than previously achievable.
yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, is best known for historical pandemics, but still actively causes disease in many parts of the world. y. pestis is a recently derived clone of the pathogenic species yersinia pseudotuberculosis, but is more associated with human infection. numerous studies have documented genomic changes since the two species differentiated, although all of these studies used a relatively small sample set for defining these differences. in this study, we compared the complete genomic content between a diverse set of y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis genomes, and identified unique loci that could serve as diagnostic markers or for better understanding the evolution and pathogenesis of each group. comparative genomics analyses also identified subtle variations in gene content between individual monophyletic clades within these species, based on a core genome single nucleotide polymorphism phylogeny that would have been undetected in a less comprehensive genome dataset. we also screened loci that were identified in other published studies as unique to either species and generally found a non-uniform distribution, suggesting that the assignment of these unique genes to either species should be re-evaluated in the context of current sequencing efforts. overall, this study provides a high-resolution view into the genomic differences between y. pestis and y. pseudotuberculosis, demonstrating fine-scale differentiation and unique gene composition in both species.  the blast programs are widely used tools for searching protein and dna databases for sequence similarities. for protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the blast programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. a new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped blast program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. in addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by blast into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. the resulting position-specific iterated blast (psi-blast) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped blast, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. psi-blast is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the brct superfamily.
to examine the effect of pain and mild cognitive impairment (mci)—together and separately—on performance‐based and self‐reported mobility outcomes in older adults in primary care with mild to moderate self‐reported mobility limitations.  background the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (mci) and mobility limitations is high among older adults. the aim of this study was to investigate the association between mci status and both performance-based and self-report measures of mobility in community-dwelling older adults.   methods an analysis was conducted on baseline data from the boston rehabilitative impairment study in the elderly study, a cohort study of 430 primary care patients aged 65 or older. neuropsychological tests identified participants with mci and further subclassified those with impairment in memory domains (amci), nonmemory domains (namci), and multiple domains (mdmci). linear regression models were used to assess the association between mci status and mobility performance in the habitual gait speed, figure of 8 walk, short physical performance battery, and self-reported late life function and disability instrument's basic lower extremity and advanced lower extremity function scales.   results participants had a mean age of 76.6 years, and 42% were characterized with mci. participants with mci performed significantly worse than participants without mci (no-mci) on all performance and self-report measures (p < .01). all mci subtypes performed significantly worse than no-mci on all mobility measures (p < .05) except for amci versus no-mci on the figure of 8 walk (p = .054) and basic lower extremity (p = .11). moreover, compared with amci, mdmci manifested worse performance on the figure of 8 walk and short physical performance battery, and namci manifested worse performance on short physical performance battery and basic lower extremity.   conclusions among older community-dwelling primary care patients, performance on a broad range of mobility measures was worse among those with mci, appearing poorest among those with nonmemory mci.
background and aims exposure to air pollution has been linked to total and cardiopulmonary mortality. however, few studies have examined the effects of exposure over decades, or which time windows of long term exposure are most relevant. we investigated the long term effects of residential air pollution on total and cause-specific mortality and incidence of myocardial infarction in a well-characterized cohort of men in sweden.   methods a cohort of 7494 men in gothenburg was examined in 1970-1973 and followed subsequently to determine predictors of cardiovascular disease. we collected data on residential address and cause-specific mortality for the years 1973-2007. each individual was assigned yearly nitrogen oxides (nox) exposure based on dispersion models. using multivariable cox regression and generalized additive models with time-dependent exposure, we studied the association between three different time windows of residential nox exposure, and selected outcomes.   results in the years 1973-2007, a total of 5669 deaths, almost half of which were due to cardiovascular diseases, occurred in the cohort. levels of nox exposure decreased during the study period, from a median of 38 µg/m(3) in 1973 to 17 µg/m(3) in 2007. total non-accidental mortality was associated with participants' nox exposure in the last year (the year of outcome) (hr 1.03, 95% ci 1.01-1.05, per 10 µg/m(3)), with the mean nox exposure during the last 5 years, and with the mean nox exposure since enrolment (hr 1.02, 95% ci 1.01-1.04 for both). the associations were similar (hr 1.01-1.03), but generally not statistically significant, for cardiovascular, ischemic heart disease, and acute myocardial infarction mortality, and weaker for cerebrovascular and respiratory mortality. there was no association between nox exposure and incident myocardial infarction.   discussion and conclusions long term residential exposure to nox at these relatively low exposure levels in gothenburg was associated with total non-accidental mortality. the association was as strong for nox exposure in the last year as for longer exposure windows. the effect was near linear, and only marginally affected by confounders and effect modifiers. the improved air quality in gothenburg has by these estimates led to a 6% decrease in excess non-accidental mortality during the study period.  background: the association of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes with air pollution exposures has been well established in the literature. the number of studies examining chronic exposures in cohorts is growing, with more recent studies conducted among women finding risk estimates of greater magnitude. questions remain regarding sex differences in the relationship of chronic particulate matter (pm) exposures with mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. objectives: in this study we explored these associations in the all-male health professionals follow-up study prospective cohort. methods: the same spatiotemporal exposure estimation models, similar outcomes, and biennially updated covariates were used as those previously applied in the female nurses’ health study cohort. results: among 17,545 men residing in the northeastern and midwestern united states, there were 2,813 deaths, including 746 cases of fatal coronary heart disease (chd). an interquartile range change (4 µg/m3) in average exposure to pm ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter in the 12 previous months was not associated with all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (hr) = 0.94; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.87–1.00] or fatal chd (hr = 0.99; 95% ci, 0.87–1.13) in fully adjusted models. findings were similar for separate models of exposure to pm ≤ 10 µm in diameter and pm between 2.5 and 10 µm in diameter and for copollutant models. conclusions: among this cohort of men with high socioeconomic status living in the midwestern and northeastern united states, the results did not support an association of chronic pm exposures with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in models with time-varying covariates. whether these findings suggest sex differences in susceptibility or the protective impact of healthier lifestyles and higher socioeconomic status requires additional investigation.
leg venous pressure markedly falls during upright exercise via a muscle pump effect, creating de novo perfusion pressure. we examined physiological roles of this mechanism in increasing femoral artery blood flow (fabf) and its alterations in chronic heart failure (chf). in 10 normal subjects and 10 patients with chf, standard hemodynamic variables, mean ankle vein pressure (mavp), and fabf with doppler techniques were obtained during graded upright bicycle exercise. to evaluate a nonspecific blood flow response, normal subjects also performed supine exercise. in normal subjects, mavp rapidly declined by 45 mmhg and fabf correspondingly increased 5.3-fold without a systemic pressor response during 10 s of light upright exercise at 5 w. approximately 67% of the blood flow response was attributed to the venous pressure drop-dependent mechanism. in chf patients, mavp declined by only 36 mmhg and fabf increased only 1.7-fold during the same upright exercise. the muscle venous pump has an ability to increase fabf at least threefold via the venous pressure drop-dependent mechanism. this mechanism is impaired in chf patients.  summaryxamoterol acts as aβ1-adrenoceptor agonist at low sympathetic activity and as an antagonist at high activity. although its long-term efficacy has been proven in patients with mild to moderate heart failure, it remains unclear which effect, agonism or antagonism, accounts for its long-term activity.to clarify the effect of xamoterol on cardiac sympathetic activity in daily life, 24-h r-r interval histograms were obtained during administration of xamoterol 100 mg b. d. for 1 week to 10 patients with mild to moderate heart failure. eight normal subjects were also studied as controls. to examine the relation between the effect of xamoterol and sympathetic activity, plasma noradrenaline (na) levels were measured under 5 graded conditions simulating daily living.xamoterol administration significantly decreased the standard deviation of the r-r interval, both in patients with heart failure and in normal subjects. the mean r-r interval, however, was increased in patients with heart failure, relative to normal subjects.in both groups, the r-r interval histograms had two peaks, i. e. a short daytime peak and a long night-time peak. xamoterol decreased the median of the night-time peak without changing the daytime peak in normal subjects. in contrast, it increased the median of the daytime peak without producing a significant change in the nighttime peak in patients with heart failure. levels of plasma na were significantly higher in patients than in normal subjects under all conditions.thus, in normal subjects xamoterol predominantly increased the slower heart rate at night with only a minor effect on the higher heart rate in the daytime, whereas it predominantly attenuated the daytime tachycardia induced by sympathetic stimulation in patients with heart failure.it is concluded that xamoterol tends overall to act as aβ-adrenoceptor antagonist during the day, especially in the daytime in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. its antagonist rather than its agonist effect may account for the long-term efficacy of xamoterol in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.
background japanese encephalitis virus (jev), a member of the flaviviridae family, causes around 68,000 encephalitis cases annually, of which 20–30% are fatal, while 30–50% of the recovered cases develop severe neurological sequelae. specific antivirals for jev would be of great importance, particularly in those cases where the infection has become persistent. being indispensable for flaviviral replication, the ns2b-ns3 protease is a promising target for design of anti-flaviviral inhibitors. contrary to related flaviviral proteases, the jev ns2b-ns3 protease is structurally and mechanistically much less characterized. here we aimed at establishing a straightforward procedure for cloning, expression, purification and biochemical characterization of jev ns2b(h)-ns3pro protease. methodology/principal findings the full-length sequence of jev ns2b-ns3 genotype iii strain jaoars 982 was obtained as a synthetic gene. the sequence of ns2b(h)-ns3pro was generated by splicing by overlap extension pcr (soe-pcr) and cloned into the ptrchisa vector. hexahistidine-tagged ns2b(h)-ns3pro, expressed in e. coli as soluble protein, was purified to >95% purity by a single-step immobilized metal affinity chromatography. sds-page and immunoblotting of the purified enzyme demonstrated ns2b(h)-ns3pro precursor and its autocleavage products, ns3pro and ns2b(h), as 36, 21, and 10 kda bands, respectively. kinetic parameters, k m and k cat, for fluorogenic protease model substrates, boc-grr-amc, boc-lrr-amc, ac-nkrr-amc, bz-nkrr-amc, pyr-rtkr-amc and abz-(r)4sag-ny-amide, were obtained using inner filter effect correction. the highest catalytic efficiency k cat /k m was found for pyr-rtkr-amc (k cat/k m: 1962.96±85.0 m−1 s−1) and the lowest for boc-lrr-amc (k cat/k m: 3.74±0.3 m−1 s−1). jev ns3pro is inhibited by aprotinin but to a lesser extent than den and wnv ns3pro. conclusions/significance a simplified procedure for the cloning, overexpression and purification of the ns2b(h)-ns3pro was established which is generally applicable to other flaviviral proteases. kinetic parameters obtained for a number of model substrates and inhibitors, are useful for the characterization of substrate specificity and eventually for the design of high-throughput assays aimed at antiviral inhibitor discovery.  the ns3 (dengue virus non-structural protein 3) serine protease of dengue virus is an essential component for virus maturation, thus representing an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs directed at the inhibition of polyprotein processing. in the present study, we have investigated determinants of substrate specificity of the dengue virus ns3 protease by using internally quenched fluorogenic peptides containing abz (o-aminobenzoic acid; synonymous to anthranilic acid) and 3-nitrotyrosine (ny) representing both native and chimaeric polyprotein cleavage site sequences. by using this combinatorial approach, we were able to describe the substrate preferences and determinants of specificity for the dengue virus ns2b(h)-ns3pro protease. kinetic parameters (kcat/k(m)) for the hydrolysis of peptide substrates with systematic truncations at the prime and non-prime side revealed a length preference for peptides spanning the p4-p3' residues, and the peptide abz-rrrrsagny-amide based on the dengue virus capsid protein processing site was discovered as a novel and efficient substrate of the ns3 protease (kcat/k(m)=11087 m(-1) x s(-1)). thus, while having confirmed the exclusive preference of the ns3 protease for basic residues at the p1 and p2 positions, we have also shown that the presence of basic amino acids at the p3 and p4 positions is a major specificity-determining feature of the dengue virus ns3 protease. investigation of the substrate peptide abz-kkqragvlny-amide based on the ns2b/ns3 polyprotein cleavage site demonstrated an unexpected high degree of cleavage efficiency. chimaeric peptides with combinations of prime and non-prime sequences spanning the p4-p4' positions of all five native polyprotein cleavage sites revealed a preponderant effect of non-prime side residues on the k(m) values, whereas variations at the prime side sequences had higher impact on kcat.
the development of knowledge discovery in databases (kdd) projects in collaborative and distributed environments requires facilities to search for, choose, set-up, compose and execute suitable data manipulation tools. this implies the necessity to explicitly represent and annotate different kinds of information about tools, data and their characteristics. in this framework, we are developing a service-oriented support platform called knowledge discovery in databases virtual mart. in this paper we discuss the design and implementation of the uddi service broker, a core element of the platform. we analyze the information needed to describe a tool in our platform, showing limitations of the present uddi standard. then, we present our solution to overcome such limitations and to extend uddi broker capabilities.  the recent trend of application service providers (asp) is indicative of electronic commerce diversifying and expanding to include e-services. the asp paradigm is leading to the emergence of several web-based data mining service providers. this chapter focuses on the architectural and technological issues in the construction of systems that deliver data mining services through the internet. the chapter presents on-going research and the operations of commercial data mining service providers. we evaluate different distributed data mining (ddm) architectural models in the context of their suitability to support webbased delivery of data mining services. we present emerging technologies and standards in the e-services domain and discuss their impact on a “virtual marketplace of data mining e-services”.
evaluating human brain potentials during watching different images can be used for memory evaluation, information retrieving, guilty-innocent identification and examining the brain response. in this study, the effects of watching images, with different levels of familiarity, on subjects' electroencephalogram (eeg) have been studied. three different groups of images with three familiarity levels of "unfamiliar", "familiar" and "very familiar" have been considered for this study. eeg signals of 21 subjects (14 men) were recorded. after signal acquisition, pre-processing, including noise and artifact removal, were performed on epochs of data. features, including spatial-statistical, wavelet, frequency and harmonic parameters, and also correlation between recording channels, were extracted from the data. then, we evaluated the efficiency of the extracted features by using p-value and also an orthogonal feature selection method (combination of gram-schmitt method and fisher discriminant ratio) for feature dimensional reduction. as the final step of feature selection, we used 'add-r take-away l' method for choosing the most discriminative features. for data classification, including all two-class and three-class cases, we applied support vector machine (svm) on the extracted features. the correct classification rates (ccr) for "unfamiliar-familiar", "unfamiliar-very familiar" and "familiar-very familiar" cases were 85.6%, 92.6%, and 70.6%, respectively. the best results of classifications were obtained in pre-frontal and frontal regions of brain. also, wavelet, frequency and harmonic features were among the most discriminative features. finally, in three-class case, the best ccr was 86.8%.  behavioral researches have shown that the visual function can be partly restored by phosphene-based prosthetic vision for the non-congenital blinds. however, the early visual processing mechanisms of phosphene object recognition is still unclear. this paper aimed to investigate the electro-neurophysiology underlying the phosphene face and non-face recognition. the modulations of latency and amplitude of n170 component in the event-related potential (erp) were analyzed. our preliminary results showed that (1) both normal and phosphene face stimuli could elicit prominent n170; nevertheless, phosphene stimuli caused notable latency delay and amplitude suppression on n170 compared with normal stimuli and (2) under phosphene non-face stimuli, a slight but significant latency delay occurred compared with normal stimuli, while amplitude suppression was not observed. therefore, it was suggested that (1) phosphene perception caused a disruption of the early visual processing for non-canonical images of objects, which was more profound in phosphene face processing; (2) the face-specific processing was reserved under prosthetic vision and (3) holistic processing was the major stage in early visual processing of phosphene face recognition, while part-based processing was attenuated due to the loss of the details.
to identify regions involved in tissue specific regulation of transcription of the alpha1(vi) collagen chain, transgenic mice were generated carrying various portions of the gene's 5'-flanking sequence fused to the e. coli beta-galactosidase gene. analysis of the transgene expression pattern by x-gal staining of embryos revealed that: (a) the proximal 0.6 kb of promoter sequence activated transcription in mesenchymal cells at sites of insertion of superficial muscular aponeurosis into the skin; tendons were also faintly positive. (b) the region between -4.0 and -5.4 kb from the transcription start site was required for activation of the transgene in nerves. it also drove expression in joints, in intervertebral disks, and in subepidermal and vibrissae mesenchyme. (c) the fragment comprised within -6.2 and -7.5 kb was necessary for high level transcription in skeletal muscle and meninges. positive cells in muscle were mostly mononuclear and probably included connective tissue elements, although staining of myoblasts was not ruled out. this fragment also activated expression in joints, in intervertebral disks, and in subepidermal and vibrissae mesenchyme. (d) beta-galactosidase staining in vibrissae induced by the sequences -4.0 to -5.4 and -6.2 to -7.5 was not coincident: with the latter sequence labeled nuclei were found mainly in the ventral and posterior quadrant, and, histologically, in the outer layers of mesenchyme surrounding and between the follicles, whereas with the former the remaining quadrants were positive and expressing cells were mostly in the inner layers of the dermal sheath. (e) other tissues, notably lung, adrenal gland, digestive tract, which produce high amounts of collagen type vi, did not stain for beta-galactosidase. (f) central nervous system and retina, in which the endogenous gene is inactive, expressed the lacz transgene in most lines. the data suggest that transcription of alpha1(vi) in different tissues is regulated by distinct sequence elements in a modular arrangement, a mechanism which confers high flexibility in the temporal and spatial pattern of expression during development.  the expression of type vi collagen has been studied in mouse tissues. by northern blotting, the mrna for the alpha 1 (vi) chain was detectable in whole embryos at 10.5 days postcoitum and steeply increased afterward. the messenger levels were high at birth, but decreased rapidly in the following days, reaching low levels in adult animals. in 2-month-old mice, lung, skin, adrenal gland, heart, skeletal muscle and tail and fat were among the most active producers of alpha 1 (vi) mrna. in situ hybridization first identified mrna for alpha 1 (vi) collagen in mesenchymal cells of 10.5-day embryos in various locations, including serosae, branchial arches, large blood vessels and the cephalic mesenchyme. staining increased at later stages of development and most connective tissues were positive at 16.5 days and later. strongly staining tissues were joints, intervertebral disks, perichondrium, periostium, dermis, skeletal muscle and heart valves, whereas cartilage and bone were very poorly labelled. epithelia and the central nervous system were completely negative. in several organs, notably lung, salivary glands and the digestive tract, staining was concentrated underneath epithelia. this staining pattern was different from that for collagen type i, which was evenly distributed in the subepithelial mesenchyme. the pattern of distribution of the protein, revealed by immunocytochemistry, was coincident with that of the alpha 1 (vi) mrna. in addition, the results confirmed that type vi collagen is preferentially deposited in the pericellular environment. this was particularly evident in skeletal muscle. the data show that type vi collagen is mainly produced by mesenchymal cells and suggest a role for the protein in delineating the boundary of distinct domains in connective tissue.
in this study the chlorophenol-degrading actinobacterium, arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6, was tested for its ability to grow on mixtures of phenolic compounds. during the experiments depletion of the compounds was monitored, as were cell growth and activity. activity assays were based on bioluminescence output from a luciferase-tagged strain. when the cells were grown on a mixture of 4-chlorophenol, 4-nitrophenol and phenol, 4-chlorophenol degradation apparently was delayed until 4-nitrophenol was almost completely depleted. phenol was degraded more slowly than the other compounds and not until 4-nitrophenol and 4-chlorophenol were depleted, despite this being the least toxic compound of the three. a similar order of degradation was observed in non-sterile soil slurries inoculated with a. chlorophenolicus. the kinetics of degradation of the substituted phenols suggest that the preferential order of their depletion could be due to their respective pka values and that the dissociated phenolate ions are the substrates. a mutant strain (t99), with a disrupted hydroxyquinol dioxygenase gene in the previously described 4-chlorophenol degradation gene cluster, was also studied for its ability to grow on the different phenols. the mutant strain was able to grow on phenol, but not on either of the substituted phenols, suggesting a different catabolic pathway for the degradation of phenol by this microorganism.  abstract arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6, a previously described 4-chlorophenol-degrading strain, was found to degrade 4-chlorophenol via hydroxyquinol, which is a novel route for aerobic microbial degradation of this compound. in addition, 10 open reading frames exhibiting sequence similarity to genes encoding enzymes involved in chlorophenol degradation were cloned and designated part of a chlorophenol degradation gene cluster (cph genes). several of the open reading frames appeared to encode enzymes with similar functions; these open reading frames included two genes, cpha-i and cpha-ii, which were shown to encode functional hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenases. disruption of the cpha-i gene yielded a mutant that exhibited negligible growth on 4-chlorophenol, thereby linking the cph gene cluster to functional catabolism of 4-chlorophenol in a. chlorophenolicus a6. the presence of a resolvase pseudogene in the cph gene cluster together with analyses of the g+c content and codon bias of flanking genes suggested that horizontal gene transfer was involved in assembly of the gene cluster during evolution of the ability of the strain to grow on 4-chlorophenol.
regular interactions between commensal bacteria and the enteric mucosal immune environment are necessary for normal immunity. alterations of the commensal bacterial communities or mucosal barrier can disrupt immune function. chronic stress interferes with bacterial community structure (specifically, α-diversity) and the integrity of the intestinal barrier. these interferences can contribute to chronic stress-induced increases in systemic il-6 and tnf-α. chronic stress, however, produces many physiological changes that could indirectly influence immune activity. in addition to il-6 and tnf-α, exposure to acute stressors upregulates a plethora of inflammatory proteins, each having unique synthesis and release mechanisms. we therefore tested the hypothesis that acute stress-induced inflammatory protein responses are dependent on the commensal bacteria, and more specifically, lipopolysaccharide (lps) shed from gram-negative intestinal commensal bacteria. we present evidence that both reducing commensal bacteria using antibiotics and neutralizing lps using endotoxin inhibitor (ei) attenuates increases in some (inflammasome dependent, il-1 and il-18), but not all (inflammasome independent, il-6, il-10, and mcp-1) inflammatory proteins in the blood of male f344 rats exposed to an acute tail shock stressor. acute stress did not impact α- or β- diversity measured using 16s rrna diversity analyses, but selectively reduced the relative abundance of prevotella. these findings indicate that commensal bacteria contribute to acute stress-induced inflammatory protein responses, and support the presence of lps-mediated signaling in stress-evoked cytokine and chemokine production. the selectivity of the commensal bacteria in stress-evoked il-1β and il-18 responses may implicate the inflammasome in this response.  motivation biological sequence data is accumulating rapidly, motivating the development of improved high-throughput methods for sequence classification.   results ublast and usearch are new algorithms enabling sensitive local and global search of large sequence databases at exceptionally high speeds. they are often orders of magnitude faster than blast in practical applications, though sensitivity to distant protein relationships is lower. uclust is a new clustering method that exploits usearch to assign sequences to clusters. uclust offers several advantages over the widely used program cd-hit, including higher speed, lower memory use, improved sensitivity, clustering at lower identities and classification of much larger datasets.   availability binaries are available at no charge for non-commercial use at http://www.drive5.com/usearch.
background the unique positioning of the patient at steep trendelenburg with prolonged and increased intra-abdominal pressure (iap) during robotic radical prostatectomy may increase the risk of splanchnic ischemia. we aimed to investigate the acute effects of iap and steep trendelenburg position on the level of ischemia modified albumin (ima) and to test if serum ima levels might be used as a surrogate marker for possible covert ischemia during robotic radical prostatectomies.   patients and methods fifty asa i-ii patients scheduled for elective robotic radical prostatectomy were included in this investigation.   exclusion criteria the patients were excluded from the study when an arterial cannulation could not be accomplished, if the case had to be converted to open surgery or if the calculated intraoperative bleeding exceeded 300ml. all the patients were placed in steep (45 degrees) trendelenburg position following trocar placement. throughout the operation the iap was maintained between 11-14mmhg. mean arterial blood pressure (map), cardiac output (co) were continuously monitored before the induction and throughout the surgery. blood gases, electrolytes, urea, creatinine, alanine transferase (alt), aspartate transferase (ast) were recorded. additionally, ima levels were measured before, during and after surgery.   results (1) map, co, lactate and hemoglobin (hb) did not significantly change in any period of surgery (p>0.05); (2) sodium (p<0.01), potassium (p<0.05) and urea (p<0.05) levels decreased at postoperative period, and no significant changes at creatinine, ast, alt levels were observed in these patients; (3) at the end of surgery (180 min) pco2, po2, hco3 and be did not change compared to after induction values (p>0.05) but mild acidosis was present in these patients (p<0.01 vs. after induction); (4) ima levels were found to be comparable before induction (0.34±0.04), after induction (0.31±0.06) and at the end of surgery (0.29±0.05) as well.   conclusion we did not demonstrate any significant mesenteric-splanchnic ischemia which could be detected by serum ima levels during robotic radical prostatectomies performed under steep trendelenburg position and when iap is maintained in between 11-14 mmhg.  background and objective the aim of this study was to compare the effects of propofol and n-acetyl cysteine (nac) on tourniquet-induced ischaemia–reperfusion injury by determining malonyldialdehyde, ischaemia-modified albumin, lactate, blood gas and haemodynamic levels in arthroscopic knee surgery. methods sixty asa i or ii patients were randomized into three groups. intrathecal anaesthesia was administered using 0.5% heavy bupivacaine in all patients. in group p, propofol was administered in a 0.2 mg kg−1 bolus, followed by infusion at a rate of 2 mg kg−1 h−1; in group nac, nac was administered as an infusion at a rate of 5 mg kg−1 h−1, and, in group c (the control group), an equal volume of isotonic saline was administered to patients until 30 min after reperfusion. blood samplings were obtained immediately before intrathecal anaesthesia (t1), 1 min before tourniquet release (t2), 5 min after tourniquet release (t3) and 30 min after tourniquet release (t4). results plasma malonyldialdehyde, ischaemia-modified albumin and lactate levels increased significantly in group c at t3 and t4 compared with the baseline values. plasma concentrations of malonyldialdehyde, ischaemia-modified albumin and lactate in groups p and nac were significantly lower than those in group c at t3 and t4. in blood gas analyses, ph, hco3 and base excess were found to be significantly lower at t3 and t4 compared with t1 and t2 in group c. comparisons between groups p and nac revealed no significant differences. conclusion small-dose infusions of both propofol and nac appear to provide similar protection against ischaemia–reperfusion injury in arthroscopic knee surgery.
background and aimsrecent studies suggest that root border cells function in defense of the root by an extracellular dna-based trapping mechanism similar to that described in mammalian white blood cells. genes controlling the specialized properties of border cells as they detach from the root tip therefore are of interest.methodsmrna differential display was used to identify brd13, a sequence expressed in border cells but not other root tissues. rnase protection and mrna northern blot analyses, and reporter gene expression under the control of the brd13 promoter in transgenic hairy roots were used to confirm localized expression. phenotype analysis of transgenic hairy roots expressing brd13 antisense mrna was carried out.resultsbrd13 was expressed constitutively in border cells but not in leaves, stems, or roots without border cells. the predicted protein shares sequence similarity with flavin-binding proteins. transgenic hairy roots expressing brd13 antisense mrna exhibited abnormal growth and morphology.conclusionswe report here that altered expression of a putative flavin-binding protein in border cells resulted in altered root development. flavin-binding proteins play key roles in development, defense, and local auxin biosynthesis. the brd13 gene and its promoter may be useful in creating defined changes in root development and defense.  recently, ishikawa and evans (1995) focused attention on the immediately postmitotic growth zone of plant roots and indicated its importance in root growth in response to interna1 and externa1 factors. this previously unrecognized region of the root, intercalated between the apical meristem and the zone of rapid cell elongation, was originally discovered as the result of a morphometric analysis of the breadthlength ratios of cells along the length of the maize root (baluska et al., 1990). the analysis indicated that as cells are displaced away from the root apex, their growth is adjusted in such a way that, in the immediate postmitotic region, approximately isodiametric (cuboidal) cellular shapes are obtained. thus, the term "postmitotic 'isodiametric' growth" (or pig) was coined for this region. in the cortex of maize primary roots the pig zone was about 450 pm; in cultured tomato roots its length was about 380 pm. the length of this region thus represents about 5.5% of the entire growth zone. subsequent studies confirmed the uniqueness of the cells located in the pig zone, not only from a morphometrical point of view, but also on account of their specific cytological and physiological properties (barlow et al., 1991; baluska et al., l992,1994,1996a, 1996c; ishikawa and evans, 1992, 1993, 1995). from a cellular point of view, the root tip has (a) a zone of cell division, a zone of more-or-less isotropic cell growth in which the cells both elongate and increase in width at similar rates; and (b) a zone of elongation in which cell growth is distinctly anisotropic and the rate of elongation is much greater than in the pig zone. in cell-based terminology, therefore, the term "zone of cell elongation" should be reserved for root cells that grow in this strictly polar fashion. significantly, our morphometric studies at the cellular leve1 showed that an abrupt decline of cellular widening coincided precisely with a prominent increase in the rate of cell lengthening, and this occurred at the base of the pig region (baluska et al., 1990, 1994; barlow et al., 1991). this occurrence provided the first hint that the newly formed postmitotic cells of the root may undergo some kind of preparatory phase wherein they adjust or reorganize their growth from the formerly slow, mitotic mode of growth to a rapid mode of elongation. rapid cell elongation in roots is based in part on an extensive uptake of solutes coupled with the formation of a prominent vacuolar compartment. these events accelerate cell expansion, which is channeled with the aid of specific alignments of both the cortical microtubules (cmts) in the cytoplasm and the cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall, into strictly anisotropic cell enlargement. a significant reorganization of the metabolic machinery is required to achieve this new mode of cell growth. for example, cells of maize root apices increase their volume approximately 10-fold in the 13 h during which they migrate through the elongation region, whereas in the meristem cell volume may only double during this period (baluska et al., 1996~). once the rapid acceleration of cell growth has been triggered, it must be supported by a robust synthetic machinery that is obviously not yet operational in cells that are just ceasing their meristematic phase of development. if it were otherwise, root cells would commence their rapid elongation simultaneously with the termination of mitotic division. not a11 cells of the root cease to divide at the same distance from the root tip, and it was recently found that the proximal limit of the meristem fluctuates in a rhythmic manner in accordance with a programmed pattern of transverse cell division within its constituent cell files (liick et al., 1996). it is probably advantageous, therefore, for the early postmitotic root cells to enter a critica1 preparatory phase, located in a special transition zone behind the meristem, where they acquire the ability to embark on rapid elongation. moreover, some supracellular organizing process within this transition zone may ensure the simultaneous commencement of the rapid elongation phase in cells of different tissues (epidermis, cortex, stele, etc.) at a particular distance from the root tip. root-generated electric fields, for example, may be one way of defining the conditions required for a coordinated program of rapid elongation after cells have completed their preparatory phase within the transition zone. also, within this zone cells develop the necessary synthetic machinery for the biogenesis of new tonoplast and plasma membranes, cell-wall components, new enzymatic complexes, and cytoplasmic structures that support such rapid growth. aside from the basic synthetic machinery for cell growth, individual elements of the cytoskeleton can also be expected to alter their intracellular distribution from those configurations that support mitotic cell growth and division to arrangements that enable rapid cell elongation. in cells of the postmitotic transition zone, the cmts change from loosely organized transverse arrays to an exclusively transverse orientation with respect to the root axis; the latter orientation is often accompanied by the appearance of
hippocampal synaptic function and plasticity deteriorate with age, often resulting in learning and memory deficits. as micrornas (mirnas) are important regulators of neuronal protein expression, we examined whether mirnas may contribute to this age‐associated decline in hippocampal function. we first compared the small rna transcriptome of hippocampal tissues from young and old mice. among 269 hippocampal mirnas, 80 were differentially expressed (≥ twofold) among the age groups. we focused on 36 mirnas upregulated in the old mice compared with those in the young mice. the potential targets of these 36 mirnas included 11 critical eph/ephrin synaptic signaling components. the expression levels of several genes in the eph/ephrin pathway, including ephb2, were significantly downregulated in the aged hippocampus. ephb2 is a known regulator of synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons, in part by regulating the surface expression of the nmda receptor nr1 subunit. we found that ephb2 is a direct target of mir‐204 among mirnas that were upregulated with age. the transfection of primary hippocampal neurons with a mir‐204 mimic suppressed both ephb2 mrna and protein expression and reduced the surface expression of nr1. transfection of mir‐204 also decreased the total expression of nr1. mir‐204 induces senescence‐like phenotype in fully matured neurons as evidenced by an increase in p16‐positive cells. we suggest that aging is accompanied by the upregulation of mir‐204 in the hippocampus, which downregulates ephb2 and results in reduced surface and total nr1 expression. this mechanism may contribute to age‐associated decline in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and the related cognitive functions.  ephrin ligands and their cognate eph receptors guide axons during neural development and regulate synapse formation and neuronal plasticity in the adult. because ephrins are tethered to the plasma membrane and possess reverse signaling properties, the eph-ephrin system can function in a bidirectional, contact-mediated fashion between two opposing cells. eph receptors expressed on dendrites are activated by ephrins (on axons or on astrocytes) and regulate spine and synapse formation. they also participate in activity-induced long-term changes in synaptic strength such as long-term potentiation (ltp). when expressed on axon terminals, ephrins promote presynaptic differentiation and enhance neurotransmitter release, thereby supporting presynaptic forms of ltp. in some cases, eph receptors can simply act as ligands for ephrins without any requirement for eph receptor signaling, suggesting that the system does not always function bidirectionally.
sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (sef) is a rare soft tissue tumor exhibiting considerable morphologic overlap with low‐grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (lgfms). moreover, both sef and lgfms show muc4 expression by immunohistochemistry. while the majority of lgfms cases are characterized by a fus‐creb3l1 fusion, both fus‐creb3l2 and ewsr1‐creb3l1 fusions were recently demonstrated in a small number of lgfms and sef/lgfms hybrid tumors. in contrast, recent studies pointed out that sef harbor frequent ewsr1 rearrangements, with only a minority of cases showing fus‐creb3l2 fusions. in an effort to further characterize the molecular characteristics of pure sef and hybrid sef/lgfms lesions, we undertook a clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical and genetic analysis of a series of 10 sef and 8 hybrid sef/lgfms tumors. the mortality rate was similar between the two groups, 44% within the pure sef group and 37% in the hybrid sef/lgfms with a mean overall follow‐up of 66 months. all but one pure sef and all hybrid sef/lgfms‐tested cases showed muc4 immunoreactivity. the majority (90%) of pure sef cases showed ewsr1 gene rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridization with only one case exhibiting fus rearrangement. of the nine ewsr1 positive cases, six cases harbored creb3l1 break‐apart, two had creb3l2 rearrangement (a previously unreported finding) and one lacked evidence of creb3l1/2 abnormalities. in contrast, all hybrid sef/lgfms tumors exhibited fus and creb3l2 rearrangements. these results further demarcate a relative cytogenetic dichotomy between pure sef, often characterized by ewsr1 rearrangements, and hybrid sef/lgfms, harboring fus‐creb3l2 fusion; the latter group recapitulating the genotype of lgfms. © 2014 wiley periodicals, inc.  sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma is an unusual variant of fibrosarcoma composed of bland epithelioid cells deposited in a densely hyalinised collageneous matrix.a 41 year male patient admitted with complains of pain in right hip since 6 months. he was a known case of fibrosarcoma (soft tissue) operated 3 years ago. on examination, old scar on medial aspect of right thigh was seen. tenderness was present over right greater trochanter. a biopsy was performed which was diagnosed as sclerosing epithelioidfibrosarcoma.sclerosing epithelioidfibrosarcoma is a rare, slow growing, sarcoma of deep soft tissue with bland epithelioid tumor cells in nests and cords set in hyalinized fibrous stroma. as it is a clinically aggressive but histologically low-grade sarcoma with unsatisfactory treatment results and also has a high recurrence rate with high metastatic potential, it is important to consider this rare entity as a possible differential diagnosis in all suspicious soft tissue sarcomas.
embryonic stem (es) cells have the potential to differentiate into all cell types of the adult body, and could allow regeneration of damaged tissues. the challenge is to alter differentiation toward functional cell types or tissues by directing es cells to a specific fate. efforts have been made to understand the molecular mechanisms that are required for the formation of the different germ layers and tissues from es cells, and these mechanisms appear to be very similar in the mouse embryo. differentiation toward mesoderm and mesoderm derivatives such as cardiac tissue or hemangioblasts has been demonstrated; however, the roles of activin a/nodal, bone morphogenetic protein (bmp), and fibroblast growth factor (fgf) signaling in the early patterning of es cell-derived pan-mesoderm and anterior visceral endoderm (ave) have not been reported yet. we therefore analyzed the roles of activin a/nodal, bmp, and fgf signaling in the patterning of es cell-derived mesoderm as well as specification of the ave by using a dual es cell differentiation system combining a loss-of-function with a gain-of-function approach. we found that activin a or nodal directed the nascent mesoderm toward axial mesoderm and mesendoderm, while bmp4 was inducing posterior and extraembryonic mesoderm at the expense of anterior primitive streak cells. fgf signaling appeared to have an important role in mesoderm differentiation by allowing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of the newly formed mesoderm cells that would lead to their further patterning. moreover, inhibition of fgf signaling resulted in increased expression of axial mesoderm markers. additionally, we revealed that the formation of ave cells from es cells requires fgf-dependent activin a/nodal signaling and the attenuation of bmp4 signaling.  the vertebrate fgf8 gene produces multiple protein isoforms by alternative splicing. two evolutionarily conserved spliceforms, fgf8a and fgf8b, exhibit distinct bioactivities, with fgf8b having a more potent inductive activity due to higher affinity for fgf receptors. to investigate the in vivo requirement for fgf8b, we created a splice-site mutation abolishing fgf8b expression in mice. analysis of this mutant has uncovered a novel function of fgf8 signaling before the onset of gastrulation. we show that the loss of fgf8b disrupts the induction of the brachyury gene in the pregastrular embryo and, in addition, disrupts the proper alignment of the anteroposterior axis with the shape of the embryo and the uterine axes at embryonic day (e) 6.5. importantly, fgf8-null embryos display the same phenotype as fgf8b-deficient embryos at e6.5, demonstrating that signaling by fgf8b is specifically required for development of the pregastrular embryo. by contrast, during gastrulation, fgf8a can partially compensate for the loss of fgf8b in mesoderm specification. we show that an increased level of fgf8a expression, which leads to fgf4 expression in the primitive streak, can also promote mesoderm migration in the absence of fgf8b. therefore, different fgf signals may have distinct requirements for the morphogenesis and gene regulation before and during gastrulation. importantly, our findings implicate fgf8 in the morphogenetic process that establishes the defined relationship between the axes of the embryo and the uterus at the beginning of gastrulation, a perplexing phenomenon discovered two decades ago.
purposeusing a population health services perspective, this article defines and assesses an efficient criteria-based algorithm to identify treatment prevalent and incident cases of schizophrenia. we refer here “treatment” prevalence and incidence since its evaluation depends on a patient receiving a health care service with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.methodsa population-based cohort study was conducted among all adults having a hospital discharge or a physician claim for schizophrenia in the public health plan databases between january 1996 and december 2006. four algorithms to characterize patients with schizophrenia were defined. to identify treatment incident cases in 2006, we removed from the treatment prevalent pool patients with a previous record of schizophrenia between 1996 and 2006 (10-year clearance period). using this 10-year period as reference, kappa coefficients (kc) and positive predictive values (ppv) were calculated to determine the “optimal” length of clearance period to identify incident cases.resultsthe lifetime treatment prevalence and incidence of schizophrenia varied from 0.59 to 1.46% and from 42 to 94 per 100,000, respectively. when compared to the 10-year clearance period, the kc is excellent in a clearance period of 6–7 years. to achieve a ppv of 90%, a clearance period of 7–8 years would be necessary.conclusionswith an appropriate algorithm, treatment prevalence and incidence of schizophrenia can be conveniently estimated using administrative data. these estimates are a vital step toward appropriate planning of services for schizophrenia.  simple interval estimate methods for proportions exhibit poor coverage and can produce evidently inappropriate intervals. criteria appropriate to the evaluation of various proposed methods include: closeness of the achieved coverage probability to its nominal value; whether intervals are located too close to or too distant from the middle of the scale; expected interval width; avoidance of aberrations such as limits outside [0,1] or zero width intervals; and ease of use, whether by tables, software or formulae. seven methods for the single proportion are evaluated on 96,000 parameter space points. intervals based on tail areas and the simpler score methods are recommended for use. in each case, methods are available that aim to align either the minimum or the mean coverage with the nominal 1 -alpha.
six-month-olds reliably discriminate different monkey and human faces whereas 9-month-olds only discriminate different human faces. it is often falsely assumed that perceptual narrowing reflects a permanent change in perceptual abilities. in 3 experiments, ninety-six 12-month-olds' discrimination of unfamiliar monkey faces was examined. following 20 s of familiarization, and two 5-s visual-paired comparison test trials, 12-month-olds failed to show discrimination. however, following 40 s of familiarization and two 10-s test trials, 12-month-olds showed reliable discrimination of novel monkey faces. a final experiment was performed demonstrating 12-month-olds' discrimination of the monkey face was due to the increased familiarization rather than increased time of visual comparison. results are discussed in the context of perceptual narrowing, in particular the flexible nature of perceptual narrowing.  experience plays a crucial role for the normal development of many perceptual and cognitive functions, such as speech perception. for example, between 6 and 10 months of age, the infant's ability to discriminate among native speech sounds improves, whereas the ability to discriminate among foreign speech sounds declines. however, a recent investigation suggests that some experience with non-native languages from 9 months of age facilitates the maintenance of this ability at 12 months. nelson has suggested that the systems underlying face processing may be similarly sculpted by experience with different kinds of faces. in the current investigation, we demonstrate that, in human infants between 6 and 9 months of age, exposure to non-native faces, in this case, faces of barbary macaques (macaca sylvanus), facilitates the discrimination of monkey faces, an ability that is otherwise lost around 9 months of age. these data support, and further elucidate, the role of early experience in the development of face processing.
power system state estimation (psse) is a critical task for grid operation efficiency and system stability. physical laws dictate quadratic relationships between observable quantities and voltage state variables, hence rendering the psse problem nonconvex and np-hard. existing se solvers largely rely on iterative optimization methods or semidefinite relaxation (sdr) techniques. even when based on noiseless measurements, convergence of the former is sensitive to the initialization, while the latter is challenged by small-size measurements especially when voltage magnitudes are not available at all buses. at the price of running time, this paper proposes a novel feasible point pursuit (fpp)-based se solver, which iteratively seeks feasible solutions for a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming reformulation of the weighted least-squares (wls) se problem. numerical tests corroborate that the novel fpp-based se markedly improves upon the gauss-newton based wls and sdr-based se alternatives, also when noisy measurements are available.  state estimation (se) is an important task allowing power networks to monitor accurately the underlying system state, which is useful for security-constrained dispatch and power system control. for nonlinear ac power systems, se amounts to minimizing a weighted least-squares cost that is inherently nonconvex, thus giving rise to many local optima. as a result, estimators used extensively in practice rely on iterative optimization methods, which are destined to return only locally optimal solutions, or even fail to converge. a semidefinite programming (sdp) formulation for se has been advocated, which relies on the convex semidefinite relaxation (sdr) of the original problem and thereby renders it efficiently solvable. theoretical analysis under simplified conditions is provided to shed light on the near-optimal performance of the sdr-based se solution at polynomial complexity. the new approach is further pursued toward complementing traditional nonlinear measurements with linear synchrophasor measurements and reducing computational complexity through distributed implementations. numerical tests on the standard ieee 30- and 118-bus systems corroborate that the se algorithms outperform existing alternatives, and approach near-optimal performance.
numerous studies have shown that being able to resolve and recover from conflicts is of key importance for relationship satisfaction and stability in adults. less is known about the importance of these relationship dynamics in adolescent romantic relationships. therefore, this study investigated whether conflict resolution and recovery predict breakups in middle adolescent couples. couples who are able to resolve and recover from conflict were expected to demonstrate a lower probability of breaking up. in total, 80 adolescent couples (m age = 15.48, sd = 1.16) participated in a 4-wave prospective questionnaire and observational study, with one year between measurements. in addition to self-report measures, adolescents were observed in real-time during conflicts with their partners. multilevel proportional hazard analyses revealed that, contrary to the hypothesis, conflict resolution and conflict recovery did not predict the likelihood of breakup. survival differences were not attributable to conflict resolution or conflict recovery. more research is needed to consider the unique relationship factors of adolescent romantic relationships to determine why some relationships survive while others do not.  preliminary psychometric data are presented for two inventories that assess conflict in couples. the ineffective arguing inventory (iai) is a self-report measure that assesses a dysfunctional style of couple conflict resolution. the conflict resolution style inventory (crsi) has complementary self-report and partner-report versions that assess four personal conflict resolution styles for each member of the couple. subjects were both partners of 75 gay, 51 lesbian, 108 married non-parent, and 99 married parent couples. findings for each inventory are presented regarding the factor structure of items, the internal consistency of composite scores, the 1-year stability of composite scores, the relation between couple members' composite scores, and the link between composite scores and relationship satisfaction, change in satisfaction, and relationship dissolution. generally, results warrant further examination of the iai and crsi as measures of conflict for couples. all couples have to deal with conflict. further, how that conflict is managed is linked to relationship satisfaction, change in relationship satisfaction, and relationship stability (gottman, 1994; heavey, layne, & christensen, 1993; markman, renick, floyd, stanley, & clements, 1993; noller & white, 1990). to date, perhaps the most productive method for studying relationship conflict has been to code videotapes of partner conversations for small samples of couples in a laboratory setting (e.g., gottman, 1994). without denying the value of these behavioral observations--in particular, for assessing sequences of couples' interactional styles during conflict--the present study is based on the premise that self-report and partner-report methodologies are also valuable ways to study couple conflict and may complement observational methodologies. one of the major limitations of observational studies of couple conflict is that they utilize very small, nonrepresentative samples. in fact, some of the inconsistent findings in observational studies regarding the types of conflict resolution strategies that are linked to declines in relationship satisfaction over time have been attributed to biased samples (gottman, 1993). the availability of psychometrically sound self-report and partner-report measures of conflict resolution would help address this limitation by providing researchers with one method by which the link between conflict resolution and both relationship maintenance and relationship dissolution could be studied in large, representative samples. some measures of couple conflict are available, including self-report measures of couple conflict resolution patterns (e.g., the problem-solving communication scale of the marital satisfaction inventory; snyder, 1981), self-report measures of individual conflict resolution styles (e.g., the marital coping inventory, bowman, 1990), and self-report and partner-report measures of each partner's conflict resolution styles (e.g., the interpersonal communication skills inventory; boyd & roach, 1977) as well as sequences of partners' conflict resolution styles (e.g., the communication patterns questionnaire; christensen, 1988). however, no measure of couple conflict resolution could be found that was brief, was based on a coherent conceptual framework, and had comprehensively documented psychometric properties. documenting psychometric properties include validating the measure against the major relationship outcomes used in behavioral observations in this area of study--relationship satisfaction, change in relationship satisfaction, and relationship stability (gottman, 1994; gottman & krokoff, 1989; markman et al., 1993). accordingly, the purpose of this article is to present such preliminary psychometric data for two brief nonobservational measures of couple conflict. the first measure--the ineffective arguing inventory (iai)--assesses how the couple handles conflict, whereas the second measure the conflict resolution styles inventory (crsi)--assesses each partner's individual style of handling conflict. …
a web-based business always wants to have the ability to track users’ browsing behavior history. this ability can be achieved by using web log mining technologies. in this paper, we introduce a self-organizing map (som) based approach to mining web log data. the som network maps the web pages into a two-dimensional map based on the users’ browsing history. web pages with the similar browsing patterns are clustered together. together with associate rules, the cluster generated by the som network has significant meaning to web browsing behavior. the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of this approach.  this article describes the implementation of a system that is able to organize vast document collections according to textual similarities. it is based on the self-organizing map (som) algorithm. as the feature vectors for the documents statistical representations of their vocabularies are used. the main goal in our work has been to scale up the som algorithm to be able to deal with large amounts of high-dimensional data. in a practical experiment we mapped 6,840,568 patent abstracts onto a 1,002,240-node som. as the feature vectors we used 500-dimensional vectors of stochastic figures obtained as random projections of weighted word histograms.

similarity-based search has been a key factor for many applications such as multimedia retrieval, data mining, web search and retrieval, and so on. there are two important issues related to the similarity search, namely, the design of a distance function to measure the similarity and improving the search efficiency. many distance functions have been proposed, which attempt to closely mimic human recognition. unfortunately, some of these well-designed distance functions do not follow the triangle inequality and are therefore nonmetric. as a consequence, efficient retrieval by using these nonmetric distance functions becomes more challenging, since most existing index structures assume that the indexed distance functions are metric. in this paper, we address this challenging problem by proposing an efficient method, that is, local constant embedding (lce), which divides the data set into disjoint groups so that the triangle inequality holds within each group by constant shifting. furthermore, we design a pivot selection approach for the converted metric distance and create an index structure to speed up the retrieval efficiency. moreover, we also propose a novel method to answer approximate similarity search in the nonmetric space with a guaranteed query accuracy. extensive experiments show that our method works well on various nonmetric distance functions and improves the retrieval efficiency by an order of magnitude compared to the linear scan and existing retrieval approaches with no false dismissals.  an important consideration in similarity-based retrieval of moving object trajectories is the definition of a distance function. the existing distance functions are usually sensitive to noise, shifts and scaling of data that commonly occur due to sensor failures, errors in detection techniques, disturbance signals, and different sampling rates. cleaning data to eliminate these is not always possible. in this paper, we introduce a novel distance function, edit distance on real sequence (edr) which is robust against these data imperfections. analysis and comparison of edr with other popular distance functions, such as euclidean distance, dynamic time warping (dtw), edit distance with real penalty (erp), and longest common subsequences (lcss), indicate that edr is more robust than euclidean distance, dtw and erp, and it is on average 50% more accurate than lcss. we also develop three pruning techniques to improve the retrieval efficiency of edr and show that these techniques can be combined effectively in a search, increasing the pruning power significantly. the experimental results confirm the superior efficiency of the combined methods.
the soil bacterium bacillus subtilis frequently encounters a reduction in temperature in its natural habitats. here, a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach has been used to analyse the adaptational responses of b. subtilis to low temperature. propagation of b. subtilis in minimal medium at 15 degrees c triggered the induction of 279 genes and the repression of 301 genes in comparison to cells grown at 37 degrees c. the analysis thus revealed profound adjustments in the overall gene expression profile in chill-adapted cells. important transcriptional changes in low-temperature-grown cells comprise the induction of the sigb-controlled general stress regulon, the induction of parts of the early sporulation regulons (sigf, sige and sigg) and the induction of a regulatory circuit (rapa/phra and opp) that is involved in the fine-tuning of the phosphorylation status of the spo0a response regulator. the analysis of chill-stress-repressed genes revealed reductions in major catabolic (glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, atp synthesis) and anabolic routes (biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, haem and fatty acids) that likely reflect the slower growth rates at low temperature. low-temperature repression of part of the sigw regulon and of many genes with predicted functions in chemotaxis and motility was also noted. the proteome analysis of chill-adapted cells indicates a major contribution of post-transcriptional regulation phenomena in adaptation to low temperature. comparative analysis of the previously reported transcriptional responses of cold-shocked b. subtilis cells with this data revealed that cold shock and growth in the cold constitute physiologically distinct phases of the adaptation of b. subtilis to low temperature.  the alternative sigma factor sigmab of bacillus subtilis is required for the induction of approximately 100 genes after the imposition of a whole range of stresses and energy limitation. in this study, we investigated the impact of a null mutation in sigb on the stress and starvation survival of b. subtilis. sigb mutants which failed to induce the regulon following stress displayed an at least 50- to 100-fold decrease in survival of severe heat (54 degrees c) or ethanol (9%) shock, salt (10%) stress, and acid (ph 4.3) stress, as well as freezing and desiccation, compared to the wild type. preloading cells with sigmab-dependent general stress proteins prior to growth-inhibiting stress conferred considerable protection against heat and salt. exhaustion of glucose or phosphate induced the sigmab response, but surprisingly, sigmab did not seem to be required for starvation survival. starved wild-type cells exhibited about 10-fold greater resistance to salt stress than exponentially growing cells. the data argue that the expression of sigmab-dependent genes provides nonsporulated b. subtilis cells with a nonspecific multiple stress resistance that may be relevant for stress survival in the natural ecosystem.
•  atp transfer from mitochondria to the cytoplasm occurs mainly through phosphate transfer to creatine by mitochondrial creatine kinase (mick) but also by transport and/or diffusion of adp and atp through specific mitochondrial transport protein complexes. •  determining the effect of exercise on phosphate shuttling may require contractile signals in situ and varying creatine concentrations to alter mick activity. •  mitochondrial respiratory sensitivity to adp was assessed in permeabilized muscle fibre bundles (pmfbs) before and after 2 h cycling exercise in human skeletal muscle. •  in relaxed pmfbs, adp sensitivity decreased post‐exercise when mick phosphate shuttling was low (no creatine) with no change in net adp sensitivity in the presence of creatine, whereas in contracting fibres post‐exercise adp sensitivity was higher with creatine. •  this shows mick activity is increased post‐exercise, especially during contraction in pmfbs, and suggests exercise regulates phosphate shuttling, which would improve maintenance of energy homeostasis during contraction.  the hypothesis that the aging process is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress has been investigated in human skeletal muscle. muscle biopsy samples were taken from seven old male subjects [os; 75 (range 61–86) years] and eight young male subjects [ys; 25 (22–31) years]. oxidative function was measured both in permeabilised muscle fibres and isolated mitochondria. despite matching the degree of physical activity, os had a lower training status than ys as judged from pulmonary maximal o2 consumption (v̇o2max, −36%) and handgrip strength (−20%). both maximal respiration and creatine-stimulated respiration were reduced in muscle fibres from os (−32 and −34%, respectively). in contrast, respiration in isolated mitochondria was similar in os and ys. the discrepancy might be explained by a biased harvest of "healthy" mitochondria and/or disruption of structural components during the process of isolation. cytochrome c oxidase was reduced (−40%, p<0.01), whereas ucp3 protein tended to be elevated in os (p=0.09). generation of reactive oxygen species by isolated mitochondria and measures of antioxidative defence (muscle content of glutathione, glutathione redox status, antioxidative enzymes activity) were not significantly different between os and ys. it is concluded that aging is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, which appears to be unrelated to reduced physical activity. the hypothesis of increased oxidative stress in aged muscle could not be confirmed in this study.
mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb) is known to produce wax esters (we) when subjected to stress. however, nothing is known about the enzymes involved in biosynthesis of we and their role in mycobacterial dormancy. we report that two putative mtb fatty acyl-coa reductase genes (fcr) expressed in e. coli display catalytic reduction of fatty acyl-coa to fatty aldehyde and fatty alcohol. both enzymes (fcr1/rv3391) and fcr2/rv1543) showed a requirement for nadph as the reductant, a preference for oleoyl-coa over saturated fatty acyl-coa and were inhibited by thiol-directed reagents. we generated mtb gene-knockout mutants for each reductase. metabolic incorporation of 14c-oleate into fatty alcohols and we was severely diminished in the mutants under dormancy-inducing stress conditions that are thought to be encountered by the pathogen in the host. the fatty acyl-coa reductase activity in cell lysates of the mutants under nitric oxide stress was significantly reduced when compared with the wild type. complementation restored the lost activity completely in the δfcr1 mutant and partially in the δfcr2 mutant. we synthesis was inhibited in both δfcr mutants. the δfcr mutants exhibited faster growth rates, an increased uptake of 14c-glycerol suggesting increased permeability of the cell wall, increased metabolic activity levels and impaired phenotypic antibiotic tolerance under dormancy-inducing combined multiple stress conditions. complementation of the mutants did not restore the development of antibiotic tolerance to wild-type levels. transcript analysis of δfcr mutants showed upregulation of genes involved in energy generation and transcription, indicating the inability of the mutants to become dormant. our results indicate that the fcr1 and fcr2 gene products are involved in we synthesis under in vitro dormancy-inducing conditions and that we play a critical role in reaching a dormant state. drugs targeted against the mtb reductases may inhibit its ability to go into dormancy and therefore increase susceptibility of mtb to currently used antibiotics thereby enhancing clearance of the pathogen from patients.  the search for new tb drugs that rapidly and effectively sterilize the tissues and are thus able to shorten the duration of chemotherapy from the current 6 months has been hampered by a lack of understanding of the metabolism of the bacterium when in a ‘persistent’ or latent form. little is known about the condition in which the bacilli survive, although laboratory models have shown that mycobacterium tuberculosis can exist in a non‐growing, drug‐resistant state that may mimic persistence in vivo. using nutrient starvation, we have established a model in which m. tuberculosis arrests growth, decreases its respiration rate and is resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin and metronidazole. we have used microarray and proteome analysis to investigate the response of m. tuberculosis to nutrient starvation. proteome analysis of 6‐week‐starved cultures revealed the induction of several proteins. microarray analysis enabled us to monitor gene expression during adaptation to nutrient starvation and confirmed the changes seen at the protein level. this has provided evidence for slowdown of the transcription apparatus, energy metabolism, lipid biosynthesis and cell division in addition to induction of the stringent response and several other genes that may play a role in maintaining long‐term survival within the host. thus, we have generated a model with which we can search for agents active against persistent m. tuberculosis and revealed a number of potential targets expressed under these conditions.
backgroundv(d)j recombination is initiated in antigen receptor loci by the pairwise cleavage of recombination signal sequences (rsss) by the rag1 and rag2 proteins via a nick-hairpin mechanism. the rss contains highly conserved heptamer (consensus: 5'-cacagtg) and nonamer (consensus: 5'-acaaaaacc) motifs separated by either 12- or 23-base pairs of poorly conserved sequence. the high mobility group proteins hmgb1 and hmgb2 (hmgb1/2) are highly abundant architectural dna binding proteins known to promote rag-mediated synapsis and cleavage of consensus recombination signals in vitro by facilitating rss binding and bending by the rag1/2 complex. hmgb1/2 are known to recognize distorted dna structures such as four-way junctions, and damaged or modified dna. whether hmgb1/2 can promote rag-mediated dna cleavage at sites lacking a canonical rss by targeting or stabilizing structural distortions is unclear, but is important for understanding the etiology of chromosomal translocations involving antigen receptor genes and proto-oncogene sequences that do not contain an obvious rss-like element.resultshere we identify a novel dna breakpoint site in the plasmid v(d)j recombination substrate pgg49 (bps6197) that is cleaved by the rag proteins via a nick-hairpin mechanism. the bps6197 sequence lacks a recognizable heptamer at the breakpoint (5'-cctgacg-3') but contains a nonamer-like element (5'-acattaacc-3') 30 base pairs from the cleavage site. we find that rag-mediated bps6197 cleavage is promoted by hmgb1/2, requiring both hmg-box domains to be intact to facilitate rag-mediated cleavage, and is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-rss. a dyad-symmetric inverted repeat sequence lying 5' to the breakpoint is implicated as a target for hmgb1/2 activity.conclusionwe have identified a novel dna sequence, called bps6197, that supports standard v(d)j-type cleavage despite the absence of an apparent heptamer motif. efficient rag-mediated bps6197 cleavage requires the presence of hmgb1/2, is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-rss partner, and is directed in part by an inverted repeat sequence adjacent to the dna cleavage site. these results have important implications for understanding how the rag proteins can introduce a dna double-strand break at dna sequences that do not contain an obvious heptamer-like motif.  v(d)j recombination is a process integral to lymphocyte development. however, this process is not always benign, since certain lymphoid malignancies exhibit recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations and deletions, that harbor molecular signatures suggesting an origin from aberrant v(d)j recombination. translocations involving lmo2, tal1, ttg-1, and hox11, as well as a recurrent interstitial deletion at 1p32 involving sil/scl, are cited examples of illegitimate v(d)j recombination. previous studies using extrachromosomal substrates reveal that cryptic recombination signal sequences (crsss) identified near the translocation breakpoint in these examples support v(d)j recombination with efficiencies ranging from about 30- to 20,000-fold less than bona fide v(d)j recombination signals. to understand the molecular basis for these large differences, we investigated the binding and cleavage of these crsss by the rag1/2 proteins that initiate v(d)j recombination. we find that the rag proteins comparably bind all crsss tested, albeit more poorly than a consensus rss. we show that four crsss that support levels of v(d)j recombination above background levels in cell culture (lmo2, tal1, ttg-1, and sil) are also cleaved by the rag proteins in vitro with efficiencies ranging from 18 to 70% of a consensus rss. cleavage of lmo2 and ttg-1 by the rag proteins can also be detected in cell culture using ligation-mediated pcr. in contrast, hox11 and scl are nicked but not cleaved efficiently in vitro, and cleavage at other adventitious sites in plasmid substrates may also limit the ability to detect recombination activity at these crsss in cell culture.
distiller's grains and solubles (dgs) is the major co-product of corn dry mill ethanol production, and is composed of 30% protein and 30-40% polysaccharides. we report a strategy for simultaneous extraction of protein with food-grade biobased solvents (ethyl lactate, d-limonene, and distilled methyl esters) and enzymatic saccharification of glucan in dgs. this approach would produce a high-value animal feed while simultaneously producing additional sugars for ethanol production. preliminary experiments on protein extraction resulted in recovery of 15-45% of the protein, with hydrophobic biobased solvents obtaining the best results. the integrated hydrolysis and extraction experiments showed that biobased solvent addition did not inhibit hydrolysis of the cellulose. however, only 25-33% of the total protein was extracted from dgs, and the extracted protein largely resided in the aqueous phase, not the solvent phase. we hypothesize that the hydrophobic solvent could not access the proteins surrounded by the aqueous phase inside the fibrous structure of dgs due to poor mass transfer. further process improvements are needed to overcome this obstacle.  ddgs and wet distillers' grains are the major co-products of the dry grind ethanol facilities. as they are mainly used as animal feed, a typical compositional analysis of the ddgs and wet distillers' grains mainly focuses on defining the feedstock's nutritional characteristics. with an increasing demand for fuel ethanol, the ddgs and wet distillers' grains are viewed as a potential bridge feedstock for ethanol production from other cellulosic biomass. the introduction of ddgs or wet distillers' grains as an additional feed to the existing dry grind plants for increased ethanol yield requires a different approach to the compositional analysis of the material. rather than focusing on its nutritional value, this new approach aims at determining more detailed chemical composition, especially on polymeric sugars such as cellulose, starch and xylan, which release fermentable sugars upon enzymatic hydrolysis. in this paper we present a detailed and complete compositional analysis procedure suggested for ddgs and wet distillers' grains, as well as the resulting compositions completed by three different research groups. polymeric sugars, crude protein, crude oil and ash contents of ddgs and wet distillers' grains were accurately and reproducibly determined by the compositional analysis procedure described in this paper.
purpose current trends suggest that adolescents and young adults typically maintain a social media "portfolio" of several sites including facebook and twitter, but little is known regarding how an individual chooses to display risk behaviors across these different sites. the purpose of this study was to investigate college students' displayed alcohol references on both facebook and twitter.   methods among a larger sample of college students from two universities, we identified participants who maintained both facebook and twitter profiles. data collection included evaluation of 5 months of participants' facebook and twitter posts for alcohol references, number of social connections (i.e., friends or followers), and number of posts. phone interviews assessed participants' frequency of facebook and twitter use and self-reported alcohol use. analyses included fisher's exact test, wilcoxon matched pair sign test, friedman rank-sum tests, and logistic regression.   results of 112 eligible participants, 94 completed the study. participants were more likely to display alcohol references on facebook compared with those on twitter (76% vs. 34%, p = .02). participants reported more social connections on facebook versus twitter (average 801.2 friends vs. 189.4 followers, p < .001) and were more likely to report daily use of facebook versus twitter (94.6% vs. 50%, p < .001). current alcohol use was predictive of both facebook and twitter displayed alcohol references, but mediators differed in each model.   conclusions college students were more likely to display alcohol references on facebook compared with those on twitter. understanding these patterns and predictors may inform prevention and intervention efforts directed at particular social media sites.  objectives. underage drinking contributes to the 3 leading causes of death (unintentional injury, homicide, and suicide) among persons aged 12 to 20 years. most adverse health effects from underage drinking stem from acute intoxication resulting from binge drinking. although binge drinking, typically defined as consuming ≥5 drinks on an occasion, is a common pattern of alcohol consumption among youth, few population-based studies have focused specifically on the characteristics of underage binge drinkers and their associated health risk behaviors. methods. we analyzed data on current drinking, binge drinking, and other health risk behaviors from the 2003 national youth risk behavior survey. prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by using sas and sudaan statistical software. logistic regression was used to examine the associations between different patterns of alcohol consumption and health risk behaviors. results. overall, 44.9% of high school students reported drinking alcohol during the past 30 days (28.8% binge drank and 16.1% drank alcohol but did not binge drink). although girls reported more current drinking with no binge drinking, binge-drinking rates were similar among boys and girls. binge-drinking rates increased with age and school grade. students who binge drank were more likely than both nondrinkers and current drinkers who did not binge to report poor school performance and involvement in other health risk behaviors such as riding with a driver who had been drinking, being currently sexually active, smoking cigarettes or cigars, being a victim of dating violence, attempting suicide, and using illicit drugs. a strong dose-response relationship was found between the frequency of binge drinking and the prevalence of other health risk behaviors. conclusions. binge drinking is the most common pattern of alcohol consumption among high school youth who drink alcohol and is strongly associated with a wide range of other health risk behaviors. effective intervention strategies (eg, enforcement of the minimum legal drinking age, screening and brief intervention, and increasing alcohol taxes) should be implemented to prevent underage alcohol consumption and adverse health and social consequences resulting from this behavior.
objectivethe study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of the gentamycin collagen sponge placed in the pelvic cavity after excision of rectal cancer in view of postoperative complications and the risk of cancer recurrence.methodsa total of 229 patients were recruited into the study and randomized into two groups: grm(+), in which a gentamycin collagen sponge was used, and grm(−), without the sponge. tumors were resected using a tme technique. in the grm(+) group, the sponge was placed into the tumor bed.resultsanalysis covered 218 patients for whom all follow-up data were available. there were fewer early postoperative complications in the grm(+) group: 20.7 vs. 37.5%; p=0.044. this effect was found mainly in patients with surgery lasting longer than 3 h. after 36 months’ follow-up, the overall survival after r0 resection for the grm(+) and grm(−) groups was: 88.66 vs. 73.96%. there was significant reduction in the distant metastasis rate in favor of the grm(+) group.conclusionthe use of the gentamycin collagen sponge after excision of rectal cancer is safe and reduces the rate of early postoperative complications. the reasons for the lower rate of distant metastasis in the grm(+) group are not clear, but the patients enjoy significant survival benefits.  over 14 years 276 patients with rectal cancer underwent surgery; 219 who underwent low anterior resection of the rectum with total mesorectal excision were studied. there were 24 (11·0 per cent) major anastomotic leaks associated with peritonitis or a pelvic collection and 14 (6·4 per cent) minor leaks that were asymptomatic and detected by contrast enema. all major leaks occurred at an anastomotic height of less than 6cm (p = 0·08). the abdominoperineal excision rate was 9·1 per cent. major leaks were associated with failure to defunction in 11 of 62 patients and with a defunctioning colostomy in 13 of 157 (p = 0·03). of the 24 patients with major leaks seven developed peritonitis, one with a defunctioned anastomosis (p = 0·002), and three died (p = 0·02). use of the sigmoid colon led to major leakage in seven of 32 patients compared with 17 of 187 when the splenic flexure was employed (p = 0·05). there was no increase in the local recurrence rate but only nine patients with major leakage and a temporary stoma have had these closed. key technical factors incude: a clean dry pelvie cavity, pulsatile colonic blood supply, suction drainage started during closure and mobilization of ample tissue to fill the pelvic space.
the rop16 kinase of toxoplasma gondii is injected into the host cell cytosol where it activates signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat)-3 and stat6. here, we generated a rop16 deletion mutant on a type i parasite strain background, as well as a control complementation mutant with restored rop16 expression. we investigated the biological role of the rop16 molecule during t. gondii infection. infection of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages with rop16-deleted (δrop16) parasites resulted in increased amounts of il-12p40 production relative to the rop16-positive rh parental strain. high level il-12p40 production in δrop16 infection was dependent on the host cell adaptor molecule myd88, but surprisingly was independent of any previously recognized t. gondii triggered pathway linking to myd88 (tlr2, tlr4, tlr9, tlr11, il-1ß and il-18). in addition, rop16 was found to mediate the suppressive effects of toxoplasma on lps-induced cytokine synthesis in macrophages and on ifn-γ-induced nitric oxide production by astrocytes and microglial cells. furthermore, rop16 triggered synthesis of host cell arginase-1 in a stat6-dependent manner. in fibroblasts and macrophages, failure to induce arginase-1 by δrop16 tachyzoites resulted in resistance to starvation conditions of limiting arginine, an essential amino acid for replication and virulence of this parasite. δrop16 tachyzoites that failed to induce host cell arginase-1 displayed increased replication and dissemination during in vivo infection. we conclude that encounter between toxoplasma rop16 and the host cell stat signaling cascade has pleiotropic downstream effects that act in multiple and complex ways to direct the course of infection.  backgroundbrain inflammation plays a central role in multiple sclerosis (ms). dimethylfumarate (dmf), the main ingredient of an oral formulation of fumaric acid esters with proven therapeutic efficacy in psoriasis, has recently been found to ameliorate the course of relapsing-remitting ms. glial cells are the effector cells of neuroinflammation; however, little is known of the effect of dmf on microglia and astrocytes. the purpose of this study was to use an established in vitro model of brain inflammation to determine if dmf modulates the release of neurotoxic molecules from microglia and astrocytes, thus inhibiting glial inflammation.methodsprimary microglial and astrocytic cell cultures were prepared from cerebral cortices of neonatal rats. the control cells were treated with lps, an accepted inducer of pro-inflammatory properties in glial cells, and the experimental groups with lps and dmf in different concentrations. after stimulation/incubation, the generation of nitric oxide (no) in the cell culture supernatants was determined by measuring nitrite accumulation in the medium using griess reagent. after 6 hours of treatment rt-pcr was used to determine transcription levels of inos, il-1β, il-6 and tnf-α mrna in microglial and astrocytic cell cultures initially treated with dmf, followed after 30 min by lps treatment. moreover, we investigated possible involvement of the erk and nrf-2 transduction pathway in microglia using western blot analysis.resultspretreatment with dmf decreased synthesis of the proinflammatory mediators inos, tnf-α, il-1β and il-6 at the rna level in activated microglia and astrocytes in vitro, associated with a decrease in erk phosphorylation in microglia.conclusionscollectively, these results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of dmf may be in part functionally attributable to the compound's ability to inhibit expression of multiple neuroinflammatory mediators in brain of ms patients.
callogenesis, somatic embryogenesis, and regeneration were obtained from tissues of unfertilized ovaries of sweet orange (citrus sinensis osbeck.) cv. tobias. the influence of two modified basal media, woody plant medium (wpm) and n6 medium, to induce callus formation from pistils was determined. overall, high frequencies of callogenesis were observed when either medium was used. however, initial culture of explants in wpm medium followed by transfer of callus to n6 medium resulted in higher frequency of callus induction (of 2.30 callus per explant that were larger than 0.5 cm in size), and of subsequent development of embryogenic callus (10%). a total of 125 somatic embryos were obtained. after 6 months of culture, 72% of somatic embryos germinated into plantlets. these plantlets were subsequently micrografted in vitro, and then acclimatized. ploidy of these plants were determined using flow cytometry and traps molecular markers were used to confirm their maternal origin.  an improvement of the protocol for haploid induction through anther culture of citrus clementina hort. ex tan. cv. nules was achieved following the evaluation of a number of the factors affecting androgenesis. the influence of thidiazuron (tdz) and three temperature pre-treatments (4°c, 25°c, 32°c) on the floral buds with respect to anther culture of c. clementina hort. ex tan., cv. nules was investigated. an increased embryoid production was induced in the medium supplemented with tdz. pre-treatment temperatures of 4°c and 25°c were more favorable for embryo production than 32°c. regeneration of androgenic haploid plantlets from cv. sra 63 of c. clementina is reported here for the first time.
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is a second messenger generated by stimulation of the phosphoinositide cycle, thought to release calcium from intracellular stores. we have mapped the distribution of 3h- inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor binding sites in rat brain by autoradiographic techniques. the cerebellum contains the highest level of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding sites in brain, which appear to be selectively localized to purkinje cells. moderate levels of binding sites are present in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, caudate, and substantia nigra. lesion studies indicate that binding in the hippocampus is restricted to intrinsic neuronal elements and in the nigra is found on terminals of the striatonigral projection. overall, the autoradiographic distribution of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors resembles the distribution of phorbol ester binding sites associated with protein kinase c. however, the inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate receptor has a more restricted distribution since it is not detectable in the spinal cord or olfactory bulb, regions with substantial levels of protein kinase c.  protein kinase c is a calcium- and phospholipid-stimulated enzyme present in high concentration in the brain. phorbol esters are potent tumor promoters that bind to specific receptors with high affinity. several lines of evidence indicate that the phorbol ester receptor is identical to protein kinase c. to determine the distribution of protein kinase c, we have localized phorbol ester receptors in the rat brain by autoradiography, using [3h]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3h]pdbu) and have performed a variety of lesions to assess the nature of the cellular elements possessing the binding sites. the [3h]pdbu binding sites in the rat brain are discretely localized and primarily associated with neurons. evidence is presented for localization to intrinsic neurons of the cortex and hippocampus, terminals of the striatonigral projection, a projection to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, and to dendrites of purkinje cells.
the distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (dios), previously known as meconium ileus equivalent (mie), is a condition unique to cystic fibrosis (cf). the syndrome is relatively common, occurring in about 10-22% of patients (rubinstein et al, 1986; penketh et al, 1987; davidson et al, 1987; dray et al, 2004). it may present at any time after the neonatal period but the incidence increases with age and it is more common in adolescent and adult patients. about 80% of cases present for the first time in adults. the recurrence rate is approximately 50%. treatment of distal intestinal obstruction syndrome is easily misdiagnosed by those who are not familiar with the condition. it has not been described in other forms of pancreatic insufficiency but it has been reported in patients with cystic fibrosis who are pancreatic sufficient and have normal fat absorption (davidson et al, 1987; millar-jones et al, 1995).  intestinal disease in cystic fibrosis (cf) mice closely mirrors aspects of obstructive syndromes in cf patients. the pathogenesis involves accumulation of mucoid debris in the crypts that fuse with intestinal content to form obstructing mucofeculant impactions. treatment involves modalities that increase the fluidity of the luminal content, such as osmotic laxatives and liquid diets. we investigated the effects of talniflumate (lomucin, genaera corporation, plymouth meeting, pa), a compound that may be beneficial to treatment of cf intestinal disease based on three mechanisms of action: mucus synthesis inhibition by blockade of the murine calcium-activated chloride channel 3 (mclca3), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory effects, and inhibition of cl–/hco –3 exchanger(s) involved in intestinal nacl absorption. cohorts of cf mice were fed control diet or diets containing either talniflumate (0.4 mg/g chow) or ibuprofen (0.4 mg/g chow) for 21 days to assess survival. talniflumate significantly increased cf mouse survival from 26 to 77%, whereas ibuprofen had no effect (22% survival). oral talniflumate did not alter crypt goblet cell numbers or change intestinal expression of mclca3 but tended to decrease crypt mucoid impaction. ussing chamber studies indicated that talniflumate slightly increased the basal short-circuit current of cf intestine, but the change was not sensitive to secretagogue stimulation or bumetanide inhibition. in contrast, intracellular ph measurements of intact intestinal villous epithelium indicated that talniflumate significantly inhibited apical membrane cl–/hco –3 exchange by >50%. we conclude that oral talniflumate increases the survival of cf mice, possibly by the beneficial effects of decreasing small intestinal nacl absorption through the inhibition of apical membrane cl–/hco –3 exchanger(s).
spherical deconvolution (sd) is commonly used for estimating fiber orientation distribution functions (fodfs) from diffusion-weighted signals. existing sd methods can be classified into two categories: 1) continuous representation based sd (cr-sd), where typically spherical harmonic (sh) representation is used for convenient analytical solutions, and 2) discrete representation based sd (dr-sd), where the signal profile is represented by a discrete set of basis functions uniformly oriented on the unit sphere. a feasible fodf should be non-negative and should integrate to unity throughout the unit sphere s(2). however, to our knowledge, most existing sh-based sd methods enforce non-negativity only on discretized points and not the whole continuum of s(2). maximum entropy sd (mesd) and cartesian tensor fiber orientation distributions (ct-fod) are the only sd methods that ensure non-negativity throughout the unit sphere. they are however computational intensive and are susceptible to errors caused by numerical spherical integration. existing sd methods are also known to overestimate the number of fiber directions, especially in regions with low anisotropy. dr-sd introduces additional error in peak detection owing to the angular discretization of the unit sphere. this paper proposes a sd framework, called non-negative sd (nnsd), to overcome all the limitations above. nnsd is significantly less susceptible to the false-positive peaks, uses sh representation for efficient analytical spherical deconvolution, and allows accurate peak detection throughout the whole unit sphere. we further show that nnsd and most existing sd methods can be extended to work on multi-shell data by introducing a three-dimensional fiber response function. we evaluated nnsd in comparison with constrained sd (csd), a quadratic programming variant of csd, mesd, and an l1-norm regularized non-negative least-squares dr-sd. experiments on synthetic and real single-/multi-shell data indicate that nnsd improves estimation performance in terms of mean difference of angles, peak detection consistency, and anisotropy contrast between isotropic and anisotropic regions.  we present a method for the estimation of various features of the tissue micro-architecture using the diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. the considered features are designed from the displacement probability density function (pdf). the estimation is based on two steps: first the approximation of the signal by a series expansion made of gaussian-laguerre and spherical harmonics functions; followed by a projection on a finite dimensional space. besides, we propose to tackle the problem of the robustness to rician noise corrupting in-vivo acquisitions. our feature estimation is expressed as a variational minimization process leading to a variational framework which is robust to noise. this approach is very flexible regarding the number of samples and enables the computation of a large set of various features of the local tissues structure. we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with results on both synthetic phantom and real mr datasets acquired in a clinical time-frame.
significance traf6 is essential for many biological processes, including the operation of the innate immune system and bone formation. the enzymatic activity of traf6, an e3 ubiquitin ligase, is thought to have a pivotal role in triggering these processes. in this paper, we reexamined this assumption by generating mice expressing a catalytically inactive mutant of traf6. the bone structure of the mice was normal and a major intracellular signaling pathway of the immune system could still be switched on. we found that other e3 ligases, pellino1 and pellino2, could generate the ubiquitin chains needed to switch on immune signaling in human cells expressing catalytically inactive traf6. our findings identify essential roles of traf6 that are independent of its enzymatic activity. it is widely accepted that the essential role of traf6 in vivo is to generate the lys63-linked ubiquitin (k63-ub) chains needed to activate the “master” protein kinase tak1. here, we report that traf6 e3 ligase activity contributes to but is not essential for the il-1–dependent formation of k63-ub chains, tak1 activation, or il-8 production in human cells, because pellino1 and pellino2 generate the k63-ub chains required for signaling in cells expressing e3 ligase-inactive traf6 mutants. the il-1–induced formation of k63-ub chains and ubiquitylation of irak1, irak4, and myd88 was abolished in traf6/pellino1/pellino2 triple-knockout (ko) cells, but not in traf6 ko or pellino1/2 double-ko cells. the reexpression of e3 ligase-inactive traf6 mutants partially restored il-1 signaling in traf6 ko cells, but not in traf6/pellino1/pellino2 triple-ko cells. pellino1-generated k63-ub chains activated the tak1 complex in vitro with similar efficiently to traf6-generated k63-ub chains. the early phase of tlr signaling and the tlr-dependent secretion of il-10 (controlled by iraks 1 and 2) was only reduced modestly in primary macrophages from knockin mice expressing the e3 ligase-inactive traf6[l74h] mutant, but the late-phase production of il-6, il-12, and tnfα (controlled only by the pseudokinase irak2) was abolished. rankl-induced signaling in macrophages and the differentiation of bone marrow to osteoclasts was similar in traf6[l74h] and wild-type cells, explaining why the bone structure and teeth of the traf6[l74h] mice was normal, unlike traf6 ko mice. we identify two essential roles of traf6 that are independent of its e3 ligase activity.  tumor necrosis factor (tnf) receptor–associated factor (traf)-6 mediates lys63-linked polyubiquitination for nf-κb activation via its n-terminal ring and zinc finger domains. here we report the crystal structures of traf6 and its complex with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e2) ubc13. the ring and zinc fingers of traf6 assume a rigid, elongated structure. interaction of traf6 with ubc13 involves direct contacts of the ring and the preceding residues, and the first zinc finger has a structural role. unexpectedly, this region of traf6 is dimeric both in the crystal and in solution, different from the trimeric c-terminal traf domain. structure-based mutagenesis reveals that traf6 dimerization is crucial for polyubiquitin synthesis and autoubiquitination. fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis shows that traf6 dimerization induces higher-order oligomerization of full-length traf6. the mismatch of dimeric and trimeric symmetry may provide a mode of infinite oligomerization that facilitates ligand-dependent signal transduction of many immune receptors.
wireless technology is now an integral part of communication network infrastructure. from their first beginnings, such as connection-oriented general system mobile networks for voice traffic only and connectionless wireless local area networks for data traffic, new generation wireless networks are connection-oriented and provide differentiated services to the user. with the arrival of more sophisticated services and mobility, have arisen the need for connection admission control and traffic scheduling in the network to enhance the quality of experience (qoe) of the user and optimizing the revenue in dynamic workload environments. a great deal of research effort has gone into the study of the performance of one such network standard, namely the ieee 802.16 networks. most optimization studies focus on scheduling (a very mature subject in computing) and ignore connection admission (a very mature subject in telephone engineering) or vice versa. in this paper we claim that one should not study the two in isolation and provide empirical evidence to prove our claim.  in this study, we approach systems from an information theoretical perspective. specifically, we propose a framework to model systems by noisy communication channels and analyze them by this framework whose elements are commonly used analysis tools in science and engineering. a noisy communication channel model is a mechanism that accepts a set of inputs and yields a set of outputs. the formal mechanisms to exploit the relationships in the proposed framework include fourier series, uniform polygons, roots of unity, special permutations and polynomials. these formal mechanisms make the framework more powerful by enabling it to connect common analysis tools provided in complex analysis and graph theory.
mathematical modeling is an indispensable tool for research and development in biotechnology and bioengineering. the formulation of kinetic models of biochemical networks depends on knowledge of the kinetic properties of the enzymes of the individual reactions. however, kinetic data acquired from experimental observations bring along uncertainties due to various experimental conditions and measurement methods. in this contribution, we propose a novel way to model the uncertainty in the enzyme kinetics and to predict quantitatively the responses of metabolic reactions to the changes in enzyme activities under uncertainty. the proposed methodology accounts explicitly for mechanistic properties of enzymes and physico‐chemical and thermodynamic constraints, and is based on formalism from systems theory and metabolic control analysis. we achieve this by observing that kinetic responses of metabolic reactions depend: (i) on the distribution of the enzymes among their free form and all reactive states; (ii) on the equilibrium displacements of the overall reaction and that of the individual enzymatic steps; and (iii) on the net fluxes through the enzyme. relying on this observation, we develop a novel, efficient monte carlo sampling procedure to generate all states within a metabolic reaction that satisfy imposed constrains. thus, we derive the statistics of the expected responses of the metabolic reactions to changes in enzyme levels and activities, in the levels of metabolites, and in the values of the kinetic parameters. we present aspects of the proposed framework through an example of the fundamental three‐step reversible enzymatic reaction mechanism. we demonstrate that the equilibrium displacements of the individual enzymatic steps have an important influence on kinetic responses of the enzyme. furthermore, we derive the conditions that must be satisfied by a reversible three‐step enzymatic reaction operating far away from the equilibrium in order to respond to changes in metabolite levels according to the irreversible michelis–menten kinetics. the efficient sampling procedure allows easy, scalable, implementation of this methodology to modeling of large‐scale biochemical networks. biotechnol. bioeng. 2011;108: 413–423. © 2010 wiley periodicals, inc.  introduction fundamentals of biochemical modeling balance equations rate laws generalized mass-action kinetics various enzyme kinetic rate laws thermodynamic flow-force relationships power-law approximation steady states of biochemical networks general considerations stable and unstable steady states multiple steady states metabolic oscillations background mathematical conditions for oscillations glycolytic oscillations models of intracellular calcium oscillations a simple three-variable model with only monomolecular and bimolecular reactions possible physiological significance of oscillations stoichiometric analysis conservation relations linear dependencies between the rows of the stoichiometry matrix non-negative flux vectors elementary flux modes thermodynamic aspects a generalized wegscheider condition strictly detailed balanced subnetworks onsager's reciprocity reactions for coupled enyme reactions time hierarchy in metabolism time constants the quasi-steady-state approximation the rapid equilibrium approximation modal analysis metabolic control analysis basic definitions a systematic approach theorems of metabolic control analysis summation theorems connectivity theorems calculation of control coefficients using the theorems geometrical interpretation control analysis of various systems general remarks elasticity coefficients for specific rate laws control coefficients for simple hypothetical pathways unbranched chains a branched system control of erythrocyte energy metabolism the reaction system basic model interplay of atp production and atp consumption glycolytic energy metabolism and osmotic states a simple model of oxidative phosphorylation a three-step model of serine biosynthesis time-dependent control coefficients are control coefficients always parameter independent?

hart, cef and tracy, bl. yoga as steadiness training: effects on motor variability in young adults. j strength cond res 22(5): 1659-1669, 2008-exercise training programs can increase strength and improve submaximal force control, but the effects of yoga as an alternative form of steadiness training are not well described. the purpose was to explore the effect of a popular type of yoga (bikram) on strength, steadiness, and balance. young adults performed yoga training (n = 10, 29 ± 6 years, 24 yoga sessions in 8 weeks) or served as controls (n = 11, 26 ± 7 years). yoga sessions consisted of 1.5 hours of supervised, standardized postures. measures before and after training included maximum voluntary contraction (mvc) force of the elbow flexors (ef) and knee extensors (ke), steadiness of isometric ef and ke contractions, steadiness of concentric (con) and eccentric (ecc) ke contractions, and timed balance. the standard deviation (sd) and coefficient of variation (cv, sd/mean force) of isometric force and the sd of acceleration during con and ecc contractions were measured. after yoga training, mvc force increased 14% for ke (479 ± 175 to 544 ± 187 n, p < 0.05) and was unchanged for the ef muscles (219 ± 85 to 230 ± 72 n, p > 0.05). the cv of force was unchanged for ef (1.68 to 1.73%, p > 0.05) but was reduced in the ke muscles similarly for yoga and control groups (2.04 to 1.55%, p < 0.05). the variability of con and ecc contractions was unchanged. for the yoga group, improvement in ke steadiness was correlated with pretraining steadiness (r = −0.62 to −0.84, p < 0.05); subjects with the greatest ke force fluctuations before training experienced the greatest reductions with training. percent change in balance time for individual yoga subjects averaged +228% (19.5 ± 14 to 34.3 ± 18 seconds, p < 0.05), with no change in controls. for young adults, a short-term yoga program of this type can improve balance substantially, produce modest improvements in leg strength, and improve leg muscle control for less-steady subjects.  purpose to determine the contribution of visuomotor correction to increased force fluctuations in the elbow flexor and knee extensor muscles of elderly adults.   methods young (n = 22, 23 +/- 3 yr) and elderly (n = 23, 74 +/- 7 yr) adults performed constant-force contractions at target forces of 2.5, 30, and 65% mvc. visual feedback was provided (6-8 s) and then removed (6-8 s). after removal of drift (< 0.5 hz) from the force, the standard deviation (sd) and coefficient of variation (cv) of force were calculated from vision and no-vision data.   results maximal voluntary contraction (mvc) force was 19% lower for elbow flexors and 37% lower for knee extensors in elderly adults than in young adults. overall, the cv of force was 27% greater in the vision condition compared with the no-vision condition. the cv of force for vision was greater for elderly adults than for young adults at the 2.5% mvc target force and lower at 30 and 65% mvc. for the 2.5% mvc target force, the decline in cv of force from vision to no vision was greater for elderly adults than for young adults. at 30 and 65% mvc, the decline was significant but similar for young and elderly adults. for elbow flexors, the change in power from vision to no vision was greater for 0- to 4-hz (reduced power) and 8- to 12-hz (increased power) frequencies for elderly adults compared with young adults.   conclusion visuomotor correction contributed to force fluctuations in large proximal muscles. the contribution was greater for healthy elderly adults at low forces. visuomotor processes thus contributed to the age-related increase in force fluctuations.
abstract the strengths of interpersonal dyads formed by the attacker and defender in one-on-one situations are crucial for performance in team ball sports such as soccer. the purpose of this study was to analyze the kinematics of one-on-one defensive movements in soccer competitions, and determine the relationships between lower limb kinematics and the center of mass translation during cutting actions. six defensive scenes in which a player was responding to an offender’s dribble attack were selected for analysis. to reconstruct the three-dimensional kinematics of the players, we used a photogrammetric model-based image-matching technique. the hip and knee kinematics were calculated from the matched skeleton model. in addition, the center of mass height was expressed as a ratio of each participant’s body height. the relationships between the center of mass height and the kinematics were determined by the pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient. the normalized center of mass height at initial contact was correlated with the vertical center of mass displacement (r = 0.832, p = 0.040) and hip flexion angle at initial contact (r = −0.823, p = 0.044). this suggests that the lower center of mass at initial contact is an important factor to reduce the downwards vertical center of mass translation during defensive cutting actions, and that this is executed primarily through hip flexion. it is therefore recommended that players land with an adequately flexed hip at initial contact during one-on-one cutting actions to minimize the vertical center of mass excursion.  in many situations, e.g. sports injuries, three-dimensional kinematics cannot be obtained with traditional lab methods. however, if methods for reconstructing motion patterns from video sequences were available, our understanding of injury mechanisms could be improved. the aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new model-based image-matching technique for human motion reconstruction from one or more uncalibrated video sequences, using traditional motion analysis as a gold standard. a laboratory trial was conducted with one test subject performing jogging and side step cutting, while being filmed with three ordinary video cameras. this provided three single camera matchings, three double camera matchings and one triple camera matching for each of the motions. the test subject wore 33 reflective skin markers and was filmed with a seven-camera, 240 hz motion analysis system. root mean square (rms) hip and knee flexion/extension angle differences were less than 12 degrees for all the matchings. estimates for ad-/abduction (<15 degrees) and internal/external rotation (<16 degrees) were less precise. rms velocity differences up to 0.62 m/s were found for the single camera matchings, but for the triple camera matching the rms differences were less than 0.13 m/s for each direction. in conclusion, a new model-based image-matching technique has been developed, that can be used to estimate temporal joint angle histories, velocities and accelerations from uncalibrated video recordings. the kinematic estimates, in particular for center of mass velocity and acceleration, are clearly better when two or more camera views are available. this method can potentially be used to arrive at more precise descriptions of the mechanisms of sports injuries than what has been possible without elaborate methods for three-dimensional reconstruction from uncalibrated video sequences, e.g. for knee injuries.
significant petrogenetic processes governing the geochemical evolution of magma bodies include magma recharge (including formation of ‘quenched inclusions’ or enclaves), heating and concomitant partial melting of country rock with possible ‘contamination’ of the evolving magma body (assimilation), and formation and separation of cumulates by f ractional crystallization (rafc). although the importance of modeling such open-system magma chambers subject to energy conservation has been demonstrated, the effects of concurrent removal of magma by eruption and/or variable assimilation (involving imperfect extraction of anatectic melt from wall rock) have not been considered. in this study, we extend the ec-rafc model to include the effects of eruption and variable amounts of assimilation, ax. this model, called ec-e 0racfc, tracks the compositions (trace elements and isotopes), temperatures, and masses of magma body liquid (melt), eruptive magma, cumulates and enclaves within a composite magmatic system undergoing simultaneous eruption, recharge, assimilation and fractional crystallization. the model is formulated as a set of 4 þ t þ i þ s coupled nonlinear differential equations, where the number of trace elements, radiogenic and stable isotope ratios modeled are t, i and s, respectively. solution of the ece 0racfc equations provides values for the average temperature of wall rock (ta), mass of melt within the magma body (mm), masses of cumulates (mct), enclaves (men) and wall rock (m o a) and the masses of anatectic melt generated (m a ) and assimilated (cm a ). in addition, t trace element concentrations and i þ s isotopic ratios in melt and eruptive magma (cm, em, dm), cumulates (cct, em, dm), enclaves (cen, er , d o r ) and anatectic melt (ca, ea, d o a) as a function of magma temperature (tm) are also computed. input parameters include the (user-defined) equilibration temperature (teq), a factor describing the efficiency of addition of anatectic melt (c) from country rock to host magma, the initial temperature and composition of pristine host melt (tom, c o m, em, d o m), recharge melt (t o r , c o r , er , dor ) and wall rock (t o a, c o a, ea, d o a), distribution coefficients (dm, dr, da) and their temperature dependences (dhm, dhr, dha), latent heats of transition (melting or crystallization) for wall rock (dha), pristine magma (dhm) and recharge magma (dhr) as well as the isobaric specific heat capacity of assimilant (cp,a), pristine (cp,m) and recharge (cp,r) melts. the magma recharge mass and eruptive magma mass functions,mr(tm) andme(tm), respectively, are specified a priori. mr(tm) and me(tm) are modeled as either continuous or episodic (step-like) processes. melt productivity functions, which prescribe the relationship between melt mass fraction and temperature, are defined for end-member bulk compositions characterizing the local geologic site. ec-e 0racfc has potential for addressing fundamental questions in igneous petrology such as: what are intrusive to extrusive ratios (i/e) for particular magmatic systems, and how does this factor relate to rates of crustal growth? how does i/e vary temporally at single, long-lived magmatic centers? what system characteristics are most profoundly influenced by eruption? what is the quantitative relationship between recharge and assimilation? in cases where the extraction efficiency can be shown to be less than unity, what geologic criteria are important and  a conservation-of-energy equation has been derived for the spatially averaged magma temperature in a spherical pluton undergoing simultaneous crystallization and both internal (magma) and external (hydrothermal fluid) thermal convection. the model accounts for the dependence of magma viscosity on crystallinity, temperature, and bulk composition; it includes latent heat effects and the effects of different initial water concentrations in the melt and quantitatively considers the role that large volumes of circulatory hydrothermal fluids play in dissipating heat. the nonlinear ordinary differential equation describing these processes has been solved for a variety of magma compositions, initial termperatures, initial crystallinities, volume ratios of hydrothermal fluid to magma, and pluton sizes. these calculations are graphically summarized in plots of the average magma temperature versus time after emplacement. solidification times, defined as the time necessary for magma to cool from the initial emplacement temperature to the solidus temperature vary as r1,3, where r is the pluton radius. the solidification time of a pluton with a radius of 1 kilometer is 5 x 104 years; for an otherwise identical pluton with a radius of 10 kilometers, the solidification time is ∼106 years. the water content has a marked effect on the solidification time. a granodiorite pluton with a radius of 5 kilometers and either 0.5 or 4 percent (by weight) water cools in 3.3 x 105 or 5 x 104 years, respectively. convection solidification times are usually but not always less than conduction cooling times.
this study was designed to investigate the effect of acute and chronic intrathecal (i.t.) injection of gabapentin (gbp) on the antinociceptive effect of morphine and tolerance development using a tail-flick latency test. levels of excitatory amino acids (eaa) in i.t. csf dialysates were also measured by high performance liquid chromatography. male wistar rats were implanted with either one or two i.t. catheters for drug injection or pump infusion and with a microdialysis probe for csf dialysate collection. the effect of acute gbp (10 microg i.t.) injection on the morphine dose response was examined in both naïve rats and rats made tolerant by continuous infusion of morphine (15 microg/h i.t.) for 5 days. at such a low dose (10 microg i.t.), gbp did not enhance morphine's antinociception in naïve rats. in morphine-tolerant rats, however, acute gbp (10 microg i.t.) injection potentiated morphine's antinociception and yielded a 14.6-fold shift in morphine's dose-response curve. when gbp (10 microg/h i.t.) was co-infused with morphine (15 microg/h i.t.) to examine its effect on the development of morphine tolerance, gbp attenuated the development of morphine tolerance. the effect of gbp and morphine on csf glutamate and aspartate levels was examined in naïve rats, and the effect of morphine challenge on csf glutamate and aspartate levels was examined in rats previously infused for 5 days with morphine alone or morphine plus gbp. acute injection of gbp (10 microg i.t.), morphine (50 microg i.t.), or gbp (10 microg i.t.) followed by morphine (50 microg i.t.) 30 min later had no significant effect on csf eaa concentration in naïve rats; however, in tolerant rats, morphine challenge (50 microg i.t.) increased aspartate and glutamate levels to 221 +/- 22% and 296 +/- 43%, respectively, of those before morphine challenge, and this phenomenon was inhibited by gbp co-infusion. our results show that gbp, at a dose without enhanced effect on morphine's antinociception in naïve rats, not only potentiates morphine's antinociceptive effect in morphine-tolerant rats but also attenuates the development of morphine tolerance. the mechanism of the effect of gbp on morphine tolerance might be via suppression of the eaa concentration in spinal csf dialysate.  recent studies indicate that glutamate binding to n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in the spinal cord is involved in triggering the development of chronic pain however, the processes which directly underlie the increased pain remain unclear. here we report that, following peripheral nerve injury (ligation of the sciatic nerve) in the rat, there is an increase in immunoreactive labelling of non-n-methyl-d-asparatate, ampa (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionate), glutamate receptors in the superficial laminae of the lumbar spinal cord ipsilateral to the ligation. the increase in ampa receptor expression peaks 14 days after nerve ligation and decreases 35 days post-ligation, corresponding to the time-course of heightened sensitivity to mechanical and thermal noxious stimuli (hyperalgesia) induced by the ligation. given evidence that ampa receptors in the superficial laminae mediate fast nociceptive transmission in the spinal cord, our findings suggest that an upregulation of spinal ampa receptors contributes to hyperalgesia following peripheral nerve injury.
fusarium verticillioides produces the mycotoxin fumonisin b(1) (fb(1)) on maize kernels. in this study, we identified a putative protein phosphatase gene cpp1 in f. verticillioides, and investigated its role in fb(1) regulation. previous work has shown that cpp1 expression is elevated in an fb(1)-suppressing genetic background. thus, we hypothesized that cpp1 is negatively associated with fb(1) production. to test this hypothesis, we generated a cpp1 knockout mutant, pp179, and studied the effects of gene deletion on fb(1) biosynthesis and fungal development. pp179 showed elevated expression of fum genes, and in turn produced higher levels of fb(1) than the wild-type progenitor. other significant mutant phenotypes included reduced radial growth on agar plates, reduced conidia germination rates, significantly increased macroconidia formation, and hyphal swelling. to verify that these phenotypes were directly due to cpp1 deletion, we complemented pp179 with the wild-type cpp1 gene. the complemented strain ppc4 showed fum1 expression and fb(1) production similar to that of the wild-type, providing evidence that cpp1 is negatively associated with fb(1) biosynthesis. other pp179 phenotypes, such as macroconidiation and hyphal swelling, were also restored to that of wild-type progenitor. furthermore, we complemented f. verticillioides pp179 strain with neurospora crassa wild-type ppe-1 gene, demonstrating that cpp1 and ppe-1 proteins are functionally conserved. pleiotropic effects of cpp1 deletion led us to hypothesize that cpp1 is associated with multiple downstream signalling pathways in f. verticillioides. identification and functional characterization of downstream cpp1-interacting proteins are necessary to better understand the complex regulatory mechanisms associated with cpp1.  yeast cells can select bud sites in either of two distinct spatial patterns. a cells and alpha cells typically bud in an axial pattern, in which both mother and daughter cells form new buds adjacent to the preceding division site. in contrast, a/alpha cells typically bud in a bipolar pattern, in which new buds can form at either pole of the cell. the bud3 gene is specifically required for the axial pattern of budding: mutations of bud3 (including a deletion) affect the axial pattern but not the bipolar pattern. the sequence of bud3 predicts a product (bud3p) of 1635 amino acids with no strong or instructive similarities to previously known proteins. however, immunofluorescence localization of bud3p has revealed that it assembles in an apparent double ring encircling the mother-bud neck shortly after the mitotic spindle forms. the bud3p structure at the neck persists until cytokinesis, when it splits to yield a single ring of bud3p marking the division site on each of the two progeny cells. these single rings remain for much of the ensuing unbudded phase and then disassemble. the bud3p rings are indistinguishable from those of the neck filament- associated proteins (cdc3p, cdc10p, cdc11p, and cdc12p), except that the latter proteins assemble before bud emergence and remain in place for the duration of the cell cycle. upon shift of a temperature- sensitive cdc12 mutant to restrictive temperature, localization of both bud3p and the neck filament-associated proteins is rapidly lost. in addition, a haploid cdc11 mutant loses its axial-budding pattern upon shift to restrictive temperature. taken together, the data suggest that bud3p and the neck filaments are linked in a cycle in which each controls the position of the other's assembly: bud3p assembles onto the neck filaments in one cell cycle to mark the site for axial budding (including assembly of the new ring of neck filaments) in the next cell cycle. as the expression and localization of bud3p are similar in a, alpha, and a/alpha cells, additional regulation must exist such that bud3p restricts the position of bud formation in a and alpha cells but not in a/alpha cells.
in response to a variety of environmental cues, prokaryotes can switch between a motile and a sessile, biofilm‐forming mode of growth. the regulatory mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying this switch are largely unknown in archaea but involve small winged helix‐turn‐helix dna‐binding proteins of the archaea‐specific lrs14 family. here, we study the lrs14 member abfr1 of sulfolobus acidocaldarius. small‐angle x‐ray scattering data are presented, which are consistent with a model of dimeric abfr1 in which dimerization occurs via an antiparallel coiled coil as suggested by homology modeling. furthermore, solution structure data of abfr1‐dna complexes suggest that upon binding dna, abfr1 induces deformations in the dna. the wing residues tyrosine 84 and serine 87, which are phosphorylated in vivo, are crucial to establish stable protein‐dna contacts and their substitution with a negatively charged glutamate or aspartate residue inhibits formation of a nucleoprotein complex. furthermore, mutation abrogates the cellular abundance and transcription regulatory function of abfr1 and thus affects the resulting biofilm and motility phenotype of s. acidocaldarius. this work establishes a novel whth dna‐binding mode for lrs14‐like proteins and hints at an important role for protein phosphorylation as a signal transduction mechanism for the control of biofilm formation and motility in archaea.  in this study, the in vitro and in vivo functions of the only two identified protein phosphatases, saci-ptp and saci-pp2a, in the crenarchaeal model organism sulfolobus acidocaldarius were investigated. biochemical characterization revealed that saci-ptp is a dual-specific phosphatase (against pser/pthr and ptyr), whereas saci-pp2a exhibited specific pser/pthr activity and inhibition by okadaic acid. deletion of saci_pp2a resulted in pronounced alterations in growth, cell shape and cell size, which could be partially complemented. transcriptome analysis of the three strains (δsaci_ptp, δsaci_pp2a and the mw001 parental strain) revealed 155 genes that were differentially expressed in the deletion mutants, and showed significant changes in expression of genes encoding the archaella (archaeal motility structure), components of the respiratory chain and transcriptional regulators. phosphoproteome studies revealed 801 unique phosphoproteins in total, with an increase in identified phosphopeptides in the deletion mutants. proteins from most functional categories were affected by phosphorylation, including components of the motility system, the respiratory chain, and regulatory proteins. in the saci_pp2a deletion mutant the up-regulation at the transcript level, as well as the observed phosphorylation pattern, resembled starvation stress responses. hypermotility was also observed in the saci_pp2a deletion mutant. the results highlight the importance of protein phosphorylation in regulating essential cellular processes in the crenarchaeon s. acidocaldarius.
heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) regulates diverse signaling pathways. emerging evidence suggests that hsp90 inhibitors, such as 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-aag), enhance dna damage-induced cell death, suggesting that hsp90 may regulate cellular responses to genotoxic stress. however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. here, we show that the fanconi anemia (fa) pathway is involved in the hsp90-mediated regulation of genotoxic stress response. in the fa pathway, assembly of 8 fa proteins including fanca into a nuclear multiprotein complex, and the complex-dependent activation of fancd2 are critical events for cellular tolerance against dna cross-linkers. hsp90 associates with fanca, in vivo and in vitro, in a 17-aag-sensitive manner. disruption of the fanca/hsp90 association by cellular treatment with 17-aag induces rapid proteasomal degradation and cytoplasmic relocalization of fanca, leading to impaired activation of fancd2. furthermore, 17-aag promotes dna cross-linker-induced cytotoxicity, but this effect is much less pronounced in fa pathway-defective cells. notably, 17-aag enhances dna cross-linker-induced chromosome aberrations. in conclusion, our results identify fanca as a novel client of hsp90, suggesting that hsp90 promotes activation of the fa pathway through regulation of intracellular turnover and trafficking of fanca, which is critical for cellular tolerance against genotoxic stress.  standing watch over the proteome, molecular chaperones are an ancient and evolutionarily conserved class of proteins that guide the normal folding, intracellular disposition and proteolytic turnover of many of the key regulators of cell growth, differentiation and survival. this essential guardian function is subverted during oncogenesis to allow malignant transformation and to facilitate rapid somatic evolution. pharmacologically 'bribing' the essential guard duty of the chaperone hsp90 (heat-shock protein of 90 kda) seems to offer a unique anticancer strategy of considerable promise.
dependence of plasma total homocysteine (thcy) and dna damage profiles on melanodialdehyde (mda), oxidative stress, liver function tests (lft), and lipids was studied in non-obese and obese subjects in the pakistani population. development of obesity is influenced by both genetic, biochemical and environmental factors. plasma homocysteine (hcy) and dna damage profiles play a pivotal role in its progression. we studied 160 obesity patients and 160 lean subjects. leukocytes were evaluated for dna damage by comet assay and blood plasma for biochemical properties using commercial kits. plasma hcy level and dna damage were strongly correlated with triglycerides (p < 0.000), ldl-cholesterol (p < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), cholesterol (p < 0.004), mda (p < 0.004) and total oxygen stress (p < 0.004) in obese individuals. both hyc and dna damage were negatively associated with total anti-oxidant response and globulin. both hcy profile and dna damage may have a role in the endothelium damage even in the normal range and are related to triglycerides, alt, mda, tos, hdl- and ldl-cholesterol in the pakistani population.  background moderate elevations in plasma homocyst(e)ine concentrations are associated with atherosclerosis and hypertension. we tested the hypothesis that experimental perturbation of homocysteine levels produces resistance and conduit vessel endothelial dysfunction and that this occurs through increased oxidant stress.   methods and results oral administration of l-methionine (100 mg/kg) was used to induce moderate hyperhomocyst(e)inemia ( approximately 25 micromol/l) in healthy human subjects. endothelial function of forearm resistance vessels was assessed by use of forearm vasodilatation to brachial artery administration of the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine. conduit vessel endothelial function was assessed with flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery. forearm resistance vessel dilatation to acetylcholine was significantly impaired 7 hours after methionine (methionine, 477+/-82%; placebo, 673+/-110%; p=0.016). methionine did not alter vasodilatation to nitroprusside and verapamil. flow-mediated dilatation was significantly impaired 8 hours after methionine loading (0.3+/-2.7%) compared with placebo (8. 2+/-1.6%, p=0.01). oral administration of the antioxidant ascorbic acid (2 g) prevented methionine-induced endothelial dysfunction in both conduit and resistance vessels (p=0.03).   conclusions experimentally increasing plasma homocyst(e)ine concentrations by methionine loading rapidly impairs both conduit and resistance vessel endothelial function in healthy humans. endothelial dysfunction in conduit and resistance vessels may underlie the reported associations between homocysteine and atherosclerosis and hypertension. increased oxidant stress appears to play a pathophysiological role in the deleterious endothelial effects of homocysteine.
purpose – the purpose of this paper is to understand how meaning is assigned to online searching by viewing it as a mundane, yet often invisible, activity of everyday life and an integrated part of ...  web search engines have become indispensable tools for finding information online effectively. as the range of information, context and users of internet searches has grown, the relationship between the search query, search interest and user has become more tenuous. not all users are seeking the same information, even if they use the same query term. thus, the quality of search results has, at least potentially, been decreasing. search engines have begun to respond to this problem by trying to personalise search in order to deliver more relevant results to the users. a query is now evaluated in the context of a user’s search history and other data compiled into a personal profile and associated with statistical groups. this, at least, is the promise stated by the search engines themselves. this paper tries to assess the current reality of the personalisation of search results. we analyse the mechanisms of personalisation in the case of google web search by empirically testing three commonly held assumptions about what personalisation does. to do this, we developed new digital methods which are explained here. the findings suggest that google personal search does not fully provide the much-touted benefits for its search users. more likely, it seems to serve the interest of advertisers in providing more relevant audiences to them.
alternative splicing at the mapt gene exon 10 yields similar levels of the 3r and 4r tau protein isoforms.1 the presence of mutations, particularly in exon 10 and intron 10–11, changes the quantity of tau isoforms. domination each of the isoform yields tau protein aggregation and frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (ftdp-17). here, we report for the first time the secondary structure of the 194/195 nucleotide region for the wild type (wt) and 10 mutants of the mapt gene pre-mrna determined using both chemical and microarray mapping. thermodynamic analyses indicate that single nucleotide mutations in the splicing regulatory element (sre) that form a hairpin affect its stability by up to 4 and 7 kcal/mol. moreover, binding the regulatory hairpin of small molecule ligands (neomycin, kanamycin, tobramycin and mitoxantrone) enhance its stability depending on the nature of the ligands and the rna mutations. experiments using the cos-7 cell line indicate that the presence of ligands and modified antisense oligonucleotides affect the quantity of 3r and 4r isoforms. this finding correlates with the thermodynamic stability of the regulatory hairpin. an alternative splicing regulation mechanism for exon 10 is postulated based on our experimental data and on published data.  we have determined the sequences of isoforms of human tau protein, which differ from previously reported forms by insertions of 29 or 58 amino acids in the amino-terminal region. complementary dna cloning shows that the insertions occur in combination with both three and four tandem repeats. rnaase protection assays indicate that transcripts encoding isoforms with the insertions are expressed in an adult-specific manner. transcripts encoding four tandem repeats are also expressed in an adult-specific manner, whereas mrnas encoding three tandem repeats are expressed throughout life, including in fetal brain. the levels of transcripts encoding the 29 or 58 amino acid inserts were not significantly changed in cerebral cortex from patients with alzheimer's disease. antisera raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to these different human tau isoforms demonstrate that multiple tau protein isoforms are incorporated into the neurofibrillary tangles of alzheimer's disease.
the degree of evolutionary conservation of an amino acid in a protein or a nucleic acid in dna/rna reflects a balance between its natural tendency to mutate and the overall need to retain the structural integrity and function of the macromolecule. the consurf web server (http://consurf.tau.ac.il), established over 15 years ago, analyses the evolutionary pattern of the amino/nucleic acids of the macromolecule to reveal regions that are important for structure and/or function. starting from a query sequence or structure, the server automatically collects homologues, infers their multiple sequence alignment and reconstructs a phylogenetic tree that reflects their evolutionary relations. these data are then used, within a probabilistic framework, to estimate the evolutionary rates of each sequence position. here we introduce several new features into consurf, including automatic selection of the best evolutionary model used to infer the rates, the ability to homology-model query proteins, prediction of the secondary structure of query rna molecules from sequence, the ability to view the biological assembly of a query (in addition to the single chain), mapping of the conservation grades onto 2d rna models and an advanced view of the phylogenetic tree that enables interactively rerunning consurf with the taxa of a sub-tree.  motivation a number of proteins of known three-dimensional (3d) structure exist, with yet unknown function. in light of the recent progress in structure determination methodology, this number is likely to increase rapidly. a novel method is presented here: 'rate4site', which maps the rate of evolution among homologous proteins onto the molecular surface of one of the homologues whose 3d-structure is known. functionally important regions often correspond to surface patches of slowly evolving residues.   results rate4site estimates the rate of evolution of amino acid sites using the maximum likelihood (ml) principle. the ml estimate of the rates considers the topology and branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree, as well as the underlying stochastic process. to demonstrate its potency, we study the src sh2 domain. like previously established methods, rate4site detected the sh2 peptide-binding groove. interestingly, it also detected inter-domain interactions between the sh2 domain and the rest of the src protein that other methods failed to detect.
we present fast and cost-efficient parallel algorithms for a number of important and fundamental matrix computation problems on linear arrays with reconfigurable pipelined optical bus systems. these problems include computing the inverse, the characteristic polynomial, the determinant, the rank, the nth power, and an lu- and a qr-factorization of a matrix and solving linear systems of equations. our algorithms provide a wide range of performance?cost combinations. compared with known results, the running time of parallel solutions to all these problems can be reduced by a factor of o(logn) while costs are maintained under o(n4).  we present several optical interconnection structures which support communication requirements unique to multiprocessor systems, namely, broadcasting, multicasting, simulcasting, and multiport memory access. the structures are based on guided wave time division multiplexed channels and use coincident pulse techniques to optically demultiplex individual bits at selected destinations. we describe 1-and 2-d structures which are appropriate for processor to processor interconnections and for processor to memory interconnections, respectively.
ankyrin-repeat protein with a pest motif and a proline-rich region (arpp), also designated as ankrd2, is a member of the muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (marps), which have been proposed to be involved in muscle stress response pathways. arpp/ankrd2 is localized mainly in the i-band of striated muscle. however, it has recently been reported that arpp/ankrd2 can interact with nuclear proteins, such as premyelocytic leukemia protein (pml), p53 and yb-1 in vitro. in this study, to determine whether nuclear accumulation of arpp/ankrd2 actually occurs, we performed an immunohistochemical investigation of gastrocnemius muscles that had been injured by injection of cardiotoxin or contact with dry ice. we found that arpp/ankrd2 accumulated in the nuclei of myofibers located adjacent to severely damaged myofibers after muscle injury. double-labeled immunohistochemistry revealed that arpp/ankrd2 accumulated in the nuclei of sarcomere-damaged myofibers. furthermore, we found that arpp/ankrd2 tended to be localized in euchromatin where genes are transcriptionally activated. based on these findings, we suggest that arpp/ankrd2 may translocate from the i-band to the nucleus in response to muscle damage and may participate in the regulation of gene expression.  in this study, we isolated and characterized a murine counterpart of the human arpp (harpp) gene. sequence analysis revealed that the murine arpp (marpp) gene is almost identical to the ankrd2 gene, which has recently been isolated as a mouse gene induced in stretched skeletal muscle. the marpp gene encodes a protein of 332 amino acids that contains four well-conserved ankyrin-repeat domains in the central portion of the protein. the amino acid sequence of marpp protein (marpp) is highly homologous to that of mouse cardiac-restricted ankyrin-repeat protein (carp), which is proposed to be a putative genetic marker for cardiac hypertrophy. immunohistochemical analysis revealed that marpp is preferentially expressed in type 1 skeletal muscle fibers, and that marpp is localized in both the nucleus and the sarcomeric i-band of muscle fibers, suggesting that arpp may function as a nuclear and sarcomeric protein. furthermore, marpp was also expressed in neurons of the cerebellum and cerebrum, the islets of langerhans in the pancreas, and the esophageal epithelium, suggesting that marpp may play a functional physiologic role in brain, pancreas, and esophagus as well as in type 1 muscle fibers. interestingly, although marpp was localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm in neurons, its localization was restricted to nucleus in pancreas and esophagus, suggesting that intracellular localization of marpp is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. furthermore, we found that marpp- and carp-expression in skeletal muscle were markedly up-regulated after denervation. although the elevated expression level of carp was kept only for two weeks after denervation, that of arpp was kept at least for 4 weeks, suggesting that marpp and carp may play distinct functional roles in denervated skeletal muscle.
although risk and benefits of risky activities are positively correlated in the real world, empirical results indicate that people perceive them as negatively correlated. the common explanation is that confounding benefits and losses stems from affect. in this article, we address the issue that has not been clearly established in studies on the affect heuristic: to what extent boundary conditions, such as judgments' generality and expertise, influence the presence of the inverse relation in judgments of hazards. these conditions were examined in four studies in which respondents evaluated general or specific benefits and risks of "affect-rich" and "affect-poor" hazards (ranging from investments to applications of stem cell research). in line with previous research, affect is defined as good or bad feelings integral to a stimulus. in contrast to previous research, affect is considered as related both to personal feelings and to social controversies associated with a hazard. expertise is related to personal knowledge (laypersons vs. experts) as well as to objective knowledge (targets well vs. poorly known to science). the direct comparison of the input from personal and objective ignorance into the inverse relation has not been investigated previously. it was found that affect invoked by a hazard guides general but not specific judgments of its benefits and risks. technical expertise helps to avoid simplified evaluations of consequences as long as they are well known to science. for new, poorly understood hazards (e.g., stem cell research), expertise does not protect from the perception of the inverse relation between benefits and risks.  hypotheses involving mediation are common in the behavioral sciences. mediation exists when a predictor affects a dependent variable indirectly through at least one intervening variable, or mediator. methods to assess mediation involving multiple simultaneous mediators have received little attention in the methodological literature despite a clear need. we provide an overview of simple and multiple mediation and explore three approaches that can be used to investigate indirect processes, as well as methods for contrasting two or more mediators within a single model. we present an illustrative example, assessing and contrasting potential mediators of the relationship between the helpfulness of socialization agents and job satisfaction. we also provide sas and spss macros, as well as mplus and lisrel syntax, to facilitate the use of these methods in applications.
hypothalamic serotonin inhibits food intake and stimulates energy expenditure. high-fat feeding is obesogenic, but the role of polyunsaturated fats is not well understood. this study examined the influence of different high-pufa diets on serotonin-induced hypophagia, hypothalamic serotonin turnover, and hypothalamic protein levels of serotonin transporter (st), and sr-1b and sr-2c receptors. male wistar rats received for 9 weeks from weaning a diet high in either soy oil or fish oil or low fat (control diet). throughout 9 weeks, daily intake of fat diets decreased such that energy intake was similar to that of the control diet. however, the fish group developed heavier retroperitoneal and epididymal fat depots. after 12 h of either 200 or 300 μg intracerebroventricular serotonin, food intake was significantly inhibited in control group (21–25%) and soy group (37–39%) but not in the fish group. serotonin turnover was significantly lower in the fish group than in both the control group (−13%) and the soy group (−18%). sr-2c levels of fish group were lower than those of control group (50%, p = 0.02) and soy group (37%, p = 0.09). st levels tended to decrease in the fish group in comparison to the control group (16%, p = 0.339) and the soy group (21%, p = 0.161). thus, unlike the soy-oil diet, the fish-oil diet decreased hypothalamic serotonin turnover and sr-2c levels and abolished serotonin-induced hypophagia. fish-diet rats were potentially hypophagic, suggesting that, at least up to this point in its course, the serotonergic impairment was either compensated by other factors or not of a sufficient extent to affect feeding. that fat pad weight increased in the absence of hyperphagia indicates that energy expenditure was affected by the serotonergic hypofunction.  objective using rats we examined whether maternal intake of hydrogenated fat rich in trans fatty acids affects brain fatty acid profile, hypothalamic content of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 proteins, and the hypophagic effect of centrally administered insulin in 3-mo-old male progeny.   methods throughout pregnancy and lactation, wistar rats ate isocaloric/normolipidic diets with soybean oil (control) or soybean oil-derived hydrogenated fat (trans diet) as a fat source. upon weaning, the trans offspring continued on the trans diet (trans group) or were switched to a control diet (trans-control group).   results compared with control rats, trans rats had lower brain levels of eicosapentaenoic acid. compared with trans rats, trans-control rats had increased levels of total polyunsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid and decreased levels of trans fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and monounsaturated fatty acids. insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 levels were significantly lower (44% and 38%, respectively) in trans than in control rats. in trans-control rats, insulin receptor was 26% lower (p < 0.05), whereas insulin receptor substrate-1 was 50% lower, than in control rats. insulin decreased 24-h feeding in control (27%) and trans (38%) rats but failed to do so in trans-control rats. the latter group had increased serum glucose levels.   conclusions the data suggest that the early (intrauterine/perinatal) exposure to hydrogenated fat rich in trans fatty acids programmed the hypothalamic feeding control mechanisms. as young adults, only trans-control animals showed loss of insulin-induced hypophagia, indicating that the mismatch between early and later nutritional environments was relevant. however, the trans group also showed signs of altered appetite signaling mechanisms, suggesting that the early adaptations may have deleterious consequences later in life.
background emotion regulation theory aims to explain the interactions between individuals and the environment. in this context, emotion regulation difficulties (erd) disrupt the physiological component of emotions through the autonomic nervous system and are involved in several psychopathological states. objective we were interested in comparing the influence of a film-elicited emotion procedure on the autonomic nervous system activity of two groups with different levels of emotion regulation difficulties. methods a total of 63 women (undergraduate students) ranging from 18 to 27 (20.7±1.99) years old were included. using the upper and lower quartile of a questionnaire assessing the daily difficulties in regulating emotions, two groups, one with low (lerd) and one with high (herd) levels of emotion regulation difficulties, were constituted and studied during a film-elicited emotion procedure. cardiac vagal activity (hf-hrv) was analyzed during three periods: baseline, film-elicited emotion, and recovery. results the cardiovascular results showed a decrease in hf-hrv from baseline to elicitation for both groups. then, from elicitation to recovery, hf-hrv increased for the lerd group, whereas a low hf-hrv level persisted for the herd group. conclusions the herd group exhibited inappropriate cardiac vagal recovery after a negative emotion elicitation had ended. cardiac vagal tone took longer to return to its initial state in the herd group than in the lerd group. prolonged cardiac vagal suppression might constitute an early marker of emotion regulation difficulties leading to lower cardiac vagal tone.  we examined the relationship between tonic--a correlate of self-regulatory functioning--and phasic cardiac vagal activity (indexed by heart rate variability; hrv) during a selective attentional task with varying levels of load. participants detected a target letter among letter strings superimposed on either fearful or neutral face distractors. letter strings consisted of six target letters under low load and one target letter and five nontarget letters under high load. with fearful distractors, lower tonic hrv was associated with phasic hrv suppression, suggesting an autonomic stress response under both low and high load. in contrast, higher tonic hrv was associated with phasic hrv enhancement, suggesting greater self-regulatory effort under low load and an absence of phasic hrv suppression under high load. the current research suggests that tonic cardiac vagal tone is associated with the ability to flexibly adapt autonomic responses.
the first part of this research was devoted to investigating the effect of alternate current (ac) using four different types of wave modes (pulse-wave) at 2 hz on the crystal growth of lysozyme in solution. the best results, in terms of size and crystal quality, were obtained when protein crystals were grown under the influence of electric fields in a very specific wave mode (“breathing” wave), giving the highest resolution up to 1.34 a in x-ray diffraction analysis compared with controls and with those crystals grown in gel. in the second part, we evaluated the effect of a strong magnetic field of 16.5 tesla combined with radiofrequency pulses of 0.43 μs on the crystal growth in gels of tetragonal hen egg white (hew) lysozyme. the lysozyme crystals grown, both in solution applying breathing-wave and in gel under the influence of this strong magnetic field with pulses of radio frequencies, produced the larger-in-size crystals and the highest resolution structures. data processing and refinement statistics are very good in terms of the resolution, mosaicity and wilson b factor obtained for each crystal. besides, electron density maps show well-defined and distinctly separated atoms at several selected tryptophan residues for the crystal grown using the “breathing wave pulses”.  protein crystallization under a magnetic field is an interesting research topic because a magnetic field may provide a special environment to acquire improved quality protein crystals. because high-quality protein crystals are very useful in high-resolution structure determination using diffraction techniques (x-ray, neutron, and electron diffraction), research using magnetic fields in protein crystallization has attracted substantial interest; some studies have been performed in the past two decades. in this research field, the hardware is especially essential for successful studies because the environment is special and the design and utilization of the research apparatus in such an environment requires special considerations related to the magnetic field. this paper reviews the hardware for protein crystallization (including the magnet systems and the apparatus designed for use in a magnetic field) and progress in this area. future prospects in this field will also be discussed.
the influence of central injection of a new corticotropin releasing factor (crf) antagonist, astressin, [cyclo(30-33)[d-phe12,nle21,38,glu30,lys33]r/ hcrf12-41)], on exogenous and endogenous crf-induced gastric ileus and stimulation of bowel discharges was investigated in conscious rats. intracisternal (ic) crf (0.6 microg) reduced gastric emptying of a noncaloric solution to 17.1 +/- 4.9% compared with 50.1 +/- 4.6% in control group injected i.c. with vehicle. astressin (1,3 and 10 microg, i.c.) dose dependently prevented ic crf-induced delayed gastric emptying by 33, 100 and 100%, respectively, and had no effect on basal gastric emptying. abdominal surgery with cecal manipulation (1 min) reduced gastric emptying to 19.8 +/- 5.5% 3 hr postsurgery compared with 59.9 +/- 5.2% after anesthesia alone plus i.c. vehicle. astressin (1,3 and 10 microg, i.c.) prevented postoperative gastric ileus by 56, 93 and 92%, respectively. intracerebroventricular crf (0.6 microg) and water-avoidance stress stimulated pellet output (number/60 min) to 5 +/- 1 and 11 +/- 2, respectively, compared with no fecal pellet output after i.c.v. vehicle and no exposure to stress. astressin (3 and 10 microg, i.c.v.) blocked exogenous crf action by 47 and 63%, respectively, and colonic response to stress by 0 and 54%, respectively. these data indicate that astressin injected into the csf at low doses (1-10 microg) has an antagonistic action against crf and stress-related alterations of gastrointestinal motor function, without an intrinsic effect in these in vivo systems. astressin may be a useful tool to explore functional crf-dependent physiological pathways in specific brain nuclei.  background/aims interleukin 1 beta (il-1 beta) increases the release of corticotropin-releasing factor (crf) in the brain through prostaglandin pathways. because central crf inhibits gastric motor function, the influence and mechanism of action of intracisternal injection of il-1 beta on gastric emptying were investigated.   methods the 20-minute rate of gastric emptying of a nonnutrient test meal was assessed by the phenol red methylcellulose method 30 minutes after injection of human recombinant il-1 beta in conscious rats.   results il-1 beta injected intracisternally (0.01-1 ng) or intravenously (0.01-10 ng) dose-dependently decreased gastric emptying by 10%-82% and 0%-89%, respectively. the median effective dose (ed50) was 30-fold lower when il-1 beta was injected intracisternally (0.1 ng) than intravenously (3 ng). the inhibitory effect of intracisternal il-1 beta had a rapid onset (within 20 minutes) and was long-lasting (6 hours). indomethacin (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) completely prevented the 61% inhibition induced by intracisternal il-1 beta (0.1 ng) but had no effect on crf-induced (600 ng) 72% inhibition of gastric emptying. the intracisternal injection of the il-1 receptor antagonist (100 ng) or the crf antagonist [dphe12, [dphe12,nle21,38,c alpha meleu37]crf12-41 (20 micrograms) prevented by 100% and 52%, respectively, the inhibition of gastric emptying evoked by intracisternal il-1 beta (0.1 ng). the antagonists alone had no effect on basal gastric emptying.   conclusions il-1 beta acts in the brain to induce a long-lasting inhibition of gastric emptying; il-1 beta action is mediated through central il-1 receptors and prostaglandin- and crf-dependent mechanisms.
during assessment year 2004-2005, income tax department of government of india has shifted to new paradigm by introducing an emerging e-government service - e-filling (online tax filing). this government-to-citizens (g2c) service has significant benefits for both- government as well as for taxpayers in terms of cost effective, convenient, time saving, accuracy, fast, secure, more productive and efficient. while several benefits incurred in e-filing, all the taxpayers of country many not be able to realize these benefits due to several factors. a large number of taxpayers still prefer pen and paper based tax filing or take help of intermediaries (e.g. tax consultant) in order to file return. in developing country like india, internet and technology is still out of reach of many citizens and people are not technologically matured to utilize full potentiality of internet and technology. the purpose of this study is to investigate the underlying factors that influence citizens' intensions to adopt e-filing in the indian context. quantitative approach is used in this study to investigate adoption factors and total 349 questionnaires were received and 294 were found valid to analyze. participants in the survey were indian citizens who file their taxes to indian authorities.  the proposed e-filing integrated adoption model is built on prior theories - technology adoption model (tam), diffusion of innovation (doi), perceived characteristics of innovating (pci), web trust theory and perceived risk, web service quality. the result of the analysis showed that perceive usefulness (pu), perceived ease-of-use (peou), compatibility, service quality, trust of the internet, trust of the government, result demonstrability, service quality and social influence are found to be significant predictors of citizens' intention to use e-filing.  this study has established a comprehensive research model integrating major theories and dimensions of adoption. the study may assist government or other concern authorities to understand citizens' behavior and their perceptions towards e-fling system and other e-government services too. the study suggests that upgrading e-filing system services will improve taxpayers' compliance that will improve the intention of taxpayers positively to use it. future research might employ a larger sample to generalize to the whole country. furthermore, qualitative research like interview with selected taxpayers can cater other factors related to efficiency and effectiveness of e-filing.  abstract. electronic government, or e‐government, increases the convenience and accessibility of government services and information to citizens. despite the benefits of e‐government – increased government accountability to citizens, greater public access to information and a more efficient, cost‐effective government – the success and acceptance of e‐government initiatives, such as online voting and licence renewal, are contingent upon citizens’ willingness to adopt this innovation. in order to develop ‘citizen‐centred’ e‐government services that provide participants with accessible, relevant information and quality services that are more expedient than traditional ‘brick and mortar’ transactions, government agencies must first understand the factors that influence citizen adoption of this innovation. this study integrates constructs from the technology acceptance model, diffusions of innovation theory and web trust models to form a parsimonious yet comprehensive model of factors that influence citizen adoption of e‐government initiatives. the study was conducted by surveying a broad diversity of citizens at a community event. the findings indicate that perceived ease of use, compatibility and trustworthiness are significant predictors of citizens’ intention to use an e‐government service. implications of this study for research and practice are presented.
abstract localized or windowed data denoising based on linear transforms equipped with some thresholding operator is a usual approach in modern signal and image processing. with overlapping windows, techniques of this kind can be interpreted as overcomplete (redundant) data transforms (representations). in the simplest formulation, the final estimatesfor points belongingtomultiple overlapping windows are calculated as themean of the estimates independently obtained for each of the windows. in this paper we propose a general approach leading to a mix-distribution modeling of the overcomplete data and to least-squares optimal final estimates in the form of weighted average of the least-square estimates for the windowed data. experiments demonstrate the advanced performance of this class of the algorithms, in particular in comparison with the standard ones using the sample averaging of the windowed estimates.  de-noising with the traditional (orthogonal, maximally-decimated) wavelet transform sometimes exhibits visual artifacts; we attribute some of these—for example, gibbs phenomena in the neighborhood of discontinuities—to the lack of translation invariance of the wavelet basis. one method to suppress such artifacts, termed “cycle spinning” by coifman, is to “average out” the translation dependence. for a range of shifts, one shifts the data (right or left as the case may be), de-noises the shifted data, and then unshifts the de-noised data. doing this for each of a range of shifts, and averaging the several results so obtained, produces a reconstruction subject to far weaker gibbs phenomena than thresholding based de-noising using the traditional orthogonal wavelet transform.
abstract prior studies of careseeking fibromyalgia (fm) patients often report that they have an elevated risk of psychiatric disorders, but biased sampling may distort true risk. the current investigation utilizes state‐of‐the‐art diagnostic procedures for both fm and psychiatric disorders to estimate prevalence rates of fm and the comorbidity of fm and specific psychiatric disorders in a diverse community sample of women. participants were screened by telephone for fm and mdd, by randomly selecting telephone numbers from a list of households with women in the ny/nj metropolitan area. eligible women were invited to complete physical examinations for fm and clinician‐administered psychiatric interviews. data were weighted to adjust for sampling procedures and population demographics. the estimated overall prevalence of fm among women in the ny/nj metropolitan area was 3.7% (95% ci = 3.2, 4.4), with higher rates among racial minorities. although risk of current mdd was nearly 3‐fold higher in community women with than without fm, the groups had similar risk of lifetime mdd. risk of lifetime anxiety disorders, particularly obsessive compulsive disorder and post‐traumatic stress disorder, was approximately 5‐fold higher among women with fm. overall, this study found a community prevalence for fm among women that replicates prior north american studies, and revealed that fm may be even more prevalent among racial minority women. these community‐based data also indicate that the relationship between mdd and fm may be more complicated than previously thought, and call for an increased focus on anxiety disorders in fm.  objective traumatic events can result in a set of symptoms including nightmares, recurrent and intrusive recollections, avoidance of thoughts or activities associated with the traumatic event, and symptoms of increased arousal such as insomnia and hypervigilance. these posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd)-like symptoms are frequently observed in persons with chronic pain syndromes. little is known about how these two phenomena interact with one another. the present study evaluated ptsd-like symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (fms) and examined the relation between ptsd-like symptoms and problems associated with fms.   design ninety-three consecutive patients underwent a comprehensive fms evaluation and completed self-report questionnaires measuring ptsd-like symptoms, disability, and psychosocial responses to their pain condition. subjects were divided in two groups based on level of self-reported ptsd-like symptoms.   results approximately 56% of the sample reported clinically significant levels of ptsd-like symptoms (ptsd+). the ptsd+ patients reported significantly greater levels of pain (p < 0.01), emotional distress (p < 0.01), life interference (p < 0.01), and disability (p < 0.01) than did the patients without clinically significant levels of ptsd-like symptoms (ptsd-). over 85% of the ptsd+ patients compared with 50% of the ptsd- patients demonstrated significant disability. based on response to the multidimensional pain inventory, a significantly smaller percentage of ptsd+ patients were classified as adaptive copers (15%) compared with the ptsd- group (48.2%).   conclusions results suggest that ptsd-like symptoms are prevalent in fms patients and may influence adaptation to this chronic illness. clinicians should assess the presence of these symptoms, as the failure to attend to them in treatment may impede successful outcomes.
dengue virus (denv) co-circulates as four serotypes (denv1-4). primary infection only leads to self-limited dengue fever. but secondary infection with another serotype carries a higher risk of increased disease severity, causing life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (dhf/dss). serotype cross-reactive antibodies facilitate denv infection in fc-receptor-bearing cells by promoting virus entry via fcγ receptors (fcγr), a process known as antibody dependent enhancement (ade). most studies suggested that enhancing antibodies were mainly specific to the structural premembrane protein (prm) of denv. however, there is still no effective drugs or vaccines to prevent ade. in this study, we firstly confirmed that both denv-2 infected human sera (anti-denv-2) and denv-2 prm monoclonal antibody (prm mab) could significantly enhance denv-1 infection in k562 cells. then we developed anti-idiotypic antibodies (prm-aids) specific to prm mab by immunizing of balb/c mice. results showed that these polyclonal antibodies can dramatically reduce ade phenomenon of denv-1 infection in k562 cells. to further confirm the anti-ade effect of prm-aids in vivo, interferon-α and γ receptor-deficient mice (ag6) were used as the mouse model for denv infection. we found that administration of denv-2 prm mab indeed caused a higher denv-1 titer as well as interleukin-10 (il-10) and alaninea minotransferase (alt) in mice infected with denv-1, similar to clinical ade symptoms. but when we supplemented prm-aids to denv-1 challenged ag6 mice, the viral titer, il-10 and alt were obviously decreased to the negative control level. of note, the number of platelets in peripheral blood of prm-aids group were significantly increased at day 3 post infection with denv-1 compared that of prm-mab group. these results confirmed that our prm-aids could prevent ade not only in vitro but also in vivo, suggested that anti-idiotypic antibodies might be a new choice to be considered to treat denv infection.  thrombocytopenia is common in patients with dengue virus (denv) infections. with a focus on understanding the possible mechanism of thrombocytopenia in denv infections we described a direct correlation between activation and depletion of platelets in patients. our data showed a sharp decrease in platelet counts at day 4 of fever in patients. the high denv genome copies in platelets correlated directly with the elevated platelet activation along with increased binding of complement factor c3 and igg on their surface at day 4. recovery in platelet count was observed on day 10 through day 6 and 8 with simultaneous decrease in platelet activation markers. further, our in vitro data supported the above observations describing a concentration-dependent increase in platelet activation by denv serotype-2. the high copy number of denv2 genome in the platelet pellet correlated directly with platelet activation, microparticle generation and clot formation. furthermore the denv2-activated platelets were phagocytosed in large numbers by the monocytes. the denv2-mediated lysis and clearance of platelets were abrogated in presence of platelet activation inhibitor, prostacyclin. these observations collectively suggest that platelet activation status is an important determinant of thrombocytopenia in dengue infections. a careful strategy of inactivation of platelets may rescue them from rapid destruction during denv infections.
rna-binding proteins (rbps) control rna fate from synthesis to decay. since their cellular expression levels frequently do not reflect their in vivo activity, methods are needed to assess the steady state rna-binding activity of rbps as well as their responses to stimuli. while electrophoresis mobility shift assays (emsa) have been used for such determinations, their results serve at best as proxies for the rbp activities in living cells. here, we describe a quantitative dual fluorescence method to analyze protein-mrna interactions in vivo. known or candidate rbps are fused to fluorescent proteins (egfp, yfp), expressed in cells, cross-linked in vivo to rna by ultraviolet light irradiation, and immunoprecipitated, after lysis, with a single chain antibody fragment directed against egfp (gfp-binding protein, gbp). polyadenylated rna-binding activity of fusion proteins is assessed by hybridization with an oligo(dt) probe coupled with a red fluorophore. since uv light is directly applied to living cells, the assay can be used to monitor dynamic changes in rna-binding activities in response to biological or pharmacological stimuli. notably, immunoprecipitation and hybridization can also be performed with commercially available gbp-coupled 96-well plates (gfp-multitrap), allowing highly parallel rna-binding measurements in a single experiment. therefore, this method creates the possibility to conduct in vivo high-throughput rna-binding assays. we believe that this fast and simple radioactivity-free method will find many useful applications in rna biology.  ultraviolet (uv) irradiation can initiate complex formation between proteins and dna or rna and so can be used to study such interactions. however, crosslink formation by standard uv light sources can take up to several hours. more recently, a beam of monochromatic uv light from a laser has been used to initiate crosslinking in nano- and picosecond time intervals. as noted in an earlier tibs article 'the advantages of short pulse times and high-energy fluxes should make this a valuable technique in the future'. in this review we characterize laser-induced crosslinking and explore the applications of this method.
item-to-item collaborative filtering (aka.item-based cf) has been long used for building recommender systems in industrial settings, owing to its interpretability and efficiency in real-time personalization. it builds a user's profile as her historically interacted items, recommending new items that are similar to the user's profile. as such, the key to an item-based cf method is in the estimation of item similarities. early approaches use statistical measures such as cosine similarity and pearson coefficient to estimate item similarities, which are less accurate since they lack tailored optimization for the recommendation task. in recent years, several works attempt to learn item similarities from data, by expressing the similarity as an underlying model and estimating model parameters by optimizing a recommendation-aware objective function. while extensive efforts have been made to use shallow linear models for learning item similarities, there has been relatively less work exploring nonlinear neural network models for item-based cf. in this work, we propose a neural network model named neural attentive item similarity model (nais) for item-based cf. the key to our design of nais is an attention network, which is capable of distinguishing which historical items in a user profile are more important for a prediction. compared to the state-of-the-art item-based cf method factored item similarity model (fism) [1] , our nais has stronger representation power with only a few additional parameters brought by the attention network. extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of nais. this work is the first attempt that designs neural network models for item-based cf, opening up new research possibilities for future developments of neural recommender systems.  we present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. we describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. we give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. we experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.
recommender systems have been widely advocated as a way of coping with the problem of information overload for knowledge workers. given this, multiple recommendation methods have been developed. however, it has been shown that no one technique is best for all users in all situations. thus we believe that effective recommender systems should incorporate a wide variety of such techniques and that some form of overarching framework should be put in place to coordinate the various recommendations so that only the best of them (from whatever source) are presented to the user. to this end, we show that a marketplace, in which the various recommendation methods compete to offer their recommendations to the user, can be used in this role. specifically, this article presents the principled design of such a marketplace (including the auction protocol, the reward mechanism, and the bidding strategies of the individual recommendation agents) and evaluates the market's capability to effectively coordinate multiple methods. through analysis and simulation, we show that our market is capable of shortlisting recommendations in decreasing order of user perceived quality and of correlating the individual agent's internal quality rating to the user's perceived quality.  we have designed, implemented, deployed and evaluated a large-scale agent-oriented information system that recommends relevant documents to users. our recommender system is now being used across several european institutions. its two key features are a modular design capable of accomodating multiple recommendation methods, and the use of a marketplace to select and rank the best recommendations for the user. as part of our evaluation, we have extensively simulated this marketplace in order to understand its dynamics and validate its suitability for a reeommender system.
we developed a series of models for the label decay in cell proliferation assays when the intracellular dye carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (cfse) is used as a staining agent. data collected from two healthy patients were used to validate the models and to compare the models with the akiake information criteria. the distinguishing features of multiple decay rates in the data are readily characterized and explained via time dependent decay models such as the logistic and gompertz models.  in most biological studies and processes, cell proliferation and population dynamics play an essential role. due to this ubiquity, a multitude of mathematical models has been developed to describe these processes. while the simplest models only consider the size of the overall populations, others take division numbers and labeling of the cells into account. in this work, we present a modeling and computational framework for proliferating cell populations undergoing symmetric cell division, which incorporates both the discrete division number and continuous label dynamics. thus, it allows for the consideration of division number-dependent parameters as well as the direct comparison of the model prediction with labeling experiments, e.g., performed with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (cfse), and can be shown to be a generalization of most existing models used to describe these data. we prove that under mild assumptions the resulting system of coupled partial differential equations (pdes) can be decomposed into a system of ordinary differential equations (odes) and a set of decoupled pdes, which drastically reduces the computational effort for simulating the model. furthermore, the pdes are solved analytically and the ode system is truncated, which allows for the prediction of the label distribution of complex systems using a low-dimensional system of odes. in addition to modeling the label dynamics, we link the label-induced fluorescence to the measure fluorescence which includes autofluorescence. furthermore, we provide an analytical approximation for the resulting numerically challenging convolution integral. this is illustrated by modeling and simulating a proliferating population with division number-dependent proliferation rate.
recently, double-gate mosfets (dgmosfets) have been shown to be more optimal for ultra-low power circuit design due to the improved subthreshold slope and the reduced leakage current compared to bulk cmos. however, dgmosfets for subthreshold circuit design have not been much explored in comparison to those for strong inversion-based design. in this paper, various configurations of dgmosfets, such as tied/independent gates and symmetric/asymmetric gate oxide thickness are explored for ultra-low power and high efficient radio frequency identification (rfid) design. comparison of bulk cmos with dgmosfets has been conducted in ultra-low power subthreshold digital logic design and rectifier design, emphasizing the scope of the nano-scale dgmosfet technology for future ultra-low power systems. the dgmosfet-based subthreshold logic improves energy efficiency by more than 40% compared to the bulk cmos-based logic at 32 nm. among the various dgmosfet configurations for rfid rectifiers, symmetric tied-gate dgmosfet has the best power conversion efficiency and the lowest power consumption.  subthreshold region of operation has gained wide research interest for applications requiring ultra low power consumption and medium frequency of operation. double gate mosfets are proved to be better candidates for subthreshold operation due to their near ideal subthreshold slope and negligible gate capacitance. however it is not yet clear whether symmetric (sdg) or asymmetric (adg) dg with options of tied (3t) and independent gates (4t) are optimal for subthreshold circuit design. in this paper, we compare the performance characteristics of sdg and adg circuits with tied(3t) and independent gate(4t) options for the subthreshold logic by applying them to some basic logic gates such as nand, nor gates for the 32nm technology node. we also present the performance comparisons of sdg and adg circuits for subthreshold logic in the presence of supply voltage and temperature variations. we found that 3t adg circuits offer approximately 13–14% better power consumption, 4–5% better speed and 16–18.3% better pdp than 3tsdg based circuits.
traditional machine translation evaluation metrics such as bleu and wer have been widely used, but these metrics have poor correlations with human judgements because they badly represent word similarity and impose strict identity matching. in this paper, we propose some modifications to the traditional measures based on word embeddings for these two metrics. the evaluation results show that our modifications significantly improve their correlation with human judgements.  a goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. this is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. we propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. the model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. we report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.
qili qiangxin (ql) capsule is a traditional chinese medicine that is widely used for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure (chf) of all etiologies, although the exact mechanisms of action remain unclear. chf leads to pulmonary vascular remodelling and thickening of the alveolar-capillary barrier that may be important mechanisms in the poor clinical outcome in patients with end-stage heart failure. we examined whether ql could improve lung injury in ischemic chf by reducing lung remodeling. rats with myocardial infarct received ql (1.0 g/kg/day) for 4 weeks. echocardiographic and morphometric measurements were obtained followed by echocardiography, histological staining, and immunohistochemical analysis of lung sections. chf caused significant lung structural remodeling evidenced by collagen deposition and thickening of the alveolar septa after myocardial infarct that were greatly improved by ql. lung weight increased after infarct with no evidence of pulmonary edema and was normalized by ql. ql also reduced lung transforming growth factor-β1 (tgf-β1), p-smad3, tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α), and toll-like receptor-4 (tlr4) expression. thus, ql reduces lung remodeling associated with chf, mainly by suppressing the tgf-β1/smad3 signaling pathway. the mechanism may also involve inhibition of tlr4 intracellular signaling.  background cytokine activation in the myocardium of deteriorating patients with heart failure who undergo left ventricular assist-device (lvad) implantation has been documented, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. we hypothesized the innate immune system is activated with expression of toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4), leading to cytokine activation in these patients.   methods we used quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to measure tlr4, interleukin-1 (il-1) receptor, il-1 beta, il-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) mrna expression in myocardial samples from 36 patients. we compared 18 patients who underwent lvad implantation with 18 patients with less severe heart failure who underwent elective heart transplantation.   results toll-like receptor 4 expression was 1.69-fold greater (p < 0.05) and il-1 receptor expression was 3.64-fold greater (p < 0.0001) in the deteriorating patients who required lvads. myocardial tnf-alpha (1.71-fold, p < 0.05), il-6 (2.57-fold, p < 0.005), and il-1 beta (9.78-fold, p < 0.001) also were increased in the lvad candidates. toll-like receptor 4 expression correlated strongly with il-1 receptor expression (r= 0.75, p < 0.0001) and with il-1 beta expression in individual patients (r = 0.7, p < 0.0001). interleukin-1 receptor expression also correlated with il-1 beta expression (r = 0.78, p < 0.0001) within patients. we found no correlation between tlr4 and either tnf-alpha or il-6 expression.   conclusions patients who required lvad support showed evidence of innate immune system activation, indicated by an increase in the key effector molecule tlr4 associated with a specific pattern of cytokine expression in the myocardium.
background older adults represent a growing percentage of the united states (us) population living with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). the emergency department plays an integral role in the identification and initial evaluation and treatment of patients with hiv.   objective we sought to estimate the number of hospitalizations of older adults (age ≥ 50 years) with hiv in the united states from 2000 to 2006 and compare features of this population to younger adults with hiv. clinical and demographic characteristics of the younger cohort (19-49 years) and two older cohorts (ages 50-64 and ≥ 65 years) were examined and compared.   methods data from the nationwide inpatient sample was used to compare the three groups of hiv-positive patients. comparisons between the most common discharge diagnoses and primary procedures were also made.   results older adults with hiv constitute almost one quarter of the hospitalizations of adults with hiv. older adults with hiv were more likely to be male, have a significantly higher average hospital charge, and have a longer length of stay than younger adults with hiv. pneumonia and fluid and electrolyte disorders were common diagnoses among all three age cohorts.   conclusions older hiv patients were more likely to die during hospitalization compared with younger adults with hiv and older adults without hiv. admissions for older hiv patients almost doubled during the study period and future studies should examine whether this is due to aging of the current hiv population or new infections.  objectives: to alert persons in the public and private healthcare professions to the increasing trends in higher proportions of persons aged 50 and older who are newly diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and who are living with hiv and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids).
the rapid evolution of venom toxin genes is often explained as the result of a biochemical arms race between venomous animals and their prey. however, it is not clear that an arms race analogy is appropriate in this context because there is no published evidence for rapid evolution in genes that might confer toxin resistance among routinely envenomed species. here we report such evidence from an unusual predator-prey relationship between opossums (marsupialia: didelphidae) and pitvipers (serpentes: crotalinae). in particular, we found high ratios of replacement to silent substitutions in the gene encoding von willebrand factor (vwf), a venom-targeted hemostatic blood protein, in a clade of opossums known to eat pitvipers and to be resistant to their hemorrhagic venom. observed amino-acid substitutions in venom-resistant opossums include changes in net charge and hydrophobicity that are hypothesized to weaken the bond between vwf and one of its toxic snake-venom ligands, the c-type lectin-like protein botrocetin. our results provide the first example of rapid adaptive evolution in any venom-targeted molecule, and they support the notion that an evolutionary arms race might be driving the rapid evolution of snake venoms. however, in the arms race implied by our results, venomous snakes are prey, and their venom has a correspondingly defensive function in addition to its usual trophic role.  the ligand binding site of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (acchor) is localized in the alpha-subunit within a domain containing the tandem cys-192 and -193. by analyzing the binding-site region of acchor from animal species that are resistant to alpha-neurotoxins, we have previously shown that four residues in this region, at positions 187, 189, 194, and 197, differ between animals sensitive (e.g., mouse) and resistant (e.g., mongoose and snake) to alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-btx). in the present study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on a fragment of the mongoose acchor alpha-subunit (residues 122-205) and exchanged residues 187, 189, 194, and 197, either alone or in combination, with those present in the mouse alpha-subunit sequence. only the mongoose fragment in which all four residues were mutated to the mouse ones exhibited alpha-btx binding similar to that of the mouse fragment. the mongoose double mutation in which leu-194 and his-197 were replaced with proline residues, which are present at these positions in the mouse acchor and in all other toxin binders, bound alpha-btx to approximately 60% of the level of binding exhibited by the mouse fragment. in addition, replacement of either pro-194 or -197 in the mouse fragment with serine and histidine, respectively, markedly decreased alpha-btx binding. all other mutations resulted in no or just a small increase in alpha-btx binding. these results have led us to propose two subsites in the binding domain for alpha-btx: the proline subsite, which includes pro-194 and -197 and is critical for alpha-btx binding, and the aromatic subsite, which includes amino acid residues 187 and 189 and determines the extent of alpha-btx binding.
purposeeicosapentaenoic acid (epa) has been reported to augment endothelial function and improve clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (cad). the purpose of this study was to determine whether epa could improve residual endothelial dysfunction despite adequate lipid-lowering with statin in cad patients.methodseighty patients with established cad, who had been on statin treatment and had serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) levels <100 mg/dl, were randomly assigned to receive either 1,800 mg of epa daily plus statin (epa group, n = 40) or statin alone (control group, n = 40). lipid profiles and flow-mediated dilation (fmd) were assessed just before and after more than 3 months of treatment in both groups. only patients who had impaired fmd (<6 %) before randomization were enrolled.resultsafter treatment for 5.2 ± 1.7 months, the epa group showed a significant increase in the serum concentration of epa and epa to arachidonic acid (aa) (epa/aa) ratio (62.5 ± 38.1 to 159.8 ± 53.8 μg/ml, 0.45 ± 0.34 to 1.20 ± 0.55, p < 0.01 for both). in the epa group, serum triglycerides significantly decreased (150.7 ± 92.9 to 119.3 ± 60.7 mg/dl, p = 0.02), whereas no significant change was seen in the control group. fmd, the primary study endpoint, showed a significant improvement in the epa group (2.6 ± 1.6 % to 3.2 ± 1.6 %, p = 0.02), whereas no significant change was observed in the control group (2.7 ± 1.6 % to 2.4 ± 1.7 %, p = 0.29).conclusionsepa improved endothelial function and impaired fmd in patients with established cad who were on optimal statin therapy.  endothelial function is thought to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, hypertension and heart failure. in the 1990s, high-frequency ultrasonographic imaging of the brachial artery to assess endothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilation (fmd) was developed. the technique provokes the release of nitric oxide, resulting in vasodilation that can be quantitated as an index of vasomotor function. the noninvasive nature of the technique allows repeated measurements over time to study the effectiveness of various interventions that may affect vascular health. however, despite its widespread use, there are technical and interpretive limitations of this technique. state-of-the-art information is presented and insights are provided into the strengths and limitations of high-resolution ultrasonography of the brachial artery to evaluate vasomotor function, with guidelines for its research application in the study of endothelial physiology.
under intracellular recording, we studied the effect of atp on nerve cells of the rat intact nodose ganglion. the resting membrane potential of the examined neurons was, on average, –60.3 ± 1.4 mv (n = 84); among such units, 88% were classified as c cells. local application of 2 mm atp to the surface of the ganglion using a modified laminar flow system led to depolarization of neurons by 7.1 ± 0.9 mv, on average (n = 19). a blocker of p2x receptors, ppads (100 μm), suppressed these depolarization responses, decreasing their amplitude, on average, to 16 ± 3% (n = 3) of the initial value. the obtained data indicate that an overwhelming majority of neurons of the intact nodose ganglion possess functional p2x receptors on their membranes. the absence of the corresponding responses in a considerable part of neurons of intact spinal ganglia [13-15] was, apparently, determined by the fact that p2x receptors in the course of the described experiments had enough time to desensitize before atp reached the effective concentration.  the effects of divalent cations on responses to 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5‐ht), gamma‐aminobutyric acid (gaba) and 1,1‐dimethyl‐4‐phenyl piperazinium (dmpp) were investigated using a sucrose‐gap method to record population responses. in ca‐free medium responses to 5‐ht were enhanced, those to dmpp depressed and those to gaba unchanged. in mg‐free medium responses to 5‐ht were unchanged, while those to dmpp and gaba were depressed. removal of both ca and mg from the superfusion medium caused a small reduction of gaba responses and a large reduction of dmpp responses. responses to 5‐ht were not only greatly potentiated but were changed in character; the depolarizing phase became sigmoid and the dose dependence between quantity of 5‐ht and response magnitude was lost as if 5‐ht were triggering an all‐or‐nothing phenomenon. dose‐‐response relationships for gaba were normal in the large majority of preparations. in about 10% of preparations, supramaximal amounts of gaba or dmpp evoked large responses of a similar character to those evoked by 5‐ht. the large responses, generated by an unknown mechanism, were termed x responses. further reduction in tissue divalent cations by egta (1 mm) caused x responses to be generated spontaneously. ca, mg, mn or co (1 mm) could suppress x responses. dmpp responses, reduced in ca/mg‐free medium, were largely restored by 1 mm‐ca. depression of gaba responses in ca/mg‐free medium could be entirely attributed to the absence of mg, mn being able to substitute for mg. x responses were generated only after equilibration for 1 h with ca/mg‐free medium. attempts to manipulate [ca]i with dinitrophenol or caffeine did not produce the conditions under which x responses were generated. intracellular records of responses to 5‐ht, gaba or dmpp showed that cells with a fibres responded to gaba but not to 5‐ht or dmpp. fifty‐four out of sixty‐seven cells with c fibre axons (80%) were depolarized by 5‐ht, thirty‐seven out of forty‐nine (76%) by dmpp and forty out of fifty‐seven (70%) by gaba. eighteen out of thirty‐eight (47%) c cells were depolarized by all three agents. some c cells were very sensitive to 5‐ht, 10(‐6) m evoking a substantial response. in most, responses to 10(‐5) m‐5‐ht had a slower rate of rise than responses to 10(‐4) or 10(‐3) m‐gaba or dmpp, yet lower 5‐ht concentrations normally elicited x responses in sucrose‐gap experiments whereas gaba or dmpp normally did not.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
summaryobjectives:this article is the last in a series of four that present data about physical activity in 15 members states of the european union collected by the eurobarometer 58.2. the focus of this article is on the perception of environmental opportunities for physical activity across the european union.  methods:data were collected in 2002 as part of the eurobarometer by face-to-face interviews. a total of 16230 respondents age 15 years and older were interviewed. sample sizes ranged about 1000 respondents in most nations. physical activity was assessed with the last 7-days short version of the international physical activity questionnaire (ipaq).  results:results indicate relationships between the perceptions of environmental opportunities; gross household income and physical activity level (in met-hours/per week) of respondents. respondents who reported lower income and less physical activity had also more negative perceptions of environmental opportunities. across nations, respondents in denmark, the netherlands, luxembourg, and western germany had the highest satisfaction with environmental opportunities for physical activity. in some nations, positive correlations between the perception of environmental opportunities and physical activity levels could be observed.  conclusions:results show variations in the perception of environmental opportunities across the eu. overall, the majority of respondents rated their environmental opportunities for physical activity favourable.  physically active lifestyles are regularly associated with improved health and quality of life. differences in lifestyles in society can partly be understood through the differences in the social and physical environment. this study examines the relationships between reported physical activity, and the extent of perceived support for physical activity in the physical and policy environment (e.g. facilities, programmes and other opportunities), and in the social environment. the data for the study come from a cross-cultural health policy study called mareps. in total, 3342 adults, 18 years or older, from six countries (belgium, finland, germany, the netherlands, spain, switzerland) were interviewed via telephone. respondents were categorised as active or inactive according to self-reported physical activity. social environmental factors and physical and policy environmental factors were also assessed. the analysis of the data was informed by social cognitive theory, although the study was not originally designed for this purpose. sixty-eight percent of females and 70% of males were active. the proportions of active and inactive varied by countries to a great extent. the strongest independent predictor of being physically active was social environment. those who perceived low social support from their personal environment (i.e. family, friends, school and workplace) were more than twice as likely to be sedentary compared to those who reported high social support from their personal environment. specific knowledge of the programmes and actions for physical activity and sport was also a strong predictor of being active. a supportive physical and policy environment was not associated with participation in physical activity as strongly as had been anticipated. the variation between countries was stronger predictor of being active than the physical and policy environment variables. this study generates the hypotheses and raises the questions that in a preliminary way, there appears to be some relationships between aspects of physical and social environment and physical activity participation. however, future research is needed to refine and clarify this.
mathematics ability and disability is as heritable as other cognitive abilities and disabilities, however its genetic etiology has received relatively little attention. in our recent genome-wide association study of mathematical ability in 10-year-old children, 10 snp associations were nominated from scans of pooled dna and validated in an individually genotyped sample. in this paper, we use a ‘snp set’ composite of these 10 snps to investigate gene-environment (ge) interaction, examining whether the association between the 10-snp set and mathematical ability differs as a function of ten environmental measures in the home and school in a sample of 1888 children with complete data. we found two significant ge interactions for environmental measures in the home and the school both in the direction of the diathesis-stress type of ge interaction: the 10-snp set was more strongly associated with mathematical ability in chaotic homes and when parents are negative.  the twins early development study (teds) focuses on the early development of the three most common psychological problems in childhood: communication disorders, mild mental impairment and behavior problems. the teds twins were assessed longitudinally at 2, 3, 4 and 7 years of age in order to investigate genetic and environmental contributions to change and continuity in language and cognitive development; it is multivariate in order to examine the origins of comorbidity; and it uses a large sample in order to study abnormal development in the context of normal development. the twins were identified from birth records of twins born in the uk in 1994-96. more than 15,000 pairs of twins have been enrolled in teds and the participating families are representative of the uk. the measures at 2, 3 and 4 years are administered by parents. at 7 years, children are assessed for language and cognitive development using telephone testing, parents and children are interviewed about behavior problems, and teachers also assess behavior problems as well as academic achievement. one set of findings is that the same genes largely contribute to both language and cognitive problems and the same genes affect normal and abnormal development, a result that suggests that general impairment may be a better target for genetic research than specific language impairment independent of nonverbal cognitive problems. dna has been obtained so far for more than 4000 pairs and is being used initially in molecular genetic studies of language problems and hyperactivity.
dependability is getting a more important non-functional p roperty of a system. measuring and predicting the dependability is especially important for autonomous or se mi-autonomous and safety-critical systems. since, at least for (semi-) autonomous systems, those systems are u ually described by their behavior, a definition for dependability based on the behavior of the system is evident . in this paper the behavioral based definition of dependability was used together with a particle filter to est imate the dependability of an autonomous mobile system.  dependability is widely understood as an integrated concept that consists of different attributes. the set of attributes and requirements of each attribute varies from application to application thus making it very challenging to define dependability for a broad amount of application. the dependability, however, is of great importance when dealing with autonomous or semi-autonomous systems, thus defining dependability for those kind of system is vital. such autonomous mobile system are usually described by their behavior. in this paper a minimum set of attributes for the dependability of autonomous mobile systems is proposed based on a behavioral definition of dependability.
background & aims little is known about the optimal management of patients with chronic hepatitis b (chb) who developed multiple-drug resistance.   methods we assessed 91 patients with compensated chb who developed adefovir-resistant mutations during adefovir monotherapy for lamivudine-resistant chb. of these, 41 were treated with a combination of lamivudine plus adefovir (lam+adv group) and 50 were treated with entecavir monotherapy (etv group).   results there were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics, including serum hbv dna levels (p>0.05). the rate of virologic non-response (hbv dna reduction <1 log(10) iu/ml at 6 months) was significantly greater in the lam+adv than in the etv group (51.2% vs. 16.0%, p<0.01). at 12 months, hbv dna declined less in the lam+adv than in the etv group (-1.49+/-1.78 vs. -3.47+/-2.13 log(10) iu/ml, p<0.01). only 12.2% and 22.0% of patients in the lam+adv and etv groups, respectively, achieved complete virologic response (hbv dna <60 iu/ml) at 12 months. multivariable analysis showed that lam+adv group (or=0.08, ci=0.02-0.28) and the presence of the rta181v/t mutation (or=0.21, ci=0.05-0.91) were independently associated with a decreased rate of virologic response (hbv dna <2000 iu/ml) at 12 months.   conclusions in patients with chb resistant to lamivudine and adefovir, combination therapy with these two drugs was not effective and was inferior to entecavir monotherapy in suppressing hbv dna. however, the response to entecavir monotherapy was also not optimal. these results emphasize the importance of preventing the development of multidrug-resistant hbv and of exploration for adequate combination therapy in treatment of multidrug-resistant chb.  multi‐drug resistant hepatitis b virus (hbv) has been reported in hepatitis b patients who received sequential antiviral therapy. in vitro studies showed that hbv constructs with mutations resistant to lamivudine and adefovir have marked reduction in sensitivity to combination of lamivudine and adefovir, whereas constructs with mutations resistant to either drug remain sensitive to the other drug. we conducted this study to determine whether mutations conferring resistance to multiple antiviral agents co‐locate on the same hbv genome in vivo and to describe the evolution of these mutations. sera from six patients who had been found to have multi‐drug resistant hbv mutations to lamivudine + adefovir, lamivudine + hepatitis b immunoglobulin (hbig), or lamivudine + entecavir on direct sequencing were cloned after nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr). analysis of 215 clones from 11 samples with multi‐drug resistant mutations on direct sequencing showed that 183 (85%) clones had mutations to both therapies on the same genome; 31 clones had lamivudine‐resistant mutants only. clonal analysis of serial samples from three patients showed progressive evolution from all clones with lamivudine‐resistant hbv mutations only to mixtures of clones that have multi‐drug resistant mutations and clones that have lamivudine‐resistant hbv mutations only, and ultimately all clones having multi‐drug resistant hbv mutations. in conclusion, mutations conferring resistance to multiple antiviral agents co‐locate on the same viral genome, suggesting that combination therapy directed against mutants resistant to each treatment may not be adequate in suppressing multi‐drug resistant hbv. de novo combination therapy may prevent the emergence of multi‐drug resistant mutants.

metamorphic testing is a testing technique that can be used to verify the functional correctness of software in the absence of an ideal oracle. this paper extends metamorphic testing into a user-oriented approach to software verification, validation, and quality assessment, and conducts large scale empirical studies with four major web search engines: google, bing, chinese bing, and baidu. these search engines are very difficult to test and assess using conventional approaches owing to the lack of an objective and generally recognized oracle. the results are useful for both search engine developers and users, and demonstrate that our approach can effectively alleviate the oracle problem and challenges surrounding a lack of specifications when verifying, validating, and evaluating large and complex software systems.  metamorphic testing (mt) is an effective methodology for testing those so-called ``non-testable'' programs (e.g., scientific programs), where it is sometimes very difficult for testers to know whether the outputs are correct. in metamorphic testing, metamorphic relations (mrs) (which specify how particular changes to the input of the program under test would change the output) play an essential role. however, testers may typically have to obtain mrs manually. in this paper, we propose a search-based approach to automatic inference of polynomial mrs for a program under test. in particular, we use a set of parameters to represent a particular class of mrs, which we refer to as polynomial mrs, and turn the problem of inferring mrs into a problem of searching for suitable values of the parameters. we then dynamically analyze multiple executions of the program, and use particle swarm optimization to solve the search problem. to improve the quality of inferred mrs, we further use mr filtering to remove some inferred mrs. we also conducted three empirical studies to evaluate our approach using four scientific libraries (including 189 scientific functions). from our empirical results, our approach is able to infer many high-quality mrs in acceptable time (i.e., from 9.87 seconds to 1231.16 seconds), which are effective in detecting faults with no false detection.
depression is common, especially in women of child-bearing age; prevalence estimates for this group range from 8% to 12%, and there is robust evidence that maternal depression is associated with mental health problems in offspring. suicidal behaviour is a growing concern amongst young people and those exposed to maternal depression are likely to be especially at high risk. the aim of this study was to utilise a large, prospective population cohort to examine the relationship between depression symptom trajectories in mothers over the first eleven years of their child’s life and subsequent adolescent suicidal ideation. an additional aim was to test if associations were explained by maternal suicide attempt and offspring depressive disorder. data were utilised from a population-based birth cohort: the avon longitudinal study of parents and children. maternal depression symptoms were assessed repeatedly from pregnancy to child age 11 years. offspring suicidal ideation was assessed at age 16 years. using multiple imputation, data for 10,559 families were analysed. using latent class growth analysis, five distinct classes of maternal depression symptoms were identified (minimal, mild, increasing, sub-threshold, chronic-severe). the prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation at age 16 years was 15% (95% ci: 14-17%). compared to offspring of mothers with minimal symptoms, the greatest risk of suicidal ideation was found for offspring of mothers with chronic-severe symptoms [or 3.04 (95% ci 2.19, 4.21)], with evidence for smaller increases in risk of suicidal ideation in offspring of mothers with sub-threshold, increasing and mild symptoms. these associations were not fully accounted for by maternal suicide attempt or offspring depression diagnosis. twenty-six percent of non-depressed offspring of mothers with chronic-severe depression symptoms reported suicidal ideation. risk for suicidal ideation should be considered in young people whose mothers have a history of sustained high levels of depression symptoms, even when the offspring themselves do not have a depression diagnosis.  the development of a 10-item self-report scale (epds) to screen for postnatal depression in the community is described. after extensive pilot interviews a validation study was carried out on 84 mothers using the research diagnostic criteria for depressive illness obtained from goldberg's standardised psychiatric interview. the epds was found to have satisfactory sensitivity and specificity, and was also sensitive to change in the severity of depression over time. the scale can be completed in about 5 minutes and has a simple method of scoring. the use of the epds in the secondary prevention of postnatal depression is discussed.
background myostatin is a muscle derived factor that functions as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. induction of myostatin expression was observed in rodent models of muscle wasting and in cachectic patients with cancer or pulmonary disease. therefore, there is an increasing interest to use serum myostatin as a biomarker. methods we established an immunoradiometric sandwich assay (irma), which uses a commercially available chicken polyclonal, affinity purified antibody directed against human myostatin prodomain. we determined the serum concentrations of myostatin prodomain in 249 healthy individuals as well as 169 patients with heart failure, 53 patients with cancer and 44 patients with chronic pulmonary disease. results the irma had a detection limit of 0.7ng/ml, an intraassay imprecision of ≤14.1% and an interassay imprecision of ≤ 18.9%. the specificity of our assay was demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography, detection of myostatin by western-blotting and a smad-dependent transcriptional-reporter assay in the signal-rich serum fractions, as well as lack of interference by unspecific substances like albumin, hemoglobin or lipids. myostatin prodomain was stable at room temperature and resistant to freeze-thaw cycles. apparently healthy individuals over the age of 55 had a median myostatin prodomain serum concentration of 3.9ng/ml (25th-75th percentiles, 2-7ng/ml) and we could not detect increased levels in patients with stable chronic heart failure or cancer related weight loss. in contrast, we found strongly elevated concentrations of myostatin prodomain (median 26.9ng/ml, 25th-75th percentiles, 7-100ng/ml) in the serum of underweight patients with chronic pulmonary disease. conclusions we established a highly specific irma for the quantification of myostatin prodomain concentration in human serum. our assay could be useful to study myostatin as a biomarker for example in patients with chronic pulmonary disease, as we detected highly elevated myostatin prodomain serum levels in underweight individuals of this group.  humoral and tumoral factors collectively promote cancer-induced skeletal muscle wasting by increasing protein degradation. although several humoral proteins, namely tnfα (tumour necrosis factor α) and il (interleukin)-6, have been shown to induce skeletal muscle wasting, there is a lack of information regarding the tumoral factors that contribute to the atrophy of muscle during cancer cachexia. therefore, in the present study, we have characterized the secretome of c26 colon cancer cells to identify the tumoral factors involved in cancer-induced skeletal muscle wasting. in the present study, we show that myostatin, a procachectic tgfβ (transforming growth factor β) superfamily member, is abundantly secreted by c26 cells. consistent with myostatin signalling during cachexia, treating differentiated c2c12 myotubes with c26 cm (conditioned medium) resulted in myotubular atrophy due to the up-regulation of muscle-specific e3 ligases, atrogin-1 and murf1 (muscle ring-finger protein 1), and enhanced activity of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. furthermore, the c26 cm also activated actriib (activin receptor type ii b)/smad and nf-κb (nuclear factor κb) signalling, and reduced the activity of the igf-i (insulin-like growth factor 1)/pi3k (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/akt pathway, three salient molecular features of myostatin action in skeletal muscles. antagonists to myostatin prevented c26 cm-induced wasting in muscle cell cultures, further confirming that tumoral myostatin may be a key contributor in the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia. finally, we show that treatment with c26 cm induced the autophagy–lysosome pathway and reduced the number of mitochondria in myotubes. these two previously unreported observations were recapitulated in skeletal muscles collected from c26 tumour-bearing mice.
background quercetin and trans-resveratrol (trans-rsv) are plant polyphenols reported to reduce inflammation or insulin resistance associated with obesity. recently, we showed that grape powder extract, which contains quercetin and trans-rsv, attenuates markers of inflammation in human adipocytes and macrophages and insulin resistance in human adipocytes. however, we do not know how quercetin and trans-rsv individually affected these outcomes.   objective the aim of this study was to examine the extent to which quercetin and trans-rsv prevented inflammation or insulin resistance in primary cultures of human adipocytes treated with tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α)-an inflammatory cytokine elevated in the plasma and adipose tissue of obese, diabetic individuals.   design cultures of human adipocytes were pretreated with quercetin and trans-rsv followed by treatment with tnf-α. subsequently, gene and protein markers of inflammation and insulin resistance were measured.   results quercetin, and to a lesser extent trans-rsv, attenuated the tnf-α-induced expression of inflammatory genes such as interleukin (il)-6, il-1β, il-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1) and the secretion of il-6, il-8, and mcp-1. quercetin attenuated tnf-α-mediated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase and c-jun-nh₂ terminal kinase, whereas trans-rsv attenuated only c-jun-nh₂ terminal kinase phosphorylation. quercetin and trans-rsv attenuated tnf-α-mediated phosphorylation of c-jun and degradation of inhibitory κb protein. quercetin, but not trans-rsv, decreased tnf-α-induced nuclear factor-κb transcriptional activity. quercetin and trans-rsv attenuated the tnf-α-mediated suppression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (pparγ) and pparγ target genes and of pparγ protein concentrations and transcriptional activity. quercetin prevented the tnf-α-mediated serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and protein tyrosine phosphatase-1b gene expression and the suppression of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, whereas trans-rsv prevented only the tnf-α-mediated serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1.   conclusion these data suggest that quercetin is equally or more effective than trans-rsv in attenuating tnf-α-mediated inflammation and insulin resistance in primary human adipocytes.  the facilitative glucose transporter, glut4, mediates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes and muscles, and the participation of glut4 in the pathogenesis of various clinical conditions associated with obesity, visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance has been proposed. glucose uptake by some members of the glut family, mainly glut1, is inhibited by flavonoids, the natural polyphenols present in fruits, vegetables and wine. therefore it is of interest to establish if these polyphenolic compounds present in the diet, known to be effective antioxidants but also endowed with several other biological activities such as protein-tyrosine kinase inhibition, interfere with glut4 function. in the present study, we show that three flavonoids, quercetin, myricetin and catechin-gallate, inhibit the uptake of methylglucose by adipocytes over the concentration range of 10-100 microm. these three flavonoids show a competitive pattern of inhibition, with k(i)=16, 33.5 and 90 microm respectively. in contrast, neither catechin nor gallic acid inhibit methylglucose uptake. to obtain a better understanding of the interaction among glut4 and flavonoids, we have derived a glut4 three-dimensional molecular comparative model, using structural co-ordinates from a glut3 comparative model and a mechanosensitive ion channel [pdb (protein data bank) code 1msl] solved by x-ray diffraction. on the whole, the experimental evidence and computer simulation data favour a transport inhibition mechanism in which flavonoids and glut4 interact directly, rather than by a mechanism related to protein-tyrosine kinase and insulin signalling inhibition. furthermore, the results suggest that glut transporters are involved in flavonoid incorporation into cells.
background pharmacological intervention of redox balance in cancer cells often results in oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis, attracting much attention for the development of a new generation of targeted therapy in cancer. however, little is known about mechanisms underlying the conversion from oxidative signaling to downstream activities leading cells to death. methodology/principal findings we here report a systematic detection of transcriptome changes in response to oxidative signals generated in leukemia cells upon fenretinide treatment, implicating the occurrence of numerous stress-responsive events during the fenretinide induced apoptosis, such as redox response, endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response, translational repression and proteasome activation. moreover, the configuration of these relevant events is primarily orchestrated by stress responsive transcription factors, as typically highlighted by nf-e2-related factor-2 (nrf2) and heat shock factor 1 (hsf1). several lines of evidence suggest that the coordinated regulation of these transcription factors and thus their downstream genes are involved in converting oxidative signaling into downstream stress-responsive events regulating pro-apoptotic and apoptotic activities at the temporal and spatial levels, typifying oxidative stress-mediated programmed death rather than survival in cancer cells. conclusions/significance this study provides a roadmap for understanding oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells, which may be further developed into more sophisticated therapeutic protocols, as implicated by synergistic induction of cell apoptosis using proteasome inhibitors with fenretinide.  we describe a powerful approach, component plane presentation integrated self‐organizing map (som), for the analysis of microarray data. this approach allows the display of multi‐dimensional som outputs of microarray data in multiple sample specific presentations, providing distinct advantages in visual inspection of biological significances of genes clustered in each map unit with respect to each rna sample. beneficial potentials of the approach are highlighted by processing microarray data from yeast cells as well as human breast malignancies.
studies in adult mammals (rats, cats, mice, and humans) have revealed a surprising regularity in the duration of sleep and wake bouts. in particular, wake bout durations exhibit a power-law distribution whereas sleep bout durations exhibit an exponential distribution. moreover, in rodents, sleep bouts exhibit an exponential distribution at all ages examined, whereas wake bout durations exhibit exponential distributions early in ontogeny with a clear power-law emerging only at the older ages. thus, the data examined thus far suggests a similar developmental trajectory for a wide range of mammals which in turn may offer a novel metric to directly compare human and animal sleep–wake data. therefore, we tested the generalizability of these findings by examining the distributions of sleep and wake bouts during the night in a healthy human sample – from premature infants to 70-year-olds. we find that sleep bouts elongate over the first years. at the same time wake bouts shorten but elongate again with increasing age. moreover, sleep bout durations exhibit exponential distributions at all ages tested, except for the youngest (premature infants). wake bouts exhibit a power-law distribution – but only during a restricted time window during adulthood. we conclude that the developmental trajectory of human sleep–wake cycles does not map well onto those of rodents; however, the method of characterizing sleep–wake cycles, using bout distribution, holds great promise for classifying sleep, its disorders, and tracking its developmental milestones across the lifespan in humans.  the ontogenesis of sleep was studied in prematures from 32 to 41 weeks of gestational age the characteristics of the eeg, the patterns and rate of respiration, the cardiac rate, body motility comprised of localized and diffuse movements, localized and diffuse jerks, clonic movements and electromyo-graphic activity of the chin, as well as periods of total quietness were observed and correlated with the progressive organization of behavior in these infants. the data obtained at each gestational age, i.e., at 32–34 weeks, 35–37 weeks, and 38–41 weeks, were compared to those obtained in full-term newborns. the relationships between the different events and the features of the eeg and of the respiratory patterns were ascertained and compared to similar data obtained in the full-term newborn. this comparison shows that the premature at 40 weeks of gestational age has not attained a level of organization as high as that of the full-term newborn. an hypothesis suggesting a possible mechanism of this discrepancy is presented.
the purpose of this article is to investigate effective reformism: strategies that innovation networks deploy to create changes in their environment in order to establish a more conducive context for the realization and durable embedding of their innovation projects. using a case study approach, effective reformism efforts are analyzed in a technological innovation trajectory related to the implementation of a new poultry husbandry system and an organizational innovation trajectory concerning new ways of co-operation among individual farms to establish economies of scale. the findings reinforce the idea, emerging from a complexity perspective on agricultural innovation systems, that interaction between innovation networks and their environment is only steerable to a limited extent. nonetheless, innovation networks can enhance effective reformism by creating tangible visions that serve as vehicles to create understanding about the innovation and mobilize support for it, and by employing several kinds of boundary spanning individuals that are able to forge effective connections between innovation networks and their environment. because innovation networks can only partially influence their institutional environment, and because unintended consequences of actions and random events influence the course of the innovation process, innovation network actors need to continuously re-interpret the contexts in which they move. this constant reflection by the innovating actors on their position vis-a-vis their environment needs to be supported by dedicated facilitators and monitoring and evaluation methods aimed at system learning. this implies that agricultural innovation policies should, instead of aiming to fully plan and control innovation, foster the emergence of such flexible support instruments that enable adaptive innovation management.  transforum is an innovation program which aims to make a substantial contribution to the transition towards more sustainable development of the dutch agricultural sector. this article describes the scientific foundation and architecture of this program. transforum operates on the basis of five working hypotheses which together constitute one integrated analytical framework. these hypotheses are: (1) sustainable development is a dynamic system property; (2) sustainable development needs system innovation; (3) system innovation is a non-linear learning process; (4) system innovation requires active participation of relevant key players from knowledge institutes, governmental bodies, civil society organisations and the business community; (5) the program requires transdisciplinary collaboration of all players. transforum identifies three new innovation strategies: (1) vital clusters; (2) regional development; (3) international agro-food networks; as alternatives to the current arrangements. innovative projects are organised in these innovation strategies. the aim of the scientific program is threefold: (1) it addresses research questions raised in the innovative projects; (2) it investigates the need for system-innovations and the way in which they can be realized; (3) it designs research projects to test the 5 main working hypotheses of the program. the scientific program is organised in four themes following a cyclic innovation process which is constantly monitored. the cycle starts with people’s preferences and images, followed by studies on which inventions are required to achieve a successful innovation. subsequently, it is investigated how to organize new innovations and transitions and finally, how citizen/consumers behaviour and preferences mobilizes sustainable development, closing the loop.
in this paper, we addressed the named entity recognition (ner) problem for morphologically rich languages by employing a semi-supervised learning approach based on neural networks. we adopted a fast unsupervised method for learning continuous vector representations of words, and used these representations along with language independent features to develop a ner system. we evaluated our system for the highly inflectional turkish and czech languages. we improved the state-of-the-art f-score obtained for turkish without using gazetteers by 2.26% and for czech by 1.53%. unlike the previous state-of-the-art systems developed for these languages, our system does not make use of any language dependent features. therefore, we believe it can easily be applied to other morphologically rich languages.  in this paper, we present our effort to consolidate and push further the named entity recognition (ner) research for the czech language. the research in czech is based upon a non-standard basis. some systems are constructed to provide hierarchical outputs whereas the rests give flat entities. direct comparison among these system is therefore impossible. our first goal is to tackle this issue. we build our own ner system based upon conditional random fields (crf) model. it is constructed to output either flat or hierarchical named entities thus enabling an evaluation with all the known systems for czech language. we show a 3.5 – 11% absolute performance increase when compared to previously published results. as a last step we put our system in the context of the research for other languages. we show results for english, spanish and dutch corpora. we can conclude that our system provides solid results when compared to the foreign state of the art.
abstract we determined whether the increment in cardiac end-diastolic compliance (a reduced diastolic stiffness constant) following endurance training is related to alterations in myocardial collagen characteristics. sixteen weeks of habitual exercise (ex) in rats, which produced left ventricular (lv) hypertrophy (lvh) [lv weight in g: ex=1.01 (0.04), sedentary control = 0.89 (0.04); p<0.05], resulted in a reduced lv end-diastolic (lved) chamber stiffness [slope of the linearised lved pressure versus lved internal diameter relation in kpa · mm−1: ex=0.67 (0.03), control=0.80 (0.03); p<0.05]. the increased lved chamber distensibility was associated with an attenuated myocardial stiffness [slope of the linearised lved stress versus strain relation in g · cm−2; ex=15 (3), control=25 (2); p<0.05]. although lv total collagen content (mg) was increased in the exercised rats [ex=5.0 (0.3), control=4.1 (0.2); p<0.05], this was a reflection of the presence of lvh, as the myocardial collagen concentration (μg · mg−1 lv wet weight) was unaltered [ex=4.9 (0.2), control=4.6 (0.2)]. furthermore, habitual exercise did not influence the percentage of myocardial collagen extracted following cyanogen bromide digestion (an index of collagen cross-linking), [i.e. ex=38 (3), control=38 (3)], nor the proportion of myocardial collagen phenotypes i and iii [i/iii; ex=3.04 (0.20), control=2.85 (0.22)]. in conclusion, exercise-induced increments in end-diastolic myocardial distensibility are unlikely to be a consequence of alterations in the properties of myocardial collagen.  left ventricular (lv) chamber and myocardial wall compliance were investigated in rats with exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy. voluntary exercise training was performed on running wheels. after 16 wk of exercise training, cardiac performance was measured in anesthetized open-chest ventilated rats. lv end-diastolic performance was calculated from both short-axis external diameter and long-axis segmental length measurements. exercise-trained rats developed significant lv hypertrophy (1.03 +/- 0.02 g) compared with control rats (0.91 +/- 0.03 g; p < 0.01). the physiological hypertrophy was associated with an increased lv wall thickness-to-internal radius ratio consistent with a concentric geometry. lv end-diastolic stiffness (slope of the linearized lv end-diastolic pressure-strain relationship) was decreased in both the short (p < 0.02) and long (p < 0.02) axis of lv as a result of exercise training. the lv end-diastolic chamber stiffness (slope of the linearized lv end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship) was also decreased in the exercised group (p < 0.05). the decreased chamber stiffness occurred as a consequence of a decrease in the regional myocardial wall elastic stiffness (slope of the linearized lv end-diastolic stress-strain relationship; p < 0.05). thus an increased lv wall thickness as a result of exercise-induced lv hypertrophy is associated with an enhanced ventricular chamber compliance, which in turn is attributed to a decrease in the diastolic stiffness of the myocardial wall.
in this study, the antioxidant effect of aminoguanidine on nephrotoxicity of a single dose of cisplatin is investigated and compared with the effects of well-known antioxidants vitamin c and e combination. tubular damage and perivascular inflammation were observed in kidney samples of the cisplatin-administered groups. aminoguanidine and vitamin c-e combination are found to be capable of preventing these effects of cisplatin. liver tissues of all groups were intact. cisplatin-induced oxidative stress was evidenced by significant decrease in glutathione and significant increase in malondialdehyde levels in kidney samples. antioxidants with cisplatin decreased malondialdehyde levels. antioxidants with cisplatin prevented the decrease in liver glutathione levels. the nephrotoxicity was confirmed biochemically by significant elevation of serum urea and creatinine levels. both vitamin c-e combination and aminoguanidine prevented the increase in serum urea levels according to the cisplatin group.  the effect of aminoguanidine (ag) on nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin (cddp) was investigated. a single dose of cddp (7.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced nephrotoxicity, manifested biochemically by a significant elevation in serum urea, creatinine and a severe decrease in serum albumin. moreover, marked increases in kidney weight, urine volume and urinary excretion of albumin were observed. nephrotoxicity was further confirmed by a significant decrease in glutathione-s-transferase (gst, e.c. 2.5.1.18), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px, e.c. 1.11.1.9) and catalase (e.c. 1.11.1.6) and a significant increase in lipid peroxides measured as malondialdhyde (mda) in kidney homogenates. administration of ag (100 mg/kg per day p.o.) in drinking water 5 days before and 5 days after cddp injection produced a significant protection against nephrotoxicity induced by cddp. the amelioration of nephrotoxicity was evidenced by significant reductions in serum urea and creatinine concentrations. in addition, ag tended to normalize decreased levels of serum albumin. urine volume, urinary excretions of albumin and gst and kidney weight were significantly decreased. moreover, ag prevented the rise of mda and the reduction of gst and gsh-px activities in the kidney. these results suggest that ag has a protective effect on nephrotoxicity induced by cddp and it may therefore improve the therapeutic index of cddp.

object tracking has remained a challenging problem in recent years. most of the trackers can not work well, especially when dealing with problems such as similarly colored backgrounds, object occlusions, low illumination, or sudden illumination changes in real scenes. a centroid iteration algorithm using multiple features and a posterior probability criterion is presented to solve these problems. the model representation of the object and the similarity measure are two key factors that greatly influence the performance of the tracker. firstly, this paper propose using a local texture feature which is a generalization of the local binary pattern (lbp) descriptor, which we call the double center-symmetric local binary pattern (dcs-lbp). this feature shows great discrimination between similar regions and high robustness to noise. by analyzing dcs-lbp patterns, a simplified dcs-lbp is used to improve the object texture model called the sdcs-lbp. the sdcs-lbp is able to describe the primitive structural information of the local image such as edges and corners. then, the sdcs-lbp and the color are combined to generate the multiple features as the target model. secondly, a posterior probability measure is introduced to reduce the rate of matching mistakes. three strategies of target model update are employed. experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is effective in improving tracking performance in complicated real scenarios compared with some state-of-the-art methods.  template matching is one of the principle techniques in visual tracking. various similarity measures have been developed to find the target in an acquired image by matching with a template. however, mismatching or misidentification may sporadically occur due to the influence of the background pixels included in the designated target model. taking into account the statistical features of a search region, a novel similarity measure is proposed, which can decrease the interference of the background pixels enclosed in the model. it highlights the significant target features and at the same time reduces the influence of the features shared by both the target and the background. it exhibits an excellent monotonic property and a distinct peak-like distribution. this new measure is also demonstrated to have a direct interpretation of posterior probability and is named as posterior probability measure (ppm). the proposed ppm can be obtained through a pixel-wise computation and exhibits suitability for image matching. the pixel-wise computation also enables a fast measure update after a target region has changed, which results in a new adaptive scaling method for tracking a target with a varying size. experiments show that it provides a higher precision in the localization and a discriminatory power superior to the existing similarity measures, such as bhattacharyya coefficient, kullback-leibler divergence, and normalized cross correlation. the effectiveness of the adaptive scaling method is demonstrated in experiments.
human papillomavirus (hpv) is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the us and the primary cause of cervical cancer. vietnamese american women have the highest incidence rates of cervical cancer but one of the lowest hpv vaccination rates. parental knowledge is an important predictor of hpv vaccination; however, little is known about hpv knowledge in the vietnamese american community. we aimed to describe the hpv knowledge of vietnamese mothers in houston, texas and their intention to vaccinate their daughters. we conducted face-to-face interviews with vietnamese mothers who had daughters aged 9–26 years. we collected data on demographics, acculturation, hpv knowledge, and vaccination intention. knowledge scores (0–5) were calculated using 5 knowledge questions. we used logistic regression to identify predictors of hpv knowledge. participants had low levels of acculturation by report of reading (31 %) and writing (23 %) english well. less than 50 % of participants (n = 47) had heard of hpv, and among these, the mean hpv knowledge score was 4. although only 1 in 3 had discussed hpv with their medical provider, nearly 86 % of participants who had not heard of hpv would vaccinate their daughter if their doctor had recommended it. good written english skills and belief that the hpv vaccine was not expensive were predictors of hpv awareness. hpv awareness is low among less acculturated vietnamese mothers in houston. future educational efforts about the role of hpv vaccine in preventing cervical cancer should be made in their language when targeting parents of a high risk vietnamese population.  purpose recent increases in incidence and survival of oropharyngeal cancers in the united states have been attributed to human papillomavirus (hpv) infection, but empirical evidence is lacking.   patients and methods hpv status was determined for all 271 oropharyngeal cancers (1984-2004) collected by the three population-based cancer registries in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) residual tissue repositories program by using polymerase chain reaction and genotyping (inno-lipa), hpv16 viral load, and hpv16 mrna expression. trends in hpv prevalence across four calendar periods were estimated by using logistic regression. observed hpv prevalence was reweighted to all oropharyngeal cancers within the cancer registries to account for nonrandom selection and to calculate incidence trends. survival of hpv-positive and hpv-negative patients was compared by using kaplan-meier and multivariable cox regression analyses.   results hpv prevalence in oropharyngeal cancers significantly increased over calendar time regardless of hpv detection assay (p trend < .05). for example, hpv prevalence by inno-lipa increased from 16.3% during 1984 to 1989 to 71.7% during 2000 to 2004. median survival was significantly longer for hpv-positive than for hpv-negative patients (131 v 20 months; log-rank p < .001; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% ci, 0.21 to 0.46). survival significantly increased across calendar periods for hpv-positive (p = .003) but not for hpv-negative patients (p = .18). population-level incidence of hpv-positive oropharyngeal cancers increased by 225% (95% ci, 208% to 242%) from 1988 to 2004 (from 0.8 per 100,000 to 2.6 per 100,000), and incidence for hpv-negative cancers declined by 50% (95% ci, 47% to 53%; from 2.0 per 100,000 to 1.0 per 100,000). if recent incidence trends continue, the annual number of hpv-positive oropharyngeal cancers is expected to surpass the annual number of cervical cancers by the year 2020.   conclusion increases in the population-level incidence and survival of oropharyngeal cancers in the united states since 1984 are caused by hpv infection.
cadmium (cd2+) induces renal proximal tubular (pt) damage, including disruption of the e-cadherin/β-catenin complex of adherens junctions (ajs) and apoptosis. yet, chronic cd2+ exposure causes malignant transformation of renal cells. previously, we have demonstrated that cd2+-mediated up-regulation of the multidrug transporter abcb1 causes apoptosis resistance in pt cells. we hypothesized that cd2+ activates adaptive signaling mechanisms mediated by β-catenin to evade apoptosis and increase proliferation. here we show that 50 µm cd2+, which induces cell death via apoptosis and necrosis, also causes a decrease of the trans-epithelial resistance of confluent wkpt-0293 cl.2 cells, a rat renal pt cell model, within 45 min of cd2+ exposure, as measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates cd2+-induced decrease of e-cadherin at ajs and redistribution of β-catenin from the e-cadherin/β-catenin complex of ajs to cytosol and nuclei after 3 h. immunoblotting confirms cd2+-induced decrease of e-cadherin expression and translocation of β-catenin to cytosol and nuclei of pt cells. rt-pcr shows cd2+-induced increase of expression of c-myc and of the isoform abcb1a at 3 h. the data prove for the first time that cd2+ induces nuclear translocation of β-catenin in pt cells. we speculate that cd2+ activates β-catenin/t-cell factor signaling to trans-activate proliferation and apoptosis resistance genes and promote carcinogenesis of pt cells.  cadherins and other cell–substrate and cell–cell adhesion molecules play an essential role during development. through their cytoplasmic interaction with the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion molecules physically link cells with the extracellular matrix and/or with each other. these interactions create architectural and structural entities that enable the tissues in the embryo to restrain the physical forces encountered during development. regulated cell adhesion is also often the driving force of morphogenetic movements. this review goes beyond the adhesive aspect of cadherins, focusing on their roles as signaling molecules in development. we discuss how cadherins, through their effects on cell proliferation, cell death, cell polarization, and differentiation, play a role in the formation of tissues and organs in the developing embryo. bioessays 21:211–220, 1999. © 1999 john wiley & sons, inc.
background there is emerging evidence that adjuvant treatments for breast cancer negatively impact cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) or vo2max, a key predictor of cardiovascular risk. although a number of studies have measured crf in breast cancer patients, there is currently limited data regarding expected crf values in this patient population. given that crf is a poor prognostic sign and recently highlighted as a key measure to standardize by the american heart association, we sought to review the available literature on crf among breast cancer patients. methods and results we identified 27 clinical trials and observational studies measuring vo2max in the pre– and post–adjuvant treatment setting for breast cancer. we compared vo2max before to vo2max after adjuvant therapy and compared vo2max in female breast cancer patients with vo2max in healthy controls. conclusions we found that crf was substantially lower in women with a history of breast cancer compared with healthy women and this was most pronounced among breast cancer patients in the post‐adjuvant setting. we conclude that knowledge of normative crf values is critical to tailor appropriately timed exercise interventions in breast cancer patients susceptible to low crf and subsequent cardiovascular risk.  doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity was used as a model to prospectively investigate neuroendocrine changes during the development of left ventricular dysfunction. radionuclide ventriculography, frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability (hrv), and plasma noradrenaline and natriuretic peptide measurements were performed in 27 adult lymphoma patients at baseline and after cumulative doxorubicin doses of 200, 400 and 500 mg/m(2). the left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) decreased from 58.1+/-1.4% to 50.3+/-1.1% (p<0.001) and 49.3+/-1.7% (p<0.001) after cumulative doxorubicin doses of 400 and 500 mg/m(2) respectively. with a doxorubicin dose of up to 400 mg/m(2) there was an increase in sympathetic tone, characterized by a decrease in the normalized high-frequency (hf(nu)) power (p=0.011), and increases in the normalized low-frequency (lf(nu)) power (p=0.011), the lf/hf ratio (p=0.021) and the plasma noradrenaline concentration (p=0.034). the decrease in lvef was correlated with the changes in lf(nu) and hf(nu) power (r=0.540, p=0.012) and lf/hf ratio (r=-0.452, p=0.04). however, after the cumulative doxorubicin dose of 500 mg/m(2) the changes in hrv components and plasma noradrenaline levels returned towards baseline. this was accompanied by increased concentrations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (p=0.004) and brain natriuretic peptide (p=0.021). our findings suggest that doxorubicin-induced left ventricular dysfunction is associated with an early change in sympathovagal balance towards sympathetic predominance. along with further progression of left ventricular dysfunction, there is an attenuation of sympathetic tone, which may be attributable to sympatho-adrenal inhibition by increased secretion of natriuretic peptides.
summary during antibody affinity maturation, germinal center (gc) b cells cycle between affinity‐driven selection in the light zone (lz) and proliferation and somatic hypermutation in the dark zone (dz). although selection of gc b cells is triggered by antigen‐dependent signals delivered in the lz, dz proliferation occurs in the absence of such signals. we show that positive selection triggered by t cell help activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1), which promotes the anabolic program that supports dz proliferation. blocking mtorc1 prior to growth prevented clonal expansion, whereas blockade after cells reached peak size had little to no effect. conversely, constitutively active mtorc1 led to dz enrichment but loss of competitiveness and impaired affinity maturation. thus, mtorc1 activation is required for fueling b cells prior to dz proliferation rather than for allowing cell‐cycle progression itself and must be regulated dynamically during cyclic re‐entry to ensure efficient affinity‐based selection. graphical abstract figure. no caption available. highlightspositive selection of gc b cells triggers mtorc1 activation prior to clonal expansionmtorc1 is required for biomass accumulation but dispensable for cell‐cycle progressionderegulated mtorc1 promotes dz phenotype and leads to loss of gc competitivenessrapamycin‐resistant mouse strain is used for cell‐intrinsic mtorc1 inhibition &na; during germinal center selection, signals from tfh cells in the light zone dictate the extent of b cell proliferation in the dark zone. ersching et al. (2017) show that tfh help induces mtorc1 activation in light zone b cells, leading to cell growth that sustains the subsequent dark zone proliferative burst.  b cells have a need for speed high-affinity antibodies provide long-lasting protective immunity against many infections. generating such antibodies requires help, in the form of t cells, which interact with antibody-producing b cells. as b cells proliferate and mutate their antibody genes, t cells select the cells producing high-affinity antibodies. gitlin et al. show in mice that b cells that receive t cell help transit through the cell cycle more quickly by increasing the speed at which replication forks progress. such a rapid cell cycle transition gives high-affinity b cells a selective advantage. science, this issue p. 643 t cells help select high-affinity antibodies by increasing the speed at which b cells progress through the cell cycle. the germinal center (gc) is a microanatomical compartment wherein high-affinity antibody-producing b cells are selectively expanded. b cells proliferate and mutate their antibody genes in the dark zone (dz) of the gc and are then selected by t cells in the light zone (lz) on the basis of affinity. here, we show that t cell help regulates the speed of cell cycle phase transitions and dna replication of gc b cells. genome sequencing and single-molecule analyses revealed that t cell help shortens s phase by regulating replication fork progression, while preserving the relative order of replication origin activation. thus, high-affinity gc b cells are selected by a mechanism that involves prolonged dwell time in the dz where selected cells undergo accelerated cell cycles.
chronic periodontitis (cp) is an inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues of the teeth caused by specific microorganism. hypertension is one of the major causes of cardiovascular disease whereas periodontitis has recently drawn increasing attention because of its potential relationship with cardiovascular disease. the objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of the hypertension in cp patients as well as to evaluate the association between hypertension and severity of cp. one hundred and eighty five records of cp patients treated in dental clinic, universiti sains malaysia hospital (usm hospital), kelantan from 2010 until 2013 were retrieved and reviewed. the diagnosis of periodontal disease and the presence of hypertension were recorded. the severity of chronic periodontitis was classified into mild, moderate and severe according to the clinical attachment loss. the data was obtained and analyzed using spss version 20.0. majority of the subjects were from malay ethnic group (94.4%) at the age range between 41 and 61 years (67.8%). in conclusion, the prevalence of hypertension in chronic periodontitis patients was 12.2%. there was no significant association between hypertension and severity of cp (p=0.229).  chronic periodontitis is a common inflammatory disorder that is being contemplated as a risk factor for atherosclerotic complications. current epidemiological evidence also supports its potential association with increases in blood pressure levels and hypertension prevalence. furthermore, data from cross-sectional studies suggest that in hypertensive subjects periodontitis may enhance the risk and degree of target organ damage. a possible pathogenetic background of an effect of periodontitis on blood pressure should include the systemic generalization of the local oral inflammation, the role of the host immune response, the direct microbial effect on the vascular system and alterations in endothelial function. inversely, the concept of hypertension unfavorably affecting periodontal tissues cannot be excluded. the two conditions share multiple common risk factors that should be readily controlled for when assessing a possible association. thoroughly designed prospective and interventional trials are needed in order to determine the impact of periodontitis on blood pressure regulation and incident hypertension and its integration in the clinical approach of both dental and hypertensive patients.
&na; the yolk sac and small intestine are 2 important organs responsible for the digestion and absorption of nutrients in chickens during the embryonic and posthatch periods, respectively. the peptide transporter pept1 is expressed in both the yolk sac and small intestine and plays an important role in the transport of amino acids as short peptides. the objective of this study was to profile the spatial transcriptional patterns of pept1 mrna in the yolk sac and small intestine from embryonic and posthatch broilers. the distribution of pept1 mrna was investigated by in situ hybridization at embryonic (e) d 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 and day of hatch (doh) in the yolk sac and at e19, doh, and d 1, d 4, and d 7 posthatch in the small intestine. pept1 mrna was expressed in the endodermal cells of the yolk sac. pept1 mrna was barely detectable at e11, increased from e11 to e13, e15, and e17, and then gradually decreased from e19 to doh. in the small intestine, there was a rapid increase in expression of pept1 mrna in the enterocytes from e19 to doh, with expression relatively constant from d 1 to d 7. in addition, there was a differential increase in the heights of the villi in different parts of the small intestine from d 1 to 7, which may partially explain the temporal increase in pept1 mrna detected by qpcr. the villi in the duodenum showed the earliest increase in villus height and ultimately resulted in the highest villi at d 7. these results demonstrate that there are temporal changes in pept1 mrna expression in the yolk sac and the small intestine, which correspond with their expected role in nutrient uptake during the embryonic and posthatch periods.  chick embryos derive nutrients from the yolk during incubation and transition to intestinal absorption of nutrients posthatch. the uptake of nutrients is mediated by a variety of membrane-bound transporter proteins. the objective of this study was to determine the expression profiles of nutrient transporters and digestive enzymes during incubation in the yolk sac membrane (ysm) and embryonic intestine of egg-laying (leghorn) and meat-producing (cobb) chickens derived from 22 to 30 wk (young) and 45 to 50 wk (old) breeder flocks. transporters examined included the peptide transporter pept1, the glutamate/aspartate (eaat3), cationic (cat-1) and neutral (b0at) amino acid transporters, and the fructose (glut5) and glucose (sglt1) transporters. digestive enzymes included aminopeptidase n (apn) and sucrase-isomaltase (si). expression of these genes was assessed by real-time pcr using the absolute quantification method in ysm at embryonic day (e) 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, and 21 and intestine at e15, 17, 19, 20, and 21. the pept1 and apn gene expression in the ysm increased until e15 and then decreased until e21, whereas expression in the intestine increased from e15 to e21. the b0at showed a similar pattern, with greatest expression in the ysm occurring at e17/e19. the cat1 and glut5 genes showed decreased expression in the ysm and increased expression in the intestine until e17/e19 and then a decrease until e21. expression of sglt1 and eaat3 showed increased gene expression over time in both the intestine and ysm. expression of si showed little to no gene expression in the ysm, whereas the intestine exhibited consistently high levels of gene expression. in ysm and intestine, si expression was greater in leghorn than cobb, whereas cat1 and glut5 expression was greater in cobb than leghorn. expression of the apn, cat1, and si genes was greater in embryos from young flocks than old flocks in ysm and intestine. these results demonstrate that the ysm expresses many of the digestive enzymes and nutrient transporters typically associated with the intestine and that these genes show tissue- and development-specific patterns of expression.
in this study, we introduce a new peer-to-peer (p2p) approach to instant messaging systems based on a fully decentralized network, and where each human owning a peer can control the traffic supported by her system. the control may be based on criteria such as: (a) her desire to help the endpoints of the communication, e.g., based on friendship, (b) her desire to help a cause, e.g., based on the content/topic of the communication, (c) reputation, or (d) the utility brought to her by the handled data. peers need help to communicate when they are behind nats. unlike the p2p chat system used in skype, no centralized servers are involved (no central redirect server, login server or web server). providing intrinsic motivation such that peers help with traffic is important in order to eventually make an open source p2p chat system viable. in current non-incentive p2p systems like skype, availability of open source versions can potentially starve the system of supernodes (since users can disable the resource consuming supernode-function). in our approach, each peer has equal privileges to any other peer. nodes register their address with other peers of their choice, which can then act as directories on their behalf. each peer with sufficient resources can voluntarily play the role of directory for her friends or of forwarding incoming messages to peers behind nats. this paper analyzes key functions of the solution such as incentive management, nat and firewall traversal, connection establishment and message transfer under different network setups.  the rapid growth of decentralized and unstructured peer-topeer (p2p) networks [3, 7] points to a new efficient paradigm for information exchange on the internet. a p2p network may exhibit a power-law topology [5] such that it can propagate queries quickly and, if implemented efficiently [7], it can locate objects in time, where is the number of nodes in the network. however, there are remaining problems with the p2p paradigm which complicates its deployment. freeriding and tragedy of the commons are two major problems. as shown in [1], nearly 70% of gnutella users do not share any file with the p2p community and nearly 50% of all search responses come from the top 1% of content sharing nodes. therefore, nodes that share resources are always congested and the tragedy of the commons [2] occurs. another problem is that many users misreport their connection types so as to discourage others from going to their sites for file download. worse yet, there is no service differentiation between users who do not share any information and users who contribute significantly to the p2p community. the objective of this paper is to design a mechanism that provides incentives for users to share information and offers preferential service to users who contribute to the p2p community. in particular, we address the following questions:
myoendothelial gap junctional signaling mediates pulmonary arterial endothelial cell (paec)-induced activation of latent tgf-β and differentiation of cocultured pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (pasmcs), but the nature of the signal passing from paecs to pasmcs through the gap junctions is unknown. because paecs but not pasmcs synthesize serotonin, and serotonin can pass through gap junctions, we hypothesized that the monoamine is the intercellular signal. we aimed to determine whether paec-derived serotonin mediates paec-induced myoendothelial gap junction-dependent activation of tgf-β signaling and differentiation of pasmcs. rat paecs and pasmcs were monocultured or cocultured with (touch) or without (no-touch) direct cell-cell contact. in all cases, tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (tph1) transcripts were expressed predominantly in paecs. serotonin was detected by immunostaining in both paecs and pasmcs in paec/pasmc touch coculture but was not found in pasmcs in either paec/pasmc no-touch coculture or in pasmc/pasmc touch coculture. furthermore, inhibition of gap junctions but not of the serotonin transporter in paec/pasmc touch coculture prevented serotonin transfer from paecs to pasmcs. inhibition of serotonin synthesis pharmacologically or by small interfering rnas to tph1 in paecs inhibited the paec-induced activation of tgf-β signaling and differentiation of pasmcs. we concluded that serotonin synthesized by paecs is transferred through myoendothelial gap junctions into pasmcs, where it activates tgf-β signaling and induces a more differentiated phenotype. this finding suggests a novel role of gap junction-mediated intercellular serotonin signaling in regulation of pasmc phenotype.  myoendothelial gap junctions are involved in regulating systemic arterial smooth muscle cell phenotype and function, but their role in the regulation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (pasmc) phenotype is unknown. we therefore investigated in cocultured pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (paecs) and pasmcs whether myoendothelial gap junctional signaling played a role in paec-dependent regulation of pasmc phenotype. rat paecs and pasmcs were cocultured on opposite sides of a porous transwell membrane that permitted formation of heterotypic cell-cell contacts. immunostaining showed expression of the gap junctional protein connexin 43 (cx43) on projections extending into the membrane from both cell types. dye transfer exhibited functional gap junctional communication from paecs to pasmcs. pasmcs cocultured with paecs had a more contractile-like phenotype (spindle shape and increased expression of the contractile proteins myosin heavy chain, h1-calponin, and α-smooth muscle cell-actin) than pasmcs cocultured with pasmcs or cocultured without direct contact with paecs. transforming growth factor (tgf)-β1 signaling was activated in pasmcs cocultured with paecs, and the pasmc differentiation was inhibited by tgf-β type i receptor blockade. inhibition of gap junctional communication pharmacologically or by knock down of cx43 in paecs blocked tgf-β signaling and pasmc differentiation. these results implicate myoendothelial gap junctions as a gateway for paec-derived signals required for maintaining tgf-β-dependent pasmc differentiation. this study identifies an alternative pathway to paracrine signaling to convey regulatory signals from paecs to pasmcs and raises the possibility that dysregulation of this direct interaction is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertensive pulmonary vascular remodeling.
in this paper, we propose a novel approach based on a single convolutional neural network (cnn) for age estimation. in our proposed network architecture, we first model the randomness of aging with the gaussian distribution which is used to calculate the gaussian integral of an age interval. then, we present a soft softmax regression function used in the network. the new function applies the aging modeling to compute the function loss. compared with the traditional softmax function, the new function considers not only the chronological age but also the interval nearby true age. moreover, owing to the complex of gaussian integral in soft softmax function, a look up table is built to accelerate this process. all the integrals of age values are calculated offline in advance. we evaluate our method on two public datasets: morph ii and cross-age celebrity dataset (cacd), and experimental results have shown that the proposed method has gained superior performances compared to the state of the art.  !, model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. it is more problematic to apply modelbased methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. the problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. we argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. we describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. these models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by active contour models (snakes). the key difference is that our active shape models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. we show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images. q 199s a&& prrss, in.
it has been proposed that barnacle cyprids can maintain position in shoreward- propagating fronts by swimming upward against a downwelling flow, potentially mediating onshore transport of larvae toward intertidal habitat. this study developed a novel flume to characterize swimming behavior of barnacle cyprids in a laboratory downwelling flow. seawater was pumped through a cylindrical observation chamber fitted with diffusers to produce a homogeneous down- welling velocity field. the flume generated plug flow with mean downwelling velocities (indicated by negative sign) of 0 to -47.3 mm s -1 . behavior experiments were done with wild semibalanus bal- anoides cyprids. vertical swimming rates and behaviors were estimated from video observations, and a mixture model was used to estimate velocity distributions for distinct behavioral modes. larvae exhibited multiple behaviors but typically swam upward in response to downwelling, with a maxi- mum estimated vertical velocity of 72.3 mm s -1 . when faced with downwelling flows, cyprids alter- nated between upward swimming and downward swimming to maintain their vertical position in the chamber. as downwelling velocities increased, cyprids that remained in the field of view of the cam- eras exhibited faster mean upward swimming velocities. it is unclear how long individual s. bal- anoides cyprids can maintain depth, but cyprids were able to maintain depth throughout the 2 min observation period. this study supports earlier hypotheses based on field observations by demon- strating that s. balanoides cyprids swim well enough to counter downwelling velocities characteris- tic of convergence zones. swimming against downwelling flow could be an adaptive behavior that enables shoreward transport in the absence of any larval ability to swim toward shore or even to sense its direction.  field observations imply that accumulation and advection of invertebrate larvae and other plankton by propagating fronts provides an efficient mechanism for the cross-shelf transport and subsequent coastal settlement of larvae and plankton. gravity currents propagating into a heavier, uniform-density fluid are known to have near-surface velocities u that exceed the propagation speed c of the gravity current nose. it is shown by simple dam-break laboratory experiments and through corresponding numerical solutions of two-dimensional stratified flow and lagrangian particle advection that this characteristic of gravity currents can lead to accumulation in the gravity current nose of particles that originate well behind the gravity current head. however, efficient particle accumulation and transport with the speed c only occurs for particles with sufficient vertical buoyancy or vertical swimming capability. weakly buoyant or neutral particles are swept down and back away from the gravity current head by the circulation in this region. a dam break into an ambient fluid with stratification (two-layered) could result in the transport of some particles that are initially trapped in the forepart of the leading disturbance, an undular bore. however, this situation does not result in significant accumulation of particles at the leading edge of the disturbance. the numerical solutions show that particles that originate in the dense fluid ahead of the gravity current are much less likely to be accumulated at the gravity current nose. a simple scaling criterion for the minimum vertical buoyancy velocity for efficient accumulation and transport of buoyant particles based on the gravity current and particle characteristics is developed and compares favorably with the numerical results. the implications of these results for transport of larvae in coastal environments are discussed. the dynamics of marine benthic invertebrate populations are greatly affected by larval transport. for near-shore populations, larval transport prior to settlement includes at least three processes: cross-shore advection, because larvae are generally very small and cannot control their cross-shore position by swimming alone; larval behavior, because by swimming vertically, larvae might be able to exploit some depth-dependent cross-shore flows; and accumulation by convergent circulation in propagating features, because cross-shore advection of larvae is often dependent on the retention of larvae at the propagating features. several hypotheses of onshore larval transport, namely surface slicks over linear internal waves (shanks 1983), internal bore warm fronts (pineda 1994), and upwelling relaxation fronts (farrell et al. 1991), invoke concentration of larvae at propagating features. these hypotheses state that larvae become concentrated at convergent features aligned parallel to the coastline and that larval transport occurs as these linear features propagate shoreward. the interplay between transport and accumulation is poorly understood; issues include (1) the dependency of transport on accumulation, and of accumulation on larval behavior, and (2) whether the frontal larvae originate onshore or off
abstract african easterly waves (aews) are identified in numerical model analyses using an objective technique based on the 700-hpa streamfunction field. this method has been developed to (i) reduce the amount of manual data interpretation, (ii) reduce the likelihood of unrelated phenomena being identified as aews, and (iii) facilitate completely objective comparisons between aews with different structures on multiple scales, in order to describe their variability. results show this method performs well when compared to methods of aew identification used in previous studies. the objective technique is used to analyze all aews that originated over tropical north africa during july–september (jas) 2004. results indicate that the “average” aew in this period bears a close resemblance to composite structures from previous research. however, there is marked variability in the characteristics and ultimate fate of aews. most aews of jas 2004 are first identified east of the greenwich meridian and develop as they...  abstract the existence of african easterly waves (aews) north of the african easterly jet (aej) core with maximum amplitude at low levels has been confirmed and clarified using radiosonde data and the u.k. meteorological office global model analysis from the hurricane season of 1995. at bamako (12.5°n, 8.0°w) the aews were characterized mainly by maximum amplitudes at the level of the aej (around 700 mb), whereas at dakar (14.7°n, 17.5°w) the waves were characterized by maxima between 850 and 950 mb. the low-level waves to the north of the aej arise in association with baroclinic interactions between the negative meridional potential vorticity (pv) gradients in the jet core and the positive low-level gradient of potential temperature, θ, enhanced by the presence of low-static-stability air north of the aej. these waves follow the positive meridional θ gradients over northern africa in contrast to the jet-level aews that follow the meridional pv gradients at the level of the aej. cross-correlation analysis...
this study investigated performance on the delis–kaplan executive function system (d-kefs) tower test in a sample of 12 patients with focal lesions in the lateral prefrontal cortex (pfc) and 12 control participants. pfc patients performed worse overall, spent more time on each move, and committed significantly more rule violations. the rule violation measure demonstrated 83% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the detection of lesions. findings highlight the importance of error monitoring in the assessment of executive functioning. these preliminary results suggest that the lateral pfc may be critical for self-monitoring/inhibition and speed of processing in planning tasks.  problem-solving ability was investigated in 25 dsm-iiir schizophrenic (sc) patients using the tower of hanoi (toh) task. their performance was compared to that of: (1) 22 patients with neurosurgical unilateral prefrontal lesions, 11 left (lf) and 10 right hemisphere (rf); (2) 38 patients with unilateral temporal lobectomies, 19 left (lt) and 19 right (rt); and (3) 44 matched control subjects. like the rt and lf group, the schizophrenics were significantly impaired on the toh. the deficit shown by the schizophrenic group was equivalent whether or not the problems to be solved included goal-subgoal conflicts, unlike the lf group who were impaired specifically on these problems. the nature of the sc deficit was also distinct from that of the rt group, in that the problem-solving deficit remained after controlling for the effects of spatial memory performance. this study indicates, therefore, that neither focal frontal nor temporal lobe damage sustained in adult life is a sufficient explanation for the problem-solving deficits found in patients with schizophrenia.
test sets play an essential role in evaluating text entry techniques. in this paper, we argue that in addition to the widely adopted metric of bigram representativeness and memorability, word clarity should also be considered as a metric when creating test sets from the target dataset. word clarity quantifies the extent to which a word is likely to confuse with other words on a keyboard. we formally define word clarity, derive equations calculating it, and both theoretically and empirically show that word clarity has a significant effect on text entry performance: it can yield up to 26.4% difference in error rate, and 25% difference in input speed. we later propose a pareto optimization method for sampling test sets with different sizes, which optimizes the word clarity and bigram representativeness, and memorability of the test set. the obtained test sets are published on the internet.  in text entry experiments, memorability is a desired property of the phrases used as stimuli. unfortunately, to date there is no automated method to achieve this effect. as a result, researchers have to use either manually curated english-only phrase sets or sampling procedures that do not guarantee phrases being memorable. in response to this need, we present a novel sampling method based on two core ideas: a multiple regression model over language-independent features, and the statistical analysis of the corpus from which phrases will be drawn. our results show that researchers can finally use a method to successfully curate their own stimuli targeting potentially any language or domain. the source code as well as our phrase sets are publicly available.
backgroundpatients in intensive care units receive many drugs simultaneously but through limited venous accesses. several intravenous therapies have to be administered through the same catheter, thus increasing the risk of physicochemical incompatibility. the purpose of this work was to assess and to quantify the impact of physical incompatibility on the mass flow rates of drugs infused simultaneously to the patient, through an in vitro study.methodsfurosemide-midazolam incompatibility was used to assess the impact of physical incompatibility on drug mass flow rates. furosemide, midazolam, and saline were simultaneously infused. a filter was added at the end of the infusion line to retain visible particles. two infusion conditions were tested with and without visible particles. a partial least square method on uv spectra was used to determine simultaneously the concentrations of the two drugs at the egress of the terminal extension line. the drug mass flow rate (expressed as mg/h) was calculated as the product of drug concentration versus total flow rate. observed/theoretical mass flow rate ratios for each drug (%) were determined per infusion condition.resultseven in the absence of visible particles, precipitation of furosemide led to a drug loss estimated at between 10% and 15%. furosemide is more impacted by interaction because the ph of the mixture is acid and this form is poorly soluble in an aqueous solution.conclusionsphysical incompatibility between furosemide and midazolam leads to a significant reduction in drug delivered to the patient and may result in treatment failure.  background: multiaccess infusion sets allow multiple simultaneous infusions but may induce interference in drug delivery resulting from large variations in the delivery rate of potent drugs. in this study, we sought to understand the influence of multiaccess infusion device properties (dead space volume and antireflux valve [arv]) on drug delivery during multi-infusion therapy. methods: infusion sets differing in length, dead space volume, and presence of an arv were assessed. three drugs were infused simultaneously through different access points, and their concentrations were obtained using uv spectrophotometric analysis of the effluent. different infusion configurations were compared by assessing (1) the amount of drug delivered to the patient per unit of time, (2) the mean amount of drug delivered to the patient per unit of time during the steady-state infusion (mass flow rate plateau), and (3) flow change efficiency calculated from the ratio of the area under the experimental instant mass flow rate curve to the area corresponding to theoretical instant mass flow rate curve. results: infusion sets with lower dead space volumes offered significantly higher flow change efficiency (53.0% ± 15.4% with a dead space volume equal to 0.046 ml 5 min after the start of infusion) than infusion sets with higher dead space volume (5.6% ± 8.2% with a dead space volume equal to 6.16 ml), whatever the flow rate changes. even in case of large dead space volumes, the presence of an arv significantly increased the mass flow rate plateau (from 92.4% to 99.3% of the theoretical plateau without and with the presence of an arv, respectively). conclusions: multi-infusion therapy induces perturbation in drug delivery. these perturbations (lag time, backflow, and bolus) could be reduced by using infusion sets including very low dead space volume and an arv.
training counselors in empirically supported treatments (ests) far exceeds the ever decreasing resources of community-based treatment agencies. the purpose of this study was to examine outpatient substance abuse group counselors' (n=19) adherence and competence in communicating and utilizing concepts associated with empirically-supported relapse prevention treatment following a brief multimedia toolkit (roadmap toolkit™) training. moderate or large baseline to post-training effect sizes for counselor adherence to toolkit content were identified for 13 of 21 targeted behaviors (overall d range=.06-2.85) with the largest gains on items measuring active skill practice. post-training adherence gains were largely maintained at the 6-month follow-up, although no statistically significant improvements were identified over time for counselor competence. this study provides important preliminary support for using a multi-media curriculum approach to increase empirically-supported relapse prevention skills among group counselors. future research should focus on finding ways to improve counselor skill level and to determine the impact of the toolkit on client outcomes.  we evaluated a 2-day training workshop on motivational interviewing (mi) for addiction and mental health clinicians (n = 22). clinicians completed the helpful responses questionnaire (hrq) and taped interactions with a standardized patient (sp). independent, blinded coders rated the tapes using the motivational interviewing skills code (misc). post-training assessment showed significant increase on the hrq and two of four misc summary scores for sp interviews. at 2-month follow-up, means of the hrq and two misc summary scores remained higher than baseline, but declined from post-training. some mi skills improved to a greater degree than others, and a subset of clinicians (> 40%) showed continued improvement at follow-up. results were consistent across interviews with different sps, supporting the use of this assessment method. findings highlight the need for additional research on the use of standardized patients, alternative assessment techniques, and effective methods of technology transfer for mi skill acquisition and retention.
cug-bp, elav-like family member 1 (celf1) is a highly conserved rna binding protein that regulates pre-mrna alternative splicing, polyadenylation, mrna stability, and translation. in the heart, celf1 is expressed in the myocardium, where its levels are tightly regulated during development. celf1 levels peak in the heart during embryogenesis, and aberrant up-regulation of celf1 in the adult heart has been implicated in cardiac pathogenesis in myotonic dystrophy type 1, as well as in diabetic cardiomyopathy. either inhibition of celf activity or over-expression of celf1 in heart muscle causes cardiomyopathy in transgenic mice. nonetheless, many of the cardiac targets of celf1 regulation remain unknown. in this study, to identify cardiac targets of celf1 we performed cross-linking immunoprecipitation (clip) for celf1 from embryonic day 8 chicken hearts. we identified a previously unannotated exon in myh7b as a novel target of celf1-mediated regulation. we demonstrated that knockdown of celf1 in primary chicken embryonic cardiomyocytes leads to increased inclusion of this exon and decreased myh7b levels. we also investigated global changes in the transcriptome of primary embryonic cardiomyocytes following celf1 knockdown in a published rna-seq dataset. pathway and network analyses identified strong associations between celf1 and regulation of cell cycle and translation. important regulatory proteins, including both rna binding proteins and a cardiac transcription factor, were affected by loss of celf1. together, these data suggest that celf1 is a key regulator of cardiomyocyte gene expression.  microsatellite expansions cause a number of dominantly-inherited neurological diseases. expansions in coding-regions cause protein gain-of-function effects, while non-coding expansions produce toxic rnas that alter rna splicing activities of mbnl and celf proteins. bi-directional expression of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (sca8) ctg cag expansion produces cug expansion rnas (cugexp) from the atxn8os gene and a nearly pure polyglutamine expansion protein encoded by atxn8 cagexp transcripts expressed in the opposite direction. here, we present three lines of evidence that rna gain-of-function plays a significant role in sca8: 1) cugexp transcripts accumulate as ribonuclear inclusions that co-localize with mbnl1 in selected neurons in the brain; 2) loss of mbnl1 enhances motor deficits in sca8 mice; 3) sca8 cugexp transcripts trigger splicing changes and increased expression of the cugbp1-mbnl1 regulated cns target, gaba-a transporter 4 (gat4/gabt4). in vivo optical imaging studies in sca8 mice confirm that gabt4 upregulation is associated with the predicted loss of gabaergic inhibition within the granular cell layer. these data demonstrate that cugexp transcripts dysregulate mbnl/celf regulated pathways in the brain and provide mechanistic insight into the cns effects of other cugexp disorders. moreover, our demonstration that relatively short cugexp transcripts cause rna gain-of-function effects and the growing number of antisense transcripts recently reported in mammalian genomes suggest unrecognized toxic rnas contribute to the pathophysiology of polyglutamine cag ctg disorders.
the hsp90 chaperone is essential in eukaryotes and activates a large array of client proteins. in contrast, its role is still elusive in bacteria, and only a few hsp90 bacterial clients are known. here, we found that hsp90 is essential in the model bacterium shewanella oneidensis under heat stress. a genetic screen for hsp90 client proteins identified tils, an essential protein involved in trna maturation. overexpression of tils rescued the growth defect of the hsp90 deletion strain under heat stress. in vivo, the activity and the amount of tils were significantly reduced in the absence of hsp90 at high temperature. furthermore, we showed that hsp90 interacts with tils, and hsp90 prevents tils aggregation in vitro at high temperature. together, our results indicate that tils is a client of hsp90 in s. oneidensis. therefore, our study links the essentiality of bacterial hsp90 at high temperature with the identification of a client.  salmonellaenterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium (salmonella typhimurium) contamination of pork, is one of the major sources of human salmonellosis. the bacterium is able to persist and hide in asymptomatic carrier animals, generating a reservoir for salmonella transmission to other animals and humans. mechanisms involved in salmonella persistence in pigs remain poorly understood. in the present study, we demonstrate that the salmonellahtpg gene, encoding a homologue of the eukaryotic heat shock protein 90, contributes to salmonella typhimurium persistence in intestine-associated tissues of pigs, but not in the tonsils. htpg does not seem to play an important role during the acute phase of infection. the contribution to persistence was shown to be associated with htpg-dependent salmonella invasion and survival in porcine enterocytes and macrophages. these results reveal the role of htpg as a virulence factor contributing to salmonella persistence in pigs.
purposea subset of patients treated for lyme disease report persistent or recurrent symptoms of unknown etiology named post-treatment lyme disease syndrome (ptlds). this study aims to describe a cohort of participants with early, untreated lyme disease, and characterize post-treatment symptomatology and functional impact of ptlds over time.methodssixty-three participants with erythema migrans and systemic symptoms were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. participants underwent physical exams and clinical assessments, and completed the sf-36 (daily life functioning) and the beck depression inventory, second edition (bdi-ii) (depression), at each of five visits over a period of 6 months.resultssigns of lyme disease disappeared post-treatment; however, new-onset patient-reported symptoms increased or plateaued over time. at 6 months, 36% of patients reported new-onset fatigue, 20% widespread pain, and 45% neurocognitive difficulties. however, less than 10% reported greater than “minimal” depression across the entire period. those with ptlds (36%) did not differ significantly from those without with respect to demographics, pre-treatment sf-36, and bdi-ii scores. statistically significant differences were found over time on the role physical, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health subscales (with a trend toward significance for the remaining three subscales of physical functioning, bodily pain, and general health) of the sf-36 between those with an eventual ptlds diagnosis and those without when measured at 6 months.conclusionsunlike clinical signs of lyme disease, new-onset symptoms are reported by a subset of participants without evidence of depressive symptomatology. patients who developed ptlds had significantly lower life functioning compared to those without ptlds. we propose future avenues for researching infection-triggered symptoms resulting from multiple mechanisms.  evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis were prepared by an expert panel of the infectious diseases society of america. these updated guidelines replace the previous treatment guidelines published in 2000 (clin infect dis 2000; 31[suppl 1]:1-14). the guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for patients who either have these infections or may be at risk for them. for each of these ixodes tickborne infections, information is provided about prevention, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment. tables list the doses and durations of antimicrobial therapy recommended for treatment and prevention of lyme disease and provide a partial list of therapies to be avoided. a definition of post-lyme disease syndrome is proposed.
absorption of monoclonal antibodies (mabs) after s.c. injection results from the interplay among several kinetic processes. the aims of this study were to investigate the absorption mechanisms of rituximab in rats by using slow s.c. infusion and coadministration with nonspecific igg or hyaluronidase, and to evaluate the predictive performance of the pharmacokinetic model previously developed to describe the nonlinear absorption behavior of mabs. rituximab serum concentrations were measured after s.c. coadministration with nonspecific igg and hyaluronidase to rats. several dose levels and different injection sites were evaluated. for the back site, 6.5- and 2.6-fold decreases in the area under the concentration-time curve were obtained after coadministration with igg for 1 and 10 mg/kg doses compared with administration of rituximab alone. for the abdomen, only a minor reduction in concentrations was observed. hyaluronidase increased the rate of s.c. absorption and the bioavailability (1.9- and 1.6-fold for the back and the abdomen injection of 10 mg/kg). our previously established pharmacokinetic model provided excellent predictions of the effect of nonspecific igg on rituximab absorption. in conclusion, the magnitude of the effect of absorption modifiers is dependent on the site of injection and the dose level of rituximab. pharmacokinetic profiles further support the hypothesis that neonatal fc receptor–mediated transport is a major determinant of s.c. absorption of mabs.  the neonatal fc receptor (fcrn) plays an important and well-known role in immunoglobulin g (igg) catabolism; however, its role in the disposition of igg after subcutaneous (sc) administration, including bioavailability, is relatively unknown. to examine the potential effect of fcrn on igg sc bioavailability, we engineered three anti-amyloid β monoclonal antibody (mab) reverse chimeric mouse igg2a (migg2a) fc variants (i253a.h435a, n434h and n434y) with different binding affinities to mouse fcrn (mfcrn) and compared their sc bioavailability to that of the wild-type (wt) mab in mice. our results indicated that the sc bioavailability of migg2a was affected by mfcrn-binding affinity. variant i253a.h435a, which did not bind to mfcrn at either ph 6.0 or ph 7.4, had the lowest bioavailability (41.8%). variant n434y, which had the greatest increase in binding affinity at both ph 6.0 and ph 7.4, had comparable bioavailability to the wt antibody (86.1% vs. 76.3%), whereas variant n434h, which had modestly increased binding affinity at ph 6.0 to mfcrn and affinity comparable to the wt antibody at ph 7.4, had the highest bioavailability (94.7%). a semi-mechanism-based pharmacokinetic model, which described well the observed data with the wt antibody and variant i253a.h435a, is consistent with the hypothesis that the decreased bioavailability of variant i253a.h435a was due to loss of the fcrn-mediated protection from catabolism at the absorption site. together, these data demonstrate that fcrn plays an important role in sc bioavailability of therapeutic igg antibodies.
it has been postulated that the development of amyloid plaques in alzheimer's disease (ad) may result from an imbalance between the generation and clearance of the amyloid-β peptide (aβ). although familial ad appears to be caused by aβ overproduction, sporadic ad (the most prevalent form) may result from impairment in clearance. recent evidence suggests that several proteases may contribute to the degradation of aβ. furthermore, astrocytes have recently been implicated as a potential cellular mediator of aβ degradation. in this study, we examined the possibility that matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), proteases known to be expressed and secreted by astrocytes, could play a role in extracellular aβ degradation. we found that astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques showed enhanced expression of mmp-2 and mmp-9 in aged amyloid precursor protein (app)/presenilin 1 mice. moreover, astrocyte-conditioned medium (acm) degraded aβ, lowering levels and producing several fragments after incubation with synthetic human aβ1–40 and aβ1–42. this activity was attenuated with specific inhibitors of mmp-2 and -9, as well as in acm derived from mmp-2 or -9 knock-out (ko) mice. in vivo, significant increases in the steady-state levels of aβ were found in the brains of mmp-2 and -9 ko mice compared with wild-type controls. furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the mmps with n-[(2r)-2-(hydroxamidocarbonylmethyl)-4-methylpentanoyl]-l-tryptophan methylamide (gm 6001) increased brain interstitial fluid aβ levels and elimination of half-life in appsw mice. these results suggest that mmp-2 and -9 may contribute to extracellular brain aβ clearance by promoting aβ catabolism.  activated macrophages produce several matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), a family of extracellular matrix (ecm)‐degrading enzymes, during wound healing and in other inflammatory states. in response to brain injury, brain microglia become “activated,” in a way similar to peripheral tissue macrophages, a process which includes differentiation and probably invasion and proliferation. little is known about the ecm‐degrading mmps that are secreted by microglia upon activation. thus, it was of interest to determine whether activated microglia secrete mmps. conditioned media samples obtained from cultured microglia that were stimulated with various activating agents were subjected to gelatin‐substrate zymography. microglia constitutively express low levels of a 94‐kda gelatinase (glase) activity. treatment with lps, zymosan, and fixed staphylococcus aureus for 24 hr stimulated the activity of the 94‐kda glase, 4‐20‐fold, in a dose‐dependent manner. addition of infγ inhibited the lps‐stimulated activity of mmp‐9. lps, zymosan, and fixed staphylococcus aureus also stimulated the secretion of il‐6 from microglia in a dose‐dependent manner. the 94‐kda glase activity was ca++ dependent, it was inhibited by 1,10‐phenanthroline, and it was activated by organomercurial compounds. when immunoblots were performed using specific antisera against the 94‐kda gelatinase b (mmp‐9) with untreated and lps‐stimulated conditioned medium samples, a 94‐kda immunopositive band was observed. thus, it appears that the 94‐kda glase is gelatinase b (mmp‐9). these results indicate that activators of peripheral macrophages are potent secretagogues for the mmps in cultured microglia. the ability of activated microglia to secrete mmps suggests that these enzymes may play an important function in the brain parenchyma during inflammatory states. © 1995 wiley‐liss, inc.
identifying similar diseases could potentially provide deeper understanding of their underlying causes, and may even hint at possible treatments. for this purpose, it is necessary to have a similarity measure that reflects the underpinning molecular interactions and biological pathways. we have thus devised a network-based measure that can partially fulfill this goal. our method assigns weights to all proteins (and consequently their encoding genes) by using information flow from a disease to the protein interaction network and back. similarity between two diseases is then defined as the cosine of the angle between their corresponding weight vectors. the proposed method also provides a way to suggest disease-pathway associations by using the weights assigned to the genes to perform enrichment analysis for each disease. by calculating pairwise similarities between 2534 diseases, we show that our disease similarity measure is strongly correlated with the probability of finding the diseases in the same disease family and, more importantly, sharing biological pathways. we have also compared our results to those of mimminer, a text-mining method that assigns pairwise similarity scores to diseases. we find the results of the two methods to be complementary. it is also shown that clustering diseases based on their similarities and performing enrichment analysis for the cluster centers significantly increases the term association rate, suggesting that the cluster centers are better representatives for biological pathways than the diseases themselves. this lends support to the view that our similarity measure is a good indicator of relatedness of biological processes involved in causing the diseases. although not needed for understanding this paper, the raw results are available for download for further study at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/qmbpmn/diseaserelations/.  in our previous publication, a framework for information flow in interaction networks based on random walks with damping was formulated with two fundamental modes: emitting and absorbing. while many other network analysis methods based on random walks or equivalent notions have been developed before and after our earlier work, one can show that they can all be mapped to one of the two modes. in addition to these two fundamental modes, a major strength of our earlier formalism was its accommodation of context-specific directed information flow that yielded plausible and meaningful biological interpretation of protein functions and pathways. however, the directed flow from origins to destinations was induced via a potential function that was heuristic. here, with a theoretically sound approach called the channel mode, we extend our earlier work for directed information flow. this is achieved by constructing a potential function facilitating a purely probabilistic interpretation of the channel mode. for each network node, the channel mode combines the solutions of emitting and absorbing modes in the same context, producing what we call a channel tensor. the entries of the channel tensor at each node can be interpreted as the amount of flow passing through that node from an origin to a destination. similarly to our earlier model, the channel mode encompasses damping as a free parameter that controls the locality of information flow. through examples involving the yeast pheromone response pathway, we illustrate the versatility and stability of our new framework.
background rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. highly reactive oxygen free radicals are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. in this study, ra patients were sub-grouped depending upon the presence or absence of rheumatoid factor, disease activity score and disease duration. ra patients (120) and healthy controls (53) were evaluated for the oxidant—antioxidant status by monitoring ros production, biomarkers of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and dna damage. the level of various enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants was also monitored. correlation analysis was also performed for analysing the association between ros and various other parameters. methods intracellular ros formation, lipid peroxidation (mda level), protein oxidation (carbonyl level and thiol level) and dna damage were detected in the blood of ra patients. antioxidant status was evaluated by frap assay, dpph reduction assay and enzymatic (sod, catalase, gst, gr) and non-enzymatic (vitamin c and gsh) antioxidants. results ra patients showed a higher ros production, increased lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and dna damage. a significant decline in the ferric reducing ability, dpph radical quenching ability and the levels of antioxidants has also been observed. significant correlation has been found between ros and various other parameters studied. conclusion ra patients showed a marked increase in ros formation, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, dna damage and decrease in the activity of antioxidant defence system leading to oxidative stress which may contribute to tissue damage and hence to the chronicity of the disease.  abstract this study aims to elucidate plasma oxidant/antioxidant status in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). fasting blood samples were obtained from 24 patients with ra and 20 control subjects. antioxidant potential (aop) value, nonenzymatic superoxide radical scavenger activity (nssa), and malondialdehyde (mda) levels were measured to establish plasma oxidant/antioxidant status in the patient and control groups. patients with ra had lower aop and nssa but higher mda levels than those of the control subjects, which was an indication of reduced antioxidant capacity and oxidant stress in these patients. results suggest that the antioxidant system is impaired and peroxidation reactions are accelerated in patients with ra. we suppose that therapeutic use of some antioxidants may be beneficial in this regard.
background agrobacterium tumefaciens strain gv3101 (pmp90) is widely used in transient gene expression assays, including assays to study pathogen effectors and plant disease resistance mechanisms. however, inoculation of a. tumefaciens gv3101 into nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) leaves prior to infiltration with pathogenic and non-host strains of pseudomonas syringae results in suppression of macroscopic symptoms when compared with leaves pre-treated with a buffer control. methodology/findings to gain further insight into the mechanistic basis of symptom suppression by a. tumefaciens we examined the effect of pre-treatment with a. tumefaciens on the growth of p. syringae, the production of the plant signalling molecules salicylic acid (sa) and abscisic acid (aba), and the presence of callose deposits. pre-treatment with a. tumefaciens reduced aba levels, p. syringae multiplication and p. syringae-elicited sa and aba production, but promoted increased callose deposition. however, pre-treatment with a. tumefaciens did not suppress necrosis or sa production in leaves inoculated with the elicitor hrpz. conclusions/significance collectively, these results show that inoculation of n. tabacum leaves with a. tumefaciens alters plant hormone levels and plant defence responses to p. syringae, and demonstrate that researchers should consider the impact of a. tumefaciens on plant signal transduction when using a. tumefaciens-mediated transient expression assays to investigate aba-regulated processes or pathogenicity and plant defence mechanisms.  plant hormones play important roles in regulating developmental processes and signalling networks involved in plant responses to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. salicylic acid (sa), jasmonates (ja) and ethylene (et) are well known to play crucial roles in plant disease and pest resistance. however, the roles of other hormones such as abscisic acid (aba), auxin, gibberellin (ga), cytokinin (ck) and brassinosteroid (bl) in plant defence are less well known. much progress has been made in understanding plant hormone signalling and plant disease resistance. however, these studies have mostly proceeded independently of each other, and there is limited knowledge regarding interactions between plant hormone-mediated signalling and responses to various pathogens. here, we review the roles of hormones other than sa, ja and et in plant defence and the interactions between hormone-mediated signalling, plant defence and pathogen virulence. we propose that these hormones may influence disease outcomes through their effect on sa or ja signalling.
in this study the chlorophenol-degrading actinobacterium, arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6, was tested for its ability to grow on mixtures of phenolic compounds. during the experiments depletion of the compounds was monitored, as were cell growth and activity. activity assays were based on bioluminescence output from a luciferase-tagged strain. when the cells were grown on a mixture of 4-chlorophenol, 4-nitrophenol and phenol, 4-chlorophenol degradation apparently was delayed until 4-nitrophenol was almost completely depleted. phenol was degraded more slowly than the other compounds and not until 4-nitrophenol and 4-chlorophenol were depleted, despite this being the least toxic compound of the three. a similar order of degradation was observed in non-sterile soil slurries inoculated with a. chlorophenolicus. the kinetics of degradation of the substituted phenols suggest that the preferential order of their depletion could be due to their respective pka values and that the dissociated phenolate ions are the substrates. a mutant strain (t99), with a disrupted hydroxyquinol dioxygenase gene in the previously described 4-chlorophenol degradation gene cluster, was also studied for its ability to grow on the different phenols. the mutant strain was able to grow on phenol, but not on either of the substituted phenols, suggesting a different catabolic pathway for the degradation of phenol by this microorganism.  abstract arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6, a previously described 4-chlorophenol-degrading strain, was found to degrade 4-chlorophenol via hydroxyquinol, which is a novel route for aerobic microbial degradation of this compound. in addition, 10 open reading frames exhibiting sequence similarity to genes encoding enzymes involved in chlorophenol degradation were cloned and designated part of a chlorophenol degradation gene cluster (cph genes). several of the open reading frames appeared to encode enzymes with similar functions; these open reading frames included two genes, cpha-i and cpha-ii, which were shown to encode functional hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenases. disruption of the cpha-i gene yielded a mutant that exhibited negligible growth on 4-chlorophenol, thereby linking the cph gene cluster to functional catabolism of 4-chlorophenol in a. chlorophenolicus a6. the presence of a resolvase pseudogene in the cph gene cluster together with analyses of the g+c content and codon bias of flanking genes suggested that horizontal gene transfer was involved in assembly of the gene cluster during evolution of the ability of the strain to grow on 4-chlorophenol.
traditional high-throughput drug screening in oncology routinely relies on two-dimensional (2d) cell models, which inadequately recapitulate the physiologic context of cancer. three-dimensional (3d) cell models are thought to better mimic the complexity of in vivo tumors. numerous methods to culture 3d organoids have been described, but most are nonhomogeneous and expensive, and hence impractical for high-throughput screening (hts) purposes. here we describe an hts-compatible method that enables the consistent production of organoids in standard flat-bottom 384- and 1536-well plates by combining the use of a cell-repellent surface with a bioprinting technology incorporating magnetic force. we validated this homogeneous process by evaluating the effects of well-characterized anticancer agents against four patient-derived pancreatic cancer kras mutant-associated primary cells, including cancer-associated fibroblasts. this technology was tested for its compatibility with hts automation by completing a cytotoxicity pilot screen of ~3300 approved drugs. to highlight the benefits of the 3d format, we performed this pilot screen in parallel in both the 2d and 3d assays. these data indicate that this technique can be readily applied to support large-scale drug screening relying on clinically relevant, ex vivo 3d tumor models directly harvested from patients, an important milestone toward personalized medicine.  it has been >10 years since vogelstein and colleagues [(1][1] [, 2)][2] proposed a progression model for colorectal neoplasia in which they hypothesized that the progression from normal colonic epithelium, to small adenomatous polyps, to infiltrating adenocarcinoma is associated with the activation
bindin, a protein involved in sea urchin sperm-egg recognition and adhesion, is under positive selection in genera with sympatric species but evolves neutrally in genera in which all species are allopatric. this pattern has led to suggestions that reinforcement may be the source of the observed selection. reproductive character displacement, or increased divergence of reproductive characters in areas where closely related species overlap, is often a consequence of reinforcement and has been shown to be present in one indo-pacific species of the genus echinometra. in the atlantic species of the same genus, positive selection has been shown to act on bindin of echinometra lucunter. to examine whether the source of this selection is reinforcement, we determined variation on the first exon of bindin in e. lucunter in the caribbean, where it is sympatric with echinometra viridis, and in the rest of the atlantic, where e. viridis is absent. there was no differentiation between bindin sequences from the two geographic regions; similar levels of positive selection were found to be acting in both areas. the similarities were not due to gene flow; mitochondrial dna from the two regions indicates that e. lucunter populations most likely originated in the atlantic and have not exchanged genes with caribbean populations for approximately 200,000 years. the lack of evidence of stronger selection on bindin of e. lucunter in areas of sympatry with its sister species suggests that the source of selection is not reinforcement. processes acting within species, such as sexual selection, sperm competition, or sexual conflict, are more likely to be involved in the evolution of this molecule.  bindin is a gamete recognition protein known to control species-specific sperm-egg adhesion and membrane fusion in sea urchins. previous analyses have shown that diversifying selection on bindin amino acid sequence is found when gametically incompatible species are compared, but not when species are compatible. the present study analyzes bindin polymorphism and divergence in the three closely related species of echinometra in central america: e. lucunter and e. viridis from the caribbean, and e. vanbrunti from the eastern pacific. the eggs of e. lucunter have evolved a strong block to fertilization by sperm of its neotropical congeners, whereas those of the other two species have not. as in the indo-west pacific (iwp) echinometra, the neotropical species show high intraspecific bindin polymorphism in the same gene regions as in the iwp species. maximum likelihood analysis shows that many of the polymorphic codon sites are under mild positive selection. of the fixed amino acid replacements, most have accumulated along the bindin lineage of e. lucunter. we analyzed the data with maximum likelihood models of variation in positive selection across lineages and codon sites, and with models that consider sites and lineages simultaneously. our results show that positive selection is concentrated along the e. lucunter bindin lineage, and that codon sites with amino acid replacements fixed in this species show by far the highest signal of positive selection. lineage-specific positive selection paralleling egg incompatibility provides support that adaptive evolution of sperm proteins acts to maintain recognition of bindin by changing egg receptors. because both egg incompatibility and bindin divergence are greater between allopatric species than between sympatric species, the hypothesis of selection against hybridization (reinforcement) cannot explain why adaptive evolution has been confined to a single lineage in the american echinometra. instead, processes acting to varying degrees within species (e.g., sperm competition, sexual selection, and sexual conflict) are more promising explanations for lineage-specific positive selection on bindin.
purpose studies of high-performing organisations have consistently reported a positive relationship between high performance work systems (hpws) and performance outcomes. although many of these studies have been conducted in manufacturing, similar findings of a positive correlation between aspects of hpws and improved care delivery and patient outcomes have been reported in international health care studies. the purpose of this paper is to bring together the results from a series of studies conducted within australian health care organisations. first, the authors seek to demonstrate the link found between high performance work systems and organisational performance, including the perceived quality of patient care. second, the paper aims to show that the hospitals studied do not have the necessary aspects of hpws in place and that there has been little consideration of hpws in health system reform.   design/methodology/approach the paper draws on a series of correlation studies using survey data from hospitals in australia, supplemented by qualitative data collection and analysis. to demonstrate the link between hpws and perceived quality of care delivery the authors conducted regression analysis with tests of mediation and moderation to analyse survey responses of 201 nurses in a large regional australian health service and explored hrm and hpws in detail in three casestudy organisations. to achieve the second aim, the authors surveyed human resource and other senior managers in all victorian health sector organisations and reviewed policy documents related to health system reform planned for australia.   findings the findings suggest that there is a relationship between hpws and the perceived quality of care that is mediated by human resource management (hrm) outcomes, such as psychological empowerment. it is also found that health care organisations in australia generally do not have the necessary aspects of hpws in place, creating a policy and practice gap. although the chief executive officers of health service organisations reported high levels of strategic hrm, the human resource and other managers reported a distinct lack of hpws from their perspectives. the authors discuss why health care organisations may have difficulty in achieving hpws.   originality/value leaders in health care organisations should focus on ensuring human resource management systems, structures and processes that support hpws. policy makers need to consider hpws as a necessary component of health system reform. there is a strong need to reorient organisational human resource management policies and procedures in public health care organisations towards high performing work systems.  objectives this study aimed to build on the increasing evidence of a link between good people management practice, and organizational and patient outcomes in public health care to document the important human resource management practices in our hospitals. methods the design included large scale survey of hospital managers' perceptions of the use of human resource management practices. the questionnaire included human resource management (hrm) measures and additional questions related to the australian hospital accreditation standards. data were collected in december 2003 until april 2004 from a total sample of 92 hospitals/hospital organizations from the state of victoria, australia. the participants were chief executive officers, human resource directors and two other senior managers of the hospital organizations were invited to complete the questionnaire. there were no interventions. the main outcome measure, one-way analysis of variance was used to determine differences in the perceptions of the three groups of managers' concerning the use of hrm practices. frequency and descriptive statistics were used to determine use of hrm practices. results a 67% response rate enabled us to document human resource management practices in victorian hospitals. the respondents reported limited strategic and organizational hrm. conclusion this study found limited evidence of sophisticated hrm practices among hospitals and hospital organizations in the state of victoria, australia. despite the increasing evidence of a relationship among effective hrm and health-care outcomes, these hospitals reported limited performance management, training and development, and employee empowerment and decision-making. the authors suggest that it is unlikely that attempts to improve patient safety in this sector will be successful until the deficits in hrm are addressed.
introduction low-level laser therapy (lllt) has many biostimulative effects such as acceleration of mesiodistal orthodontic tooth movement. however, its effects on the extent and short-term stability of rotational tooth movement have not been researched. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of low-level laser irradiation during rotational tooth movement on the rate of movement and the amount of relapse in dogs.   methods in this interventional study, fixed orthodontic appliances were used to rotate both mandibular lateral incisors in 8 dogs. sixteen teeth were divided into 2 groups: the experimental group with lllt during orthodontic force application, and a control group with orthodontic couple force application only. in the first group, the gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser (810 nm, 200 mw, 10 seconds, 2 j/session, 32 j/cm(2)/point) was emitted on 2 points at the buccal side of the roots on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 during 4 weeks of movement, and the amount of relapse was then observed for 3 months. the extent of rotational movement was measured on dental casts, and the statistical analysis was carried out with t tests.   results there was no significant difference between the lllt group and the control group on the amount of rotational tooth movement (p = 0.66). the mean percentages of relapse after 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months were 33.02%, 53.44%, and 60.64% in the lllt group and 54.22%, 68.74%, and 73.92% in the control group, respectively. this demonstrates significant differences between these groups at all studied times (p ≤0.05). this difference was greatest in the first week and then decreased until the end of the third month. the greatest percentage of relapse in both groups was registered in the first week after tooth movement.   conclusions the total energy dose of the laser used in this study could not accelerate rotational tooth movement, but it did effectively reduce the relapse tendency in teeth rotated by orthodontic movements.  it has previously been reported that low-energy laser irradiation stimulated the velocity of tooth movement via the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa b (rank)/rank ligand and the macrophage colony-stimulating factor/its receptor (c-fms) systems. matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-9, cathepsin k, and alpha(v) beta(3) [alpha(v)beta3] integrin are essential for osteoclastogenesis; therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effects of low-energy laser irradiation on the expression of mmp-9, cathepsin k, and alpha(v)beta3 integrin during experimental tooth movement. fifty male, 6-week-old wistar strain rats were used in the experiment. a total force of 10g was applied to the rat molars to induce tooth movement. a ga-al-as diode laser was used to irradiate the area around the moving tooth and, after 7 days, the amount of tooth movement was measured. to determine the amount of tooth movement, plaster models of the maxillae were made using a silicone impression material before (day 0) and after tooth movement (days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7). the models were scanned using a contact-type three-dimensional (3-d) measurement apparatus. immunohistochemical staining for mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3 was performed. intergroup comparisons of the average values were conducted with a mann-whitney u-test for tooth movement and the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (trap), mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3-positive cells. in the laser-irradiated group, the amount of tooth movement was significantly greater than that in the non-irradiated group at the end of the experiment (p < 0.05). cells positively stained with trap, mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3 were found to be significantly increased in the irradiated group on days 2-7 compared with those in the non-irradiated group (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that low-energy laser irradiation facilitates the velocity of tooth movement and mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3 expression in rats.
the color stroop test is consensually considered as a task to assess the efficiency of inhibitory mechanisms. if the stroop interference effect is largely undisputed, it is also acknowledged that the size of this effect varies as a function of various task manipulations, such as the task format. the aim of the present study was to compare the size of adult age-related differences in inhibition as assessed by two different versions of the color stroop test: a standard blocked paper-and-pencil version and a computerized item-by-item one. results showed pronounced age-related differences in the interference effect in the blocked version, but not in the item-by-item one. these findings are discussed in terms of the characteristics of the tasks. the choice of the appropriate version with respect to clinical aims is also addressed.  the literature on interference in the stroop color-word task, covering over 50 years and some 400 studies, is organized and reviewed. in so doing, a set of 18 reliable empirical finding is isolated that must be captured by any successful theory of the stroop effect. existing theoretical positions are summarized and evaluated in view of this critical evidence and the 2 major candidate theories ―relative speed of processing and automaticity of reading― are found to be wanting. it is concluded that recent theories placing the explanatory weight on parallel processing of the irrelevant and the relevant dimensions are likely to be more sucessful than are earlier theories attempting to locate a single bottleneck in attention
the impacts of exotic plants on the pollination and reproductive success of natives have been widely reported; however, in spite of its importance for the invasive process, the role of native plants in the pollination and reproduction of exotic plants has been less explored. to fill this gap, we compared the patterns of pollination and reproductive success in the invasive herb echium vulgare (boraginaceae) between monospecific patches (only e. vulgare) and mixed patches (sympatry with native herbs schizanthus hookeri and stachys albicaulis) in central chile. using sample quadrats of 1 m × 2 m, we quantified the richness, diversity and visitation rate of flower visitors in 15-min observation intervals. we conducted an assay to assess the effect of the patch types (monospecific and mixed) and the isolation of flowers to visitors on both the fruit set and seed/ovule ratio. we showed that native plants favoured the richness of visitors of e. vulgare; however, they did not lead to increases in visitation rate. the reproductive success of e. vulgare did not show differences between contrasted patches; however, the isolation of visitors decreased the fruit set, although seed production was maintained in the absence of pollinators, presumably by an autogamous mechanism. complementary to our main research focus, we assessed changes in pollination variables and reproductive output in two coflowering native plants that occur with e. vulgare, s. hookeri and s. albicaulis. despite the fact that our correlational study did not allow us to dissect the effects of mixed patches and relative plant abundances on variables measured for natives, we observed an increase in pollinator richness in mixed patches for the two plants studied. these results suggest a potential facilitation for visitor richness of the exotic plant in coexistence with native plants, although this facilitation does not result in changes in the visit rate or on the reproductive success of any of the studied species. this work underlines the need for additional research on community levels that assess reciprocal effects on pollination between coflowering natives and exotics.  aims in ecology and conservation biology, the number of species counted in a biodiversity study is a key metric but is usually a biased underestimate of total species richness because many rare species are not detected. moreover, comparing species richness among sites or samples is a statistical challenge because the observed number of species is sensitive to the number of individuals counted or the area sampled. for individual-based data, we treat a single, empirical sample of species abundances from an investigator-defined species assemblage or community as a reference point for two estimation objectives under two sampling models: estimating the expected number of species (and its unconditional variance) in a random sample of (i) a smaller number of individuals (multinomial model) or a smaller area sampled (poisson model) and (ii) a larger number of individuals or a larger area sampled. for sample-based incidence (presence–absence) data, under a bernoulli product model, we treat a single set of species incidence frequencies as the reference point to estimate richness for smaller and larger numbers of sampling units. methods the first objective is a problem in interpolation that we address with classical rarefaction (multinomial model) and coleman rarefaction (poisson model) for individual-based data and with sample-based rarefaction (bernoulli product model) for incidence frequencies. the second is a problem in extrapolation that we address with sampling-theoretic predictors for the number of species in a larger sample (multinomial model), a larger area (poisson model) or a larger number of sampling units (bernoulli product model), based on an estimate of asymptotic species richness. although published methods exist for many of these objectives, we bring them together here with some new estimators under a unified statistical and notational framework. this novel integration of mathematically distinct approaches allowed us to link interpolated (rarefaction) curves and extrapolated curves to plot a unified species accumulation curve for empirical examples. we provide new, unconditional variance estimators for classical, individual-based rarefaction and for coleman rarefaction, long missing from the toolkit of biodiversity measurement. we illustrate these methods with datasets for tropical beetles, tropical trees and tropical ants.
research regarding geographically dispersed teams (gdts) is increasingly common and has yielded many insights into how spatio-temporal and socio-demographic factors affect gdt functioning and performance. largely missing, however, is research on the effects of the basic geographic configuration of gdts. in this study, we explore the impact of gdt configuration (i.e., the relative number of team members at different sites, independent of the characteristics of those members or the spatial and temporal distances among them) on gdt dynamics. in a quasi-experimental setting, we examine the effects of configuration using a sample of 62 six-person teams in four different one- and twosite configurations. as predicted, we find that configuration significantly affects team dynamics - independent of spatio-temporal distance and socio-demographic factors. more specifically, we find that teams with geographically-based subgroups (defined as two or more members per site) have significantly less shared team identity, less effective transactive memory, more conflict, and more coordination issues. furthermore, in teams with subgroups, imbalance (i.e., the uneven distribution of members across sites) exacerbates these effects; subgroups with a numerical minority of team members report significantly poorer scores on the same four outcomes. in contrast, teams with geographically isolated members (i.e., members who have no teammates at their site) outperform both balanced and imbalanced configurations.  as organizations operate across greater distances, scholars are increasingly interested in the work of geographically dispersed teams and the technologies that they use to communicate and coordinate their work. however, research has generally not specified the dimensions (spatial, temporal, or configurational) and degrees of team dispersion, nor has it articulated the theoretical connections between those dimensions and important team outcomes. this research essay expands upon previous field and lab studies of dispersed teamwork by presenting a new conceptualization of dispersion as a continuous, multidimensional construct, in which each dimension is theoretically linked with different outcomes. we illustrate this new conceptualization with a series of examples from real dispersed teams and present implications for research regarding technology use.
five studies tested the hypothesis that self-regulatory failure is an important predictor of intimate partner violence (ipv) perpetration. study 1 participants were far more likely to experience a violent impulse during conflictual interaction with their romantic partner than they were to enact a violent behavior, suggesting that self-regulatory processes help individuals refrain from perpetrating ipv when they experience a violent impulse. study 2 participants high in dispositional self-control were less likely to perpetrate ipv, in both cross-sectional and residualized-lagged analyses, than were participants low in dispositional self-control. study 3 participants verbalized more ipv-related cognitions if they responded immediately to partner provocations than if they responded after a 10-s delay. study 4 participants whose self-regulatory resources were experimentally depleted were more violent in response to partner provocation (but not when unprovoked) than were nondepleted participants. finally, study 5 participants whose self-regulatory resources were experimentally bolstered via a 2-week training regimen exhibited less violent inclinations than did participants whose self-regulatory resources had not been bolstered. these findings hint at the power of incorporating self-regulation dynamics into predictive models of ipv perpetration.  aggressive impulses arise from many factors, but they are usually held in check by social norms for self-control. thus, the proximal cause of aggression is often failure of self-restraint. in five studies, depleted capacity for self-regulation (caused by prior, even irrelevant acts of self-regulation) increased aggressive responding, especially after an insulting provocation. when participants were insulted and their self-regulatory strength was depleted (i.e., after completing previous tasks that required self-regulation), participants were more likely to aggress. when the urge to aggress was relatively weaker (i.e., when participants were not insulted), self-regulatory depletion did not increase aggressive behavior. this effect was moderated by trait self-control: participants low in trait self-control were particularly likely to express intentions of behaving aggressively in response to provocation, whereas participants high in trait self-control did not express intentions of responding aggressively. laboratory, autobiographical memory, and hypothetical responses confirmed the pattern.
although the transition to menopause represents a period of risk for depressive symptoms, there is little research into personality or trait-like factors that may confer vulnerability to depression during the transition to menopause. this study investigated whether the personality trait of self-criticism moderated the effects of irritability on depressive symptoms in women transitioning to menopause and whether these effects were mediated by lower levels of emotional regulation. participants were 376 women, of whom 157 had entered the transition phase to menopause. these women in the transition phase completed measures of self-criticism, irritable mood, emotional regulation, and depressive symptoms. all analyses controlled for attitudes toward menopause and somatic symptoms. moderated mediation regression analyses showed that higher levels of irritability were associated with poorer emotional regulation in highly self-critical women, but not in less self-critical women, and poorer emotional regulation was, in turn, related to higher levels depressive symptoms. findings suggest that the transition to menopause may represent an especially vulnerable period for women with high levels of self-criticism. although irritability is transitory for most women, for women who are highly self-critical, irritability may tax their ability to self-regulate and lead to more encompassing symptoms of depression.  a select group of investigators attended a structured workshop, the stages of reproductive aging workshop (straw), at park city, utah, usa, in july 2001, which addressed the need in women for a staging system as well as the confusing nomenclature for the reproductive years.
during the maintenance period of propofol-induced general anesthesia, specific changes in spontaneous eeg rhythms can be observed. these comprise increased delta and theta power and the emergence of alpha oscillations over frontal regions. in this study we use a meanfield model of the thalamo-cortical system to reproduce these changes and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. the model is able to reproduce the most dominant changes in the eeg and suggests that they are caused by the amplification of resonances within the thalamo-cortical system. specifically, while observed increases in delta and alpha power are reflections of amplified resonances in the respective frequency bands, increases in theta power are caused indirectly by spectral power leakage from delta and alpha bands. the model suggests that these changes are brought about through increased inhibition within local cortical interneuron circuits. these results are encouraging and motivate more extensive use of neural meanfield models in elucidating the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of pharmacological agents on macroscopic brain dynamics.  the neuronal mechanisms of general anesthesia are still poorly understood. besides several characteristic features of anesthesia observed in experiments, a prominent effect is the bi-phasic change of power in the observed electroencephalogram (eeg), i.e. the initial increase and subsequent decrease of the eeg-power in several frequency bands while increasing the concentration of the anaesthetic agent. the present work aims to derive analytical conditions for this bi-phasic spectral behavior by the study of a neural population model. this model describes mathematically the effective membrane potential and involves excitatory and inhibitory synapses, excitatory and inhibitory cells, nonlocal spatial interactions and a finite axonal conduction speed. the work derives conditions for synaptic time constants based on experimental results and gives conditions on the resting state stability. further the power spectrum of local field potentials and eeg generated by the neural activity is derived analytically and allow for the detailed study of bi-spectral power changes. we find bi-phasic power changes both in monostable and bistable system regime, affirming the omnipresence of bi-spectral power changes in anesthesia. further the work gives conditions for the strong increase of power in the δ-frequency band for large propofol concentrations as observed in experiments.
a localized modulated radiation force can be produced when two confocal ultrasound beams of nearly equal frequencies interfere in an attenuating medium such as tissue. it is well-established that this force generates both shear and longitudinal waves. by scanning the focal point over a plane and observing the propagation of these waves, the mechanical properties of the medium can be imaged. in this paper, the modulated radiation force is analytically derived in the case of attenuating media, by expanding on the theory of ultrasound-stimulated-vibro-acoustography (usva) for lossless media. furthermore, weak nonlinearities are considered in the formulation, since higher source pressures may prove to be necessary to improve the radiation-force profile - only the fundamental component is, however, studied in this paper. an analysis of the generated radiation force is performed and the effects of various parameters are investigated on its amplitude and spatial distribution. it will be shown that by carefully selecting the confocal geometry of the beams, as well as, the source pressure and center frequency, the spatial profile of the radiation force can be optimized. this, subsequently, could improve not only the resolution of the point-spread-function in usva, but also, the profile of the shear waves in elastography applications.  we describe theoretical principles of an imaging modality that uses the acoustic response of an object to a highly localized dynamic radiation force of an ultrasound field. in this method, named ultrasound-stimulated vibro-acoustography (usva), ultrasound is used to exert a low-frequency (in khz range) force on the object. in response, a portion of the object vibrates sinusoidally in a pattern determined by its viscoelastic properties. the acoustic emission field resulting from object vibration is detected and used to form an image that represents both the ultrasonic and low-frequency (khz range) mechanical characteristics of the object. we report the relation between the emitted acoustic field and the incident ultrasonic pressure field in terms of object parameters. also, we present the point-spread function of the imaging system. the experimental images in this report have a resolution of about 700 microm, high contrast, and high signal-to-noise ratio. usva is sensitive enough to detect object motions on the order of nanometers. possible applications include medical imaging and material evaluation.
microrna-218 (mir-218) acts as a tumor suppressor in numerous types of cancer by regulation of the expression of target genes. the aim of this study was to investigate whether polymorphisms in mir-218 lamb3 pathway were associated with the risk and prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc). pri-mir-218 rs11134527 and lamb3 rs2566 were genotyped in escc patients and 745 controls to assess their associations with cancer risk and overall survival. pri-mir-218 rs11134527 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of escc under codominant, recessive and additive models. although there was a significant association between rs11134527 and better survival of escc patients under codominant, recessive and additive models, the association disappeared after adjustment for tnm and lnm. however, further stratified analysis revealed that the association remained significant in patients with tnm stages i and ii or non-lnm. our data suggest that pri-mir-218 rs11134527 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility and prognosis for escc in chinese han population.  cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. more than 275,100 women die from cervical cancer each year. cervical squamous cell carcinoma (cervical scc), one of the most frequent types of cervical cancers, is associated with high-risk human papilloma virus (hpv), although hpv infection alone may not be enough to induce malignant transformation. micrornas (mirnas), a class of small non-coding rnas, regulate protein-coding gene expression by repressing translation or cleaving rna transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. a growing body of evidence suggests that mirnas contribute to cervical scc progression, development and metastasis. mirna expression signatures in scc (hypopharyngeal scc and esophageal scc) revealed that mir-218 expression was significantly reduced in cancer tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous epithelium, suggesting that mir-218 is a candidate tumor suppressor. the aim of this study was to investigate the functional significance of mir-218 in cervical scc and to identify novel mir-218-mediated cancer pathways in cervical scc. restoration of mir-218 significantly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion in both hpv-positive and hpv-negative cervical scc cell lines. these data indicated that mir-218 acts as a tumor suppressor in cervical scc. our in silico analysis showed that mir-218 appeared to be an important modulator of tumor cell processes through suppression of many targets, particularly those involved in focal adhesion signaling pathways. gene expression data indicated that lamb3, a laminin protein known to influence cell differentiation, migration, adhesion, proliferation and survival, was upregulated in cervical scc clinical specimens, and silencing studies demonstrated that lamb3 functioned as an oncogene in cervical scc. the identification of novel tumor-suppressive mir-218-mediated molecular pathways has provided new insights into cervical scc oncogenesis and metastasis.
introductiondelirium is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery. although various risk factors for postoperative delirium have been identified, the relationship between nocturnal breathing disorders and delirium has not yet been elucidated. this study evaluated the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing (sdb) and postoperative delirium in cardiac surgery patients without a previous diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.methodsin this prospective cohort study, 92 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation were evaluated for both sdb and postoperative delirium. polygraphic recordings were used to calculate the apnea-hypopnea index (ahi; mean number of apneas and hypopneas per hour recorded) of all patients preoperatively. delirium was assessed during the first four postoperative days using the confusion assessment method. clinical differences between individuals with and without postoperative delirium were determined with univariate analysis. the relationship between postoperative delirium and those covariates that were associated with delirium in univariate analysis was determined by a multivariate logistic regression model.resultsthe median overall preoperative ahi was 18.3 (interquartile range, 8.7 to 32.8). delirium was diagnosed in 44 patients. the median ahi differed significantly between patients with and without postoperative delirium (28 versus 13; p = 0.001). a preoperative ahi of 19 or higher was associated with an almost sixfold increased risk of postoperative delirium (odds ratio, 6.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 15.4; p <0.001). multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative ahi, age, smoking, and blood transfusion were independently associated with postoperative delirium.conclusionspreoperative sdb (for example, undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea) were strongly associated with postoperative delirium, and may be a risk factor for postoperative delirium.  background and objective:  osa is a common condition associated with cardiovascular (cv) morbidity. it remains underdiagnosed globally in part due to the limited availability and technical requirements of polysomnography (psg). the aim of this study was to test the accuracy of two simple methods for diagnosing osa.
backgroundrna viruses rapidly accumulate genetic variation, which can give rise to synthetic lethal (sl) and deleterious (sd) mutations. synthetic lethal mutations (non-lethal when alone but lethal when combined in one genome) have been studied to develop cancer therapies. this principle can also be used against fast-evolving rna-viruses. indeed, targeting protein sites involved in sd + sl interactions with a drug would render any mutation of such sites, lethal.resultshere, we set up a strategy to detect intragenic pairs of sl and sd at the surface of the protein to predict less escapable drug target sites. for this, we detected sd + sl, studying hiv protease (pr) and reverse transcriptase (rt) sequence alignments from two groups of vih+ individuals: treated with drugs (t) or not (nt). using a series of statistical approaches, we were able to propose bona fide sd + sl couples. when focusing on spatially close co-variant sd + sl couples at the surface of the protein, we found 5 sd + sl groups (2 in the protease and 3 in the reverse transcriptase), which could be good candidates to form pockets to accommodate potential drugs.conclusionsthus, designing drugs targeting these specific sd + sl groups would not allow the virus to mutate any residue involved in such groups without losing an essential function. moreover, we also show that the selection pressure induced by the treatment leads to the appearance of new mutations, which change the mutational landscape of the protein. this drives the existence of differential sd + sl couples between the drug-treated and non-treated groups. thus, new anti-viral drugs should be designed differently to target such groups.reviewersthis article was reviewed by neil greenspan csaba pal and istván simon.  l-735,524 is a potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) protease currently in a phase ii clinical trial. we report here the three-dimensional structure of l-735,524 complexed to hiv-2 protease at 1.9-a resolution, as well as the structure of the native hiv-2 protease at 2.5-a resolution. the structure of hiv-2 protease is found to be essentially identical to that of hiv-1 protease. in the crystal lattice of the hiv-2 protease complexed with l-735,524, the inhibitor is chelated to the active site of the homodimeric enzyme in one orientation. this feature allows an unambiguous assignment of protein-ligand interactions from the electron density map. both fourier and difference fourier maps reveal clearly the closure of the flap domains of the protease upon l-735,524 binding. specific interactions between the enzyme and the inhibitor include the hydroxy group of the hydroxyaminopentane amide moiety of l-735,524 ligating to the carboxyl groups of the essential asp-25 and asp-25' enzymic residues and the amide oxygens of the inhibitor hydrogen bonding to the backbone amide nitrogen of ile-50 and ile-50' via an intervening water molecule. a second bridging water molecule is found between the amide nitrogen n2 of l-735,524 and the carboxyl oxygen of asp-29'. although other hydrogen bonds also add to binding, an equally significant contribution to affinity arises from hydrophobic interactions between the protease and the inhibitor throughout the pseudo-symmetric s1/s1', s2/s2', and s3/s3' regions of the enzyme. except for its pyridine ring, all lipophilic moieties (t-butyl, indanyl, benzyl, and piperidyl) of l-735,524 are rigidly defined in the active site.
background: the impact of very low levels of air pollutants, particulate matter (pm10) and sulfur dioxide (so2) concentrations, on human health is not well characterized. we examined the outcomes (30-day in-hospital mortality) of emergency hospitalizations of respiratory patients and the level of local pollutants on the day of admission. methods: all emergency admissions (82,421 episodes in 44,660 patients) were recorded over 13 years (2002–2014) and mortality assessed. the median interquartile ranges (iqr) age was 64.5 (43.9, 78.5) years with the proportion of males at 48.5%. univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to examine relationships between pollutant concentration (pm10 and so2) and odds ratio (or) for 30-day in hospital death, after adjustment for acuity. results: mortality related to each pollutant variable assessed (as quintiles of increasing atmospheric concentration). for pm10 mortality, the highest two quintiles concentrations were significantly increased (p < 0.001) with univariate ors of 1.30. for so2, the ors were 1.32, 1.39, and 1.46, for the top three quintiles. there was also a strong relationship between the underlying respiratory function; with forced expiratory volume (fev1) in 1 second (fev1) ≥ 2.0l at the lowest pm10 quintile, mortality was 6.5% (95% ci: 6.1, 6.9) increasing to 9.5% (95% ci: 9.0, 10.0) at the highest pm10 quintile. for patients with fev1 < 2.0l, the mortality at the lowest pm10 quintile was 9.9% (95% ci: 8.8, 10.9) increasing to 14.2% (95% ci: 12.8, 15.6) at the highest quintile. conclusion: despite air quality improvement, there was a clear relationship between pollutant concentration and outcomes for respiratory emergency admissions; additionally, the underlying level of pulmonary function was predictive of in-hospital mortality.  in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, several episodes of extreme air pollution focused attention on the potential for adverse health effects of air pollution. these included an episode in the meuse valley, belgium, in december 1930 ( 15), an episode in donora, pennsylvania in 1948 (36), and several episodes in london, england (23, 44). the sudden large increases in sickness and death that accompanied such episodes demonstrated that air pollution can adversely affect human health. the increased mortality associated with such episodes provided the first quantitative measure of the adverse effects of air pollution. by the 1970s, a link had been well established between respiratory disease and particulate and/or sulfur-oxide air pollution, but still there remained disagreement as to the level of pollution that would significantly affect human health. in reviewing research published between 1968 and 1977, holland and several other prominent british scientists ( 19) concluded that particulate and related air pollution at high levels pose hazards to human health, but that health effects of particulate pollution at lower concentrations could not be "disentangled" from health effects of other factors. shy (45) responded by asserting that the review by holland et al systematically discounted evidence of pollution-related health effects at contemporary pollution levels. shy, and other reviewers ( 1, 12, 45, 54), contended that the cumulative weight of evidence provided sound reasons to believe that
developing seeds are expected to be strongly defended against microbial attack. in keeping with this, only 26% of seeds of centaurea stoebe from its native and invaded ranges in eurasia and north america were infected with fungi, and 92.2% of those were infected with a single fungus per seed. even when developing seeds in flower heads were inoculated under conducive conditions for infection with 14 of these seed-infecting fungi, re-isolation of inoculants was only 16% overall, and again limited to the particular inoculant. environmental fungi (i.e. those not isolated from seed of c. stoebe) were present in control flower heads under conditions conducive to infection but they were never re-isolated from fully developed seeds in any experiments. when two or three seed isolates were co-inoculated to compete in flower heads, only one inoculant, and always the same one, was re-isolated from all matured seeds, regardless of maternal plant genotype. pcr-based detection methods confirmed that these fungal interactions were exclusionary rather than suppressive. in these strongly defended, developing seeds, we had expected the plant to control not only the overall level of infection but also the outcome of co-inoculations. consequences for the next plant generation of this exclusionary competition among seed-infecting fungi included effects on seedling emergence, growth and fecundity.  fungal endophytes are important in plant ecology and common in plants. we attempted to test cointroduction and host-jumping hypotheses on a community basis by comparing endophytes isolated from invasive spotted knapweed (centaurea stoebe, asteraceae) in its native and invaded ranges. of 92 combined, sequence-based haplotypes representing eight classes of fungi, 78 occurred in only one of the two ranges. in the native range of c. stoebe, one haplotype of alternaria alternata was clearly dominant, whereas in the invaded range, no haplotype was dominant. many haplotypes were closely related to one another and novel. for example, six putative, new species of botrytis were discovered as endophytes of c. stoebe, which has never been reported to have botrytis spp.. apparent differences between the two communities of endophytes were significant according to an analysis of similarity, but phylogenetic community structure did not differ significantly between the ranges. both host-jumping and cointroduction of fungal endophytes likely took place during the spotted knapweed invasion.
the intestine exerts a considerable influence over urinary oxalate in two ways, through the absorption of dietary oxalate and by serving as an adaptive extra-renal pathway for elimination of this waste metabolite. knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for oxalate absorption and secretion by the intestine therefore have significant implications for understanding the etiology of hyperoxaluria, as well as offering potential targets for future treatment strategies for calcium oxalate kidney stone disease. in this review, we present the recent developments and advances in this area over the past 10 years, and put to the test some of the new ideas that have emerged during this time, using human and mouse models. a key focus for our discussion are the membrane-bound anion exchangers, belonging to the slc26 gene family, some of which have been shown to participate in transcellular oxalate absorption and secretion. this has offered the opportunity to not only examine the roles of these specific transporters, revealing their importance to oxalate homeostasis, but to also probe the relative contributions made by the active transcellular and passive paracellular components of oxalate transport across the intestine. we also discuss some of the various physiological stimuli and signaling pathways which have been suggested to participate in the adaptation and regulation of intestinal oxalate transport. finally, we offer an update on research into oxalobacter formigenes, alongside recent investigations of other oxalate-degrading gut bacteria, in both laboratory animals and humans.  active transcellular oxalate transport in the mammalian intestine contributes to the homeostasis of this important lithogenic anion. several members of the slc26a gene family of anion exchangers have a measurable oxalate affinity and are expressed along the gut, apically and basolaterally. mouse slc26a6 (pat1) targets to the apical membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine, and its deletion results in net oxalate absorption and hyperoxaluria. apical exchangers of the slc26a family that mediate oxalate absorption have not been established, yet the slc26a3 [downregulated in adenoma (dra)] protein is a candidate mediator of oxalate uptake. we evaluated the role of dra in intestinal oxalate and cl(-) transport by comparing unidirectional and net ion fluxes across short-circuited segments of small (ileum) and large (cecum and distal colon) intestine from wild-type (wt) and dra knockout (ko) mice. in wt mice, all segments demonstrated net oxalate and cl(-) absorption to varying degrees. in ko mice, however, all segments exhibited net anion secretion, which was consistently, and solely, due to a significant reduction in the absorptive unidirectional fluxes. in ko mice, daily urinary oxalate excretion was reduced 66% compared with that in wt mice, while urinary creatinine excretion was unchanged. we conclude that dra mediates a predominance of the apical uptake of oxalate and cl(-) absorbed in the small and large intestine of mice under short-circuit conditions. the large reductions in urinary oxalate excretion underscore the importance of transcellular intestinal oxalate absorption, in general, and, more specifically, the importance of the dra exchanger in oxalate homeostasis.
development of generic differentiation protocols that function in a range of independently-derived human embryonic stem cell (hesc) lines remains challenging due to considerable diversity in culture methods practiced between lines. maintenance of bg01 and hues-7 has routinely been on mouse embryonic fibroblast (mef) feeder layers using manual- and trypsin-passaging, respectively. we adapted both lines to trypsin-passaging on feeders or on matrigel in feeder-free conditions and assessed proliferation and cardiac differentiation. on feeders, undifferentiated proliferation of bg01 and hues-7 was supported by all three media tested (bg-sk, hues-c and hues-nl), although incidence of karyotypic instability increased in both lines in bg-sk. on matrigel, ksr-containing conditioned medium (cm) promoted undifferentiated cell proliferation, while differentiation occurred in cm containing plasmanate or es-screened fetal bovine serum (fbs) and in unconditioned medium containing 100 ng/ml bfgf. matrigel cultures were advantageous for transfection but detrimental to embryoid body (eb) formation. however, transfer of hescs from matrigel back to feeders and culturing to confluence was found to rescue eb formation. ebs formed efficiently when hescs on feeders were treated with collagenase, harvested by scraping and then cultured in suspension in cm. subsequent culture in fbs-containing medium produced spontaneously contracting ebs, for which the mean beat rate was 37.2 +/- 2.3 and 41.1 +/- 3.1 beats/min for bg01-ebs and hues-7-ebs, respectively. derived cardiomyocytes expressed cardiac genes and responded to pharmacological stimulation. therefore the same culture and differentiation conditions functioned in two independently-derived hesc lines. similar studies in other lines may facilitate development of universal protocols.  this report, first published online on march 3, 2004, discusses the procedures used to develop 17 lines of human embryonic stem cells from the inner cell masses of blastocysts. these cell lines are available to researchers under a material transfer agreement; according to current regulations, the cells cannot be used for research supported by federal funds. these cells are expected to facilitate research on a variety of serious chronic diseases.
to identify regions involved in tissue specific regulation of transcription of the alpha1(vi) collagen chain, transgenic mice were generated carrying various portions of the gene's 5'-flanking sequence fused to the e. coli beta-galactosidase gene. analysis of the transgene expression pattern by x-gal staining of embryos revealed that: (a) the proximal 0.6 kb of promoter sequence activated transcription in mesenchymal cells at sites of insertion of superficial muscular aponeurosis into the skin; tendons were also faintly positive. (b) the region between -4.0 and -5.4 kb from the transcription start site was required for activation of the transgene in nerves. it also drove expression in joints, in intervertebral disks, and in subepidermal and vibrissae mesenchyme. (c) the fragment comprised within -6.2 and -7.5 kb was necessary for high level transcription in skeletal muscle and meninges. positive cells in muscle were mostly mononuclear and probably included connective tissue elements, although staining of myoblasts was not ruled out. this fragment also activated expression in joints, in intervertebral disks, and in subepidermal and vibrissae mesenchyme. (d) beta-galactosidase staining in vibrissae induced by the sequences -4.0 to -5.4 and -6.2 to -7.5 was not coincident: with the latter sequence labeled nuclei were found mainly in the ventral and posterior quadrant, and, histologically, in the outer layers of mesenchyme surrounding and between the follicles, whereas with the former the remaining quadrants were positive and expressing cells were mostly in the inner layers of the dermal sheath. (e) other tissues, notably lung, adrenal gland, digestive tract, which produce high amounts of collagen type vi, did not stain for beta-galactosidase. (f) central nervous system and retina, in which the endogenous gene is inactive, expressed the lacz transgene in most lines. the data suggest that transcription of alpha1(vi) in different tissues is regulated by distinct sequence elements in a modular arrangement, a mechanism which confers high flexibility in the temporal and spatial pattern of expression during development.  the expression of type vi collagen has been studied in mouse tissues. by northern blotting, the mrna for the alpha 1 (vi) chain was detectable in whole embryos at 10.5 days postcoitum and steeply increased afterward. the messenger levels were high at birth, but decreased rapidly in the following days, reaching low levels in adult animals. in 2-month-old mice, lung, skin, adrenal gland, heart, skeletal muscle and tail and fat were among the most active producers of alpha 1 (vi) mrna. in situ hybridization first identified mrna for alpha 1 (vi) collagen in mesenchymal cells of 10.5-day embryos in various locations, including serosae, branchial arches, large blood vessels and the cephalic mesenchyme. staining increased at later stages of development and most connective tissues were positive at 16.5 days and later. strongly staining tissues were joints, intervertebral disks, perichondrium, periostium, dermis, skeletal muscle and heart valves, whereas cartilage and bone were very poorly labelled. epithelia and the central nervous system were completely negative. in several organs, notably lung, salivary glands and the digestive tract, staining was concentrated underneath epithelia. this staining pattern was different from that for collagen type i, which was evenly distributed in the subepithelial mesenchyme. the pattern of distribution of the protein, revealed by immunocytochemistry, was coincident with that of the alpha 1 (vi) mrna. in addition, the results confirmed that type vi collagen is preferentially deposited in the pericellular environment. this was particularly evident in skeletal muscle. the data show that type vi collagen is mainly produced by mesenchymal cells and suggest a role for the protein in delineating the boundary of distinct domains in connective tissue.
the suppressor of cytokine signaling (socs) proteins are critical, highly conserved feedback inhibitors of signal transduction cascades. the family of socs proteins is divided into two groups: ancestral and vertebrate-specific socs proteins. vertebrate-specific socs proteins have been heavily studied as a result of their strong mutant phenotypes. however, the ancestral clade remains less studied, a potential result of genetic redundancies in mammals. use of the genetically tractable organism drosophila melanogaster enables in vivo assessment of signaling components and mechanisms with less concern about the functional redundancy observed in mammals. in this study, we investigated how the socs family member suppressor of cytokine signaling at 36e (socs36e) attenuates janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (jak/stat) activation during specification of motile border cells in drosophila oogenesis. we found that socs36e genetically interacts with the cullin2 (cul2) scaffolding protein. like socs36e, cul2 is required to limit the number of motile cells in egg chambers. we demonstrated that loss of cul2 in the follicle cells significantly increased nuclear stat protein levels, which resulted in additional cells acquiring invasive properties. further, reduction of cul2 suppressed border cell migration defects that occur in a stat92e-sensitized genetic background. our data incorporated cul2 into a previously described jak/stat-directed genetic regulatory network that is required to generate a discrete boundary between cell fates. we also found that socs36e is able to attenuate stat activity in the egg chamber when it does not have a functional socs box. collectively, this work contributes mechanistic insight to a jak/stat regulatory genetic circuit, and suggests that socs36e regulates jak/stat signaling via a cul2-dependent mechanism, as well as by a cullin-independent manner, in vivo.  patterns of cell fates generated by morphogens are critically important for normal development; however, the mechanisms by which graded morphogen signals are converted into all-or-none cell fate responses are incompletely understood. in the drosophila ovary, high and sustained levels of the secreted morphogen unpaired (upd) specify the migratory border-cell population by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat). a lower or transient level of stat activity specifies a non-migratory population of follicle cells. here we identify mir-279 as a component of a feedback pathway that further dampens the response in cells with low levels of jak/stat activity. mir-279 directly repressed stat, and loss of mir-279 mimicked stat gain-of-function or loss of apontic (apt), a known feedback inhibitor of stat. apt was essential for mir-279 expression in non-migratory follicle cells, whereas another stat target, ken and barbie (ken), downregulated mir-279 in border cells. mathematical modelling and simulations of this regulatory circuit including mir-279, apt and ken supported key roles for mir-279 and apt in generating threshold responses to the upd gradient.
abstract the ability to form positive mental images may be an important aspect of mental health and well-being. we have previously demonstrated that the vividness of positive prospective imagery is increased in healthy older adults following positive imagery cognitive training. the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (racc) is involved in the simulation of future affective episodes. here, we investigate the effect of positive imagery training on racc activity during the imagination of novel, ambiguous scenarios vs closely matched control training. seventy-five participants received 4 weeks of positive imagery or control training. participants underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, during which they completed an ambiguous sentences task, which required them to form mental images in response to cues describing ambiguous social events. racc activity was positively correlated with the pleasantness ratings of images formed. positive imagery training increased racc and bilateral hippocampal activity compared with the control training. here, we demonstrate that racc activity during positive imagery can be changed by the cognitive training. this is consistent with other evidence that this training enhances the vividness of positive imagery, and suggests the training may be acting to increase the intensity and affective quality of imagery simulating the future.  we can imagine looking at ourselves (observer perspective) or through our own eyes (field perspective). cognitive and clinical theories suggest that compared to field perspective, observer perspective imagery reduces emotional intensity, for example, of trauma memories. tests of causality are lacking and less is known about perspective and positive emotion. using contrasting experimental manipulations, participants imagined 100 positive descriptions from either (1) a field perspective or (2) an observer perspective, or (3) thought about their verbal meaning. affect was more positive after field than observer imagery and verbal conditions, with mood deterioration within the latter two. findings are the first to demonstrate causality of imagery perspective on emotion. further, the results demonstrate that imagining positive events from one's own perspective is critical to improving positive affect. treatment implications include promoting field imagery to facilitate a more rose-tinted view of positive events.
using a new-keynesian model with endogenous capital accumulation, i show that uncertainty about fiscal policy can cause large declines in consumption, investment, and output when the zero lower bound (zlb) binds, but has modest effects when the monetary authority is not constrained by the zlb. i study uncertainty about the level of government spending and uncertainty about tax rates on consumption, wages, capital income, and investment. in my model, uncertainty about government spending and the wage tax rate has particularly large effects. i show that the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty are largest when the nominal interest rate is on the cusp of the zlb and also that delaying fiscal policy uncertainty diminishes its effects only if the resolution of uncertainty occurs after zlb no longer binds.  many commentators argue that uncertainty about taxes, government spending and other policy matters deepened the recession of 2007-2009 and slowed the recovery. to investigate this issue we develop a new index of policy-related economic uncertainty and estimate its dynamic relationship to output, investment and employment. our index averages several components that reflect the frequency of news media references to economic policy uncertainty, the number of federal tax code provisions set to expire in future years, and the extent of forecaster disagreement over future inflation and federal government purchases. the index spikes near consequential presidential elections and after major events such as the gulf wars and the 9/11 attack. index values are very high in recent years with clear jumps around the lehman bankruptcy and tarp legislation, the 2010 midterm elections, the eurozone crisis and the u.s. debt-ceiling dispute. we also construct an index of european economic policy uncertainty mirroring our american news-based index. var estimates show that an increase in policy uncertainty equal to the actual change between 2006 and 2011 foreshadows large and persistent declines in aggregate outcomes, with peak declines of 3.2% in real gdp, 16% in private investment and 2.3 million in aggregate employment. jel no. d80, e22, e66, g18, l50
recent experimental evidence indicates that in the neocortex, the manner in which each synapse releases neurotransmitter in response to trains of presynaptic action potentials is potentially unique. these unique transmission characteristics arise because of a large heterogeneity in various synaptic properties that determine frequency dependence of transmission such as those governing the rates of synaptic depression and facilitation. a theoretical analysis was therefore undertaken to explore the phenomenologies of changes in the values of these synaptic parameters. the results illustrate how the change in any one of several synaptic parameters produces a distinctive effect on synaptic transmission and how these distinctive effects can point to the most likely biophysical mechanisms. these results could therefore be useful in studies of synaptic plasticity in order to obtain a full characterization of the phenomenologies of synaptic modifications and to isolate potential biophysical mechanisms. based on this theoretical analysis and experimental data, it is proposed that there exists multiple mechanisms, phenomena and algorithms for synaptic plasticity at single synapses. finally, it is shown that the impact of changing the values of synaptic parameters depends on the values of the other parameters. this may indicate that the various mechanisms, phenomena and algorithms are interlinked in a 'synaptic plasticity code'.  experience-dependent potentiation and depression of synaptic strength has been proposed to subserve learning and memory by changing the gain of signals conveyed between neurons1,2. here we examine synaptic plasticity between individual neocortical layer-5 pyramidal neurons. we show that an increase in the synaptic response, induced by pairing action-potential activity in pre- and postsynaptic neurons, was only observed when synaptic input occurred at low frequencies. this frequency-dependent increase in synaptic responses arises because of a redistribution of the available synaptic efficacy and not because of an increase in the efficacy. redistribution of synaptic efficacy could represent a mechanism to change the content, rather than the gain, of signals conveyed between neurons.
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) and p-glycoprotein (p-gp) are atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters that have two transmembrane domains (tmds) and two nucleotide-binding domains (nbds). defective folding of cftr lacking phenylalanine 508 (δphe508) in nbd1 is the most common cause of cystic fibrosis. the phe508 position seems to be universally important in abc transporters because deletion of the equivalent residue (tyr490) in p-gp also inhibits maturation of the protein. the pharmacological chaperone vrt-325 can repair the δphe508-type folding defects in p-gp or cftr. vrt-325 may repair the folding defects by promoting dimerization of the two nbds or by promoting folding of the tmds. to distinguish between these two mechanisms, we tested the ability of vrt-325 to promote folding of truncation mutants lacking one or both nbds. sensitivity to glycosidases was used as an indirect indicator of folding. it was found that vrt-325 could promote maturation of truncation mutants lacking nbd2. truncation mutants of cftr or p-gp lacking both nbds showed deficiencies in core-glycosylation that could be partially reversed by carrying out expression in the presence of vrt-325. the results show that dimerization of the two nbds to form a “nucleotide-sandwich” structure or nbd interactions with the tmds are not essential for vrt-325 enhancement of folding. instead, vrt-325 can promote folding of the tmds alone. the ability of vrt-325 to promote core-glycosylation of the nbd-less truncation mutants suggests that one mechanism whereby the compound enhances folding is by promoting proper insertion of tm segments attached to the glycosylated loops so that they adopt an orientation favorable for glycosylation.  the most common cause of cystic fibrosis (cf) is deletion of phenylalanine 508 (deltaf508) in the cf transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) chloride channel. the deltaf508 mutation produces defects in folding, stability, and channel gating. to identify small-molecule correctors of defective cellular processing, we assayed iodide flux in deltaf508-cftr-transfected epithelial cells using a fluorescent halide indicator. screening of 150,000 chemically diverse compounds and more than 1,500 analogs of active compounds yielded several classes of deltaf508-cftr correctors (aminoarylthiazoles, quinazolinylaminopyrimidinones, and bisaminomethylbithiazoles) with micromolar potency that produced greater apical membrane chloride current than did low-temperature rescue. correction was seen within 3-6 hours and persisted for more than 12 hours after washout. functional correction was correlated with plasma membrane expression of complex-glycosylated deltaf508-cftr protein. biochemical studies suggested a mechanism of action involving improved deltaf508-cftr folding at the er and stability at the cell surface. the bisaminomethylbithiazoles corrected deltaf508-cftr in deltaf508/deltaf508 human bronchial epithelia but did not correct a different temperature-sensitive cftr mutant (p574h-cftr) or a dopamine receptor mutant. small-molecule correctors may be useful in the treatment of cf caused by the deltaf508 mutation.
a two-stage pretreatment approach, employing steam followed by organosolv treatment, was assessed for its ability to fractionate and recover most of the hemicellulose, lignin and cellulose components of poplar wood chips. a mild steaming stage was initially used to maximise hemicellulose sugar recovery, with 63% of the original xylan solubilised and recovered after this stage and close to 90% recovered in total. rather than hindering subsequent organosolv delignification, the prior steam treatment enhanced lignin solubilisation with more than 66% of the original lignin removed after the two-stage pretreatment. the extracted lignin contained at least equal or greater amounts of functional groups as compared to the lignin solubilised after a single-stage organosolv pretreatment. more than 98% of the original cellulose was recovered after the two-stage pretreatment and 88% of the cellulose could be hydrolysed to glucose at enzyme loading of 5fpu/g cellulose after 72h.  an organosolv process involving extraction with hot aqueous ethanol has been evaluated for bioconversion of hybrid poplar to ethanol. the process resulted in fractionation of poplar chips into a cellulose‐rich solids fraction, an ethanol organosolv lignin (eol) fraction, and a water‐soluble fraction containing hemicellulosic sugars, sugar breakdown products, degraded lignin, and other components. the influence of four independent process variables (temperature, time, catalyst dose, and ethanol concentration) on product yields was analyzed over a broad range using a small composite design and response surface methodology. center point conditions for the composite design (180°c, 60 min, 1.25% h2so4, and 60% ethanol), yielded a solids fraction containing ∼88% of the cellulose present in the untreated poplar. approximately 82% of the total cellulose in the untreated poplar was recovered as monomeric glucose after hydrolysis of the solids fraction for 24 h using a low enzyme loading (20 filter paper units of cellulase/g cellulose); ∼85% was recovered after 48 h hydrolysis. total recovery of xylose (soluble and insoluble) was equivalent to ∼72% of the xylose present in untreated wood. approximately 74% of the lignin in untreated wood was recovered as eol. other cooking conditions resulted in either similar or inferior product yields although the distribution of components between the various fractions differed markedly. data analysis generated regression models that describe process responses for any combination of the four variables. © 2006 wiley periodicals, inc.
this paper seeks to fill a gap in the literature by analyzing inflation in poland, one of only two transition economies that have adopted a strict inflation-targeting policy. the paper also introduces a new method for selecting inflation indicators. consistent with the earlier literature, empirical results find a strong link between the producer price index and consumer price index in poland. this shows the importance of the manufacturing sector in determining the price level in the country. overall, wages, broad money supply and the exchange rate are good indicators of inflation.  the modified yule-walker technique of arma spectral estimation is shown to be a special case of the instrumental variable method of system identification. several recursive instrumental variable algorithms are proposed for adaptive spectral estimation. an efficient lattice algorithm is presented for solving the modified yule-walker equations in the overdetermined case.
introduction: our aim in this study was to examine whether the muscle fiber type proportions in different muscles from the same individual are interrelated. methods: samples were excised from five skeletal muscles in each of 12 human autopsy cases, and the fiber type proportions were determined by immunohistochemistry. we further examined the intermuscular relationship in fiber type proportion by reanalyzing three previously published data sets involving other muscles. results: subjects demonstrated a predominantly high or low proportion of type 1 fibers in all examined muscles, and the overall difference between individuals was statistically significant (p < 0.001). accordingly, the type 1 fiber proportions in most muscles were positively correlated (median r = 0.42, range −0.03–0.80). similar results were also obtained from the three reanalyzed data sets. conclusions: we suggest the existence of an across‐muscle phenotype with respect to fiber type proportions; some individuals display generally faster muscles and some individuals slower muscles when compared with others. muscle nerve, 2012  biopsies of ventral neck muscles (sternocleidomastoid, omohyoid, and longus colli) and dorsal neck muscles (rectus capitis posterior major, obliquus capitis inferior, splenius capitis, and trapezius) were taken from 64 patients who underwent spondylodesis for cervical dysfunction of different etiologies. the muscle fibers were classified histochemically as type i, iia, iib, or iic (transitional or intermediate fibers) according to the ph lability of their myofibrillar atpase. signs of muscle fiber transformations were observed in all muscles investigated, as evidenced by an increased relative amount of type‐iic fibers. the transformations occurred independently of (a) the type of muscle (i.e., more “postural” or more “phasic”), (b) the sex and age of the patient, (c) the type of condition, and (d) the presence of additional neurological deficits. thus, the same pattern of muscular reaction was found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as in patients with soft‐tissue injuries of the neck (e.g., “whiplash injury”). in the ventral muscles and the obliquus capitis inferior, the occurrence of transformations correlated strongly with the duration of symptoms; in the ventral muscles the vast majority of transformations were encountered in patients with a shorter history of symptoms, whereas in the obliquus capitis inferior the reverse occurred. in the other dorsal muscles, no correlation with the duration of symptoms was found. muscles in which transformations had ceased displayed, on average, a significantly higher percentage of fast type‐iib fibers than were found in muscles with ongoing transformations. this strongly indicates that the transformations proceeded in the direction from “slow oxidative” to “fast glycolytic”.
oxidative stress is a major contributor to the secondary injury process after experimental traumatic brain injury (tbi). the importance of oxidative stress in the pathobiology of human tbi is largely unknown. the f(2)-isoprostane 8-iso-prostaglandin f(2α) (8-iso-pgf(2α)), synthesized in vivo through non-enzymatic free radical catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid, is a widely used biomarker of oxidative stress in multiple disease states, including tbi and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. our hypothesis is that harvesting of biomarkers directly in the injured brain by cerebral microdialysis (md) is advantageous because of its high spatial and temporal resolution compared to blood or cerebrospinal fluid sampling. the aim of this study was to test the feasibility of measuring 8-iso-pgf(2α) in md, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (vcsf), and plasma samples collected from patients with severe tbi, and to compare the md signals with md-glycerol, implicated as a biomarker of oxidative stress, as well as md-glutamate, a biomarker of excitotoxicity. six patients (4 men, 2 women) were included in the study, three of whom had a focal/mixed tbi, and three a diffuse axonal injury (dai). following the bedside analysis of routine md biomarkers (glucose, lactate:pyruvate ratio, glycerol, and glutamate), two 12-h md samples per day were used to analyze 8-iso-pgf(2α) from 24 h up to 8 days post-injury. the interstitial levels of 8-iso-pgf(2α) were markedly higher than the levels obtained from plasma and vcsf (p<0.05), supporting our hypothesis. the md-8-iso-pgf(2α) levels correlated strongly (p<0.05) with md-glycerol and md-glutamate, which are widely used biomarkers of membrane phospholipid degradation/oxidative stress and excitotoxicity, respectively. this study demonstrates the feasibility of analyzing 8-iso-pgf(2α) in md samples from the human brain. our results support a close relationship between oxidative stress and excitotoxicity following human tbi. md-8-iso-pgf(2α) in combination with md-glycerol may be useful biomarkers of oxidative stress in the neurointensive care setting.  mammalian cells express a transport system known as system xc−, which is an exchange agency specific for anionic forms of cystine and glutamate. system xc− activity is important to maintain both intracellular glutathione levels and the redox balance between cystine and cysteine in the extracellular milieu. we have shown that the cloned cdnas encoding the transporter for system xc− consist of two components, xct and the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen. in the present study, we have investigated the mrna distribution for these components in the mouse brain by in situ hybridization. the xct mrna was expressed in the area postrema, subfornical organ, habenular nucleus, hypothalamic area, and ependymal cells of the lateral wall of the third ventricle in the adult mouse brain. a strong signal was also detected in the meninges in both adult and fetal mouse brains. the mrna expression of the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen was detected in a more broad area, including all of the regions in which xct mrna was detected. these data are compatible with our biochemical evidence that xct functions in combination with the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen to elicit system xc− activity. the expression of system xc− in meninges and some circumventricular organs may suggest that this transporter contributes to the maintenance of the redox state (i.e., cysteine/cystine ratio) in the csf.
information security has become a central societal concern over the past two decades. few studies have examined the information security research domain, and no literature has been found that has applied an objective, quantitative methodology. the central aim of the current research was to quantitatively describe the profile and evolution of the information security specialty. bibliometric data extracted from 74,021 scopus research records published from 1965 to 2015 were examined using impact and productivity measures as well as co-word and domain visualization techniques. this scientometric study presents a comprehensive view of the information security specialty from several perspectives (e.g., temporal, seminal papers, institutions, sources, authors). after a long and steady period of growth (1965–2004), an exponential publication output occurred between 2005 and 2010. among all the countries involved in information security research, the united states and china had the greatest impact, and china has surpassed the united states in terms of productivity. information security as a specialty is largely populated by publications from the technical fields of computer science and engineering. several research themes were found throughout the decades (e.g., cryptography and information security management and administration), and emergent research subspecialties appeared in later decades (e.g., intrusion detection, medical data security, steganography, wireless security). this study reduces the complexity of the specialty to controllable terms, supplies objective data for science policy making, identifies the salient bibliographic units, and uncovers growth patterns. it also serves as an information retrieval tool to identify important papers, authors, and institutions.  despite increasing awareness of the need to trace the trajectory of innovation system research, so far little attention has been given to quantitative depiction of the evolution of this fast-moving research field. this paper uses citespace to demonstrate visually intellectual structures and developments. the study uses citation analysis to detect and visualize disciplinary distributions, keyword co-word networks and journal cocitation networks, highly cited references, as well as highly cited authors to identify intellectual turning points, pivotal points and emerging trends, in innovation systems system research from 1975 to 2012.
backgroundthe purpose of our study was to determine whether abnormalities of increased or decreased fundus autofluorescence (faf) are associated with local changes in macular pigment (mp) optical density in patients with age-related maculopathy (arm) and macular degeneration (armd).methodsfaf imaging and mp measurement was performed through dilated pupils using a modified confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (hra, heidelberg engineering, germany) according to a standard protocol. two-wavelength autofluorescence method was employed for determination of local macular pigment optical density (lmpod). image analysis and measurement of lmpod at the area of altered faf was performed using heidelberg eye explorer software. mean values of lmpod at the site of faf abnormality were compared to an adjacent location with normal background faf of the same image.resultssixty-three eyes of 63 patients (28 male, 35 female, mean age 75.8 ± 8.8 years) were included in this analysis. group 1 comprised 31 cases with focal increased faf. mean lmpod in the area of increased faf was 0.073 ± 0.083 compared to 0.075 ± 0.074 in the adjacent area of normal faf. group 2 comprised 32 cases of focal decreased faf. mean lmpod in the area of decreased faf was –0.004 ± 0.088 compared 0.053 ± 0.075 in the adjacent area of normal faf. the site of increased faf showed no significant difference in lmpod (p = 0.927) compared to adjacent areas of normal faf, while areas of decreased faf revealed significantly lower lmpod (p = 0.001) compared to adjacent areas of normal faf.conclusionsfocal increases of faf due to arm or armd did not lead to change in lmpod. presumably, retinal layers containing mp are unaffected by these processes. for lesions exhibiting focal decreased faf, a reduction of lmpod cannot be excluded. further studies are needed to investigate mp in the course of disease.  purpose to image and quantify the spatial distribution of fundus autofluorescence in normal subjects, to determine its age dependence, and to document the deviation from normal in patients with age-related macular disease.   methods using a confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (clso), the intensity and spatial distribution of fundus autofluorescence was studied in 33 normal subjects, 97 eyes with drusen only, and 111 eyes with visual loss caused by age-related macular disease.   results fundus autofluorescence intensity in normal subjects was highest at the posterior pole and dipped at the fovea. autofluorescence increased with age at the posterior pole. fundus in eyes with age-related maculopathy showed localized high autofluorescence that did not correspond with drusen. linear pigmentation at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (rpe), whether detached or flat, fluoresced brightly, whereas plaques of melanin did not. areas of low and high levels of autofluorescence were seen in lesions containing choroidal new vessels. in areas of geographic atrophy, autofluorescence was low.   conclusions the spatial distribution of background fundus autofluorescence and the correlation of autofluorescence with age in normal subjects imply that autofluorescence is derived from lipofuscin at the level of the rpe. focal accumulation of autofluorescent material occurs at the level of the rpe in patients with drusen, but the drusen do not show marked increases in autofluorescence. it is likely that melanolipofuscin accounts for the high levels of autofluorescence, corresponding to linear pigmentation at the level of the rpe. low-intensity autofluorescence occurs in the presence of retinal photoreceptor loss, and variable levels over disciform lesions probably relate to variations in metabolic activity of the rpe.
in the present work we investigate how the state of credit markets affects the impact of fiscal policies. we estimate a threshold vector autoregression (tvar) model on u.s quarterly data for the period 1984-2010. we employ the spread between baarated corporate bond yield and 10-year treasury constant maturity rate as a proxy for credit conditions. we find that the response of output to fiscal policy shocks is stronger and more persistent when the economy is in the “tight” credit regime. fiscal multipliers are significantly different in the two regimes: they are abundantly and persistently higher than one when firms face increasing financing costs, whereas they are feebler and often lower than one in the “normal” credit regime. the results appear to be robust to different model specifications, fiscal foresight, alternative threshold variables, different measure of variables and sample periods. jel codes: j32, e32, e44, e62  the problem of testing for linearity and the number of regimes in the context of self-exciting threshold autoregressive (setar) models is reviewed. we describe least-squares methods of estimation and inference. the primary complication is that the testing problem is non-standard, due to the presence of parameters which are only defined under the alternative, so the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics is non-standard. simulation methods to calculate asymptotic and bootstrap distributions are presented. as the sampling distributions are quite sensitive to conditional heteroskedasticity in the error, careful modeling of the conditional variance is necessary for accurate inference on the conditional mean. we illustrate these methods with two applications--annual sunspot means and monthly u.s. industrial production. we find that annual sunspots and monthly industrial production are setar(2) processes. copyright 1999 by blackwell publishers ltd
callogenesis, somatic embryogenesis, and regeneration were obtained from tissues of unfertilized ovaries of sweet orange (citrus sinensis osbeck.) cv. tobias. the influence of two modified basal media, woody plant medium (wpm) and n6 medium, to induce callus formation from pistils was determined. overall, high frequencies of callogenesis were observed when either medium was used. however, initial culture of explants in wpm medium followed by transfer of callus to n6 medium resulted in higher frequency of callus induction (of 2.30 callus per explant that were larger than 0.5 cm in size), and of subsequent development of embryogenic callus (10%). a total of 125 somatic embryos were obtained. after 6 months of culture, 72% of somatic embryos germinated into plantlets. these plantlets were subsequently micrografted in vitro, and then acclimatized. ploidy of these plants were determined using flow cytometry and traps molecular markers were used to confirm their maternal origin.  an improvement of the protocol for haploid induction through anther culture of citrus clementina hort. ex tan. cv. nules was achieved following the evaluation of a number of the factors affecting androgenesis. the influence of thidiazuron (tdz) and three temperature pre-treatments (4°c, 25°c, 32°c) on the floral buds with respect to anther culture of c. clementina hort. ex tan., cv. nules was investigated. an increased embryoid production was induced in the medium supplemented with tdz. pre-treatment temperatures of 4°c and 25°c were more favorable for embryo production than 32°c. regeneration of androgenic haploid plantlets from cv. sra 63 of c. clementina is reported here for the first time.
in our previous work we showed that ngal, a protein involved in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation, is overexpressed in human breast cancer (bc) and predicts poor prognosis. in neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nact) pathological complete response (pcr) is a predictor for outcome. the aim of this study was to evaluate ngal as a predictor of response to nact and to validate ngal as a prognostic factor for clinical outcome in patients with primary bc. immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarrays from 652 core biopsies from bc patients, who underwent nact in the gepartrio trial. ngal expression and intensity was evaluated separately. ngal was detected in 42.2% of the breast carcinomas in the cytoplasm. ngal expression correlated with negative hormone receptor (hr) status, but not with other baseline parameters. ngal expression did not correlate with pcr in the full population, however, ngal expression and staining intensity were significantly associated with higher pcr rates in patients with positive hr status. in addition, strong ngal expression correlated with higher pcr rates in node negative patients, patients with histological grade 1 or 2 tumors and a tumor size <40 mm. in univariate survival analysis, positive ngal expression and strong staining intensity correlated with decreased disease-free survival (dfs) in the entire cohort and different subgroups, including hr positive patients. similar correlations were found for intense staining and decreased overall survival (os). in multivariate analysis, ngal expression remained an independent prognostic factor for dfs. the results show that in low-risk subgroups, ngal was found to be a predictive marker for pcr after nact. furthermore, ngal could be validated as an independent prognostic factor for decreased dfs in primary human bc.  neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (ngal) is a small, secreted glycoprotein with proposed functions in cell proliferation, survival and morphogenesis. ngal is expressed in a variety of tumor types including breast carcinomas, but it is not known whether ngal contributes directly to breast cancer progression. this study examines the relationship between ngal expression in breast carcinomas and established clinical prognostic markers as well as clinical outcome. using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing well characterized tumor samples from 207 breast cancer patients, ngal was detected in 68 breast carcinomas in a cytoplasmic location. ngal expression correlated strongly with negative steroid receptor status, her-2/neu overexpression, poor histologic grade, the presence of lymph node metastases and a high ki-67 proliferation index. in univariate survival analysis, ngal expression was associated with decreased disease-specific survival and decreased disease-free survival in the entire cohort. in multivariate analysis, ngal remained an independent prognostic marker for disease-free survival. in a subset of patients with estrogen receptor positive tumors, ngal was significantly associated with decreased disease-free survival. the results show that ngal expression is a predictor of poor prognosis in primary human breast cancer and suggest that ngal detection may provide information for risk assessment and identify a subset of patients requiring more aggressive adjuvant therapy.
to help family caregivers (fcs), social workers need to understand the complexity of fc’s experiences and challenges. for this systematic review, several relevant, multidisciplinary electronic databases were searched. of 1,643 titles identified, 108 articles met the inclusion criteria and are included in this review. various experiences, symptoms, and burden related to caregiving responsibilities are described and discussed. the understanding evolving from this study about the fc’s own health risk, caregiver burden, and experiences over time can enhance a social worker’s awareness of an fc’s challenging situation and the potential impact this has on the fc’s ability to provide care to the patient.  the current study examined whether adult children of recently diagnosed breast cancer patients experience heightened general and major stressor-related distress, and identified a potential mediator between these two forms of distress. unique from other stress studies, the current study proposed a novel intrapsychic construct, the extent to which one understands and recognizes his or her thoughts and feelings related to a major stressor, for which we coined the term cognitive and emotional coherence. albeit preliminary, findings supported study hypotheses and argue that this construct may represent an important mediator of distress as well as a pivotal target for psychosocial intervention.
background arab americans exhibit higher rates of hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors relative to national averages. while research suggests some minorities may exhibit increased cardiovascular reactivity (cvr) to, and slowed recovery from, stress compared to whites, which may represent a risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular disease, this has not been studied in arab americans. this study examined differences between arab americans and whites in cognitive appraisal, and blood pressure and heart rate (hr) reactivity and recovery to laboratory stressors.   methods the undergraduate sample included 27 arab americans (16 female) and 27 gender matched whites. eligible participants completed two stressful laboratory tasks (mental arithmetic [ma] and stress-recall [sr]). cognitive appraisals were assessed for each task, and physiological data were collected during baseline, each laboratory task, and recovery. ethnicity differences in baseline cardiovascular values and cognitive appraisals were examined with t-tests, while differences in cvr and recovery were tested with ancova, controlling for initial values.   results arab americans showed lower baseline systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure than whites. arab americans also reported greater threat and stress associated with ma, and greater threat for sr. no cvr differences were observed during ma; however during and after sr, arab americans evidenced lesser systolic and diastolic blood pressure reactivity and lesser hr recovery compared to whites.   conclusions overall, arab americans showed lesser reactivity than whites, but also exhibited slower hr recovery. these results may be attributable to physiological habituation to chronic stress associated with minority status.  problem/condition the u.s. population continues to diversify, and certain racial/ethnic minorities are growing at a substantially more rapid pace than the majority population. limited large-scale population-based surveys and surveillance systems are designed to monitor the health status of minority populations. the racial and ethnic approaches to community health (reach) 2010 risk factor survey is conducted annually in minority communities in the united states. the survey focuses on four minority populations (blacks, hispanics, asians/pacific islanders [a/pis], and american indians).   reporting period covered 2001-2002.   description of system telephone (n = 18 communities) and face-to-face (n = 3 communities) interviews were conducted in 21 communities located in 14 states (alabama, california, georgia, illinois, louisiana, massachusetts, michigan, new york, north carolina, oklahoma, south carolina, tennessee, texas, and washington). an average of 1,000 minority residents aged >/=18 years in each community was sampled. interviews were administered in english, spanish, vietnamese, khmer, or mandarin chinese. the median response rate for household screenings was 74.0% for households that were reached and 72.0% for family members interviewed. the self-reported data from the community were compared with data derived from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system (brfss) for the metropolitan/micropolitan statistical area (mmsa) or the state where the community was located and compared with national estimates from brfss.   results reported education level and household income were markedly lower in minority communities than the general population living in the comparison mmsa or state. more minorities reported being in fair or poor health, but they did not see a doctor because of the cost. substantial variations were observed in the prevalence of health-risk factors and selected chronic conditions among minority populations and in communities within the same racial/ethnic minority. the median prevalence of obesity among a/pi men and women was 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively, whereas 39.2% and 37.5% of american indian men and women were obese, respectively. cigarette smoking was common in american indian communities, with a median of 42.2% for men and 36.7% for women. compared with the national level, fewer minority adults reported eating >/=5 fruits and vegetables daily and met recommendations for moderate or vigorous leisure-time physical activity. american indian communities had a high prevalence of self-reported cardiovascular disease, hypertension, high blood cholesterol, and diabetes. a high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes was also observed in black communities (32.0% and 10.9%, respectively, for men and 40.4% and 14.3%, respectively, for women). compared with the general u.s. population, a substantially lower percentage of hispanics and a/pis had reported receiving preventive services (e.g., cholesterol screenings; glycosylated hemoglobin tests and foot examinations for patients with diabetes; mammograms and papanicolaou smear tests; and vaccination for influenza and pneumonia among adults aged >/=65 years).   interpretation data from the reach 2010 risk factor survey demonstrate that residents in the minority communities bear greater risks for disease compared with the general population living in the same mmsa or state. substantial variations in the prevalence of risk factors, chronic conditions, and use of preventive services among different minority populations and in communities within the same racial/ethnic population provide opportunities for public health interventions. these variations also indicate that different racial/ethnic populations and different communities should have different priorities in eliminating health disparities.   public health actions the continuous surveillance of health status in minority communities is necessary so that culturally sensitive prevention strategies can be tailored to these communities and program interventions evaluated.
this paper analyzes the impacts of consumer subsidies in the global market for solar panels. consumer subsidies can have at least two effects. first, subsidies shift out demand and increase equilibrium quantities, holding production costs fixed. second, subsidies may encourage firms to innovate to reduce their costs over time. i quantify these impacts by estimating a dynamic structural model of competition among solar panel manufacturers. the model produces two key insights. first, ignoring long-run supply responses can generate biased estimates of the effects of government policy. without accounting for induced innovation, subsidies increased global solar adoption 49 percent over the period 2010-2015, leading to over $15 billion in external social benefits. accounting for induced innovation increases the external benefits by at least 22 percent. second, decentralized government intervention in a global market is inefficient. a subsidy in one country increases long-run solar adoption elsewhere because it increases investment in innovation by international firms. this spillover underscores the need for international coordination to address climate change. ∗i am grateful to joe aldy, myrto kalouptsidi, ariel pakes, rob stavins, and jim stock for their invaluable guidance and support. i thank jonathan baker, evan herrnstadt, robin lee, jing li, alex mackay, marc melitz, mark shepard, sam stolper, rich sweeney, elie tamer, and participants in the harvard industrial organization and environmental economics lunches and workshops, as well as the northeast workshop on energy policy and environmental economics, for helpful comments and conversations. the data used in this paper were obtained through a data use agreement with ihs markit. i gratefully acknowledge support from u.s. epa star fellowship assistance agreement no. fp-91769401-0 and harvard’s joseph crump fellowship. †harvard university. email: gerarden@fas.harvard.edu. website: scholar.harvard.edu/gerarden.  this paper estimates demand for residential solar photovoltaic (pv) systems using a new approach to address three empirical challenges that often arise with count data: excess zeros, unobserved heterogeneity, and endogeneity of price. our results imply a price elasticity of demand for solar pv systems of −0.65. counterfactual policy simulations indicate that reducing state financial incentives in half would have led to 9% fewer new installations in connecticut in 2014. calculations suggest a subsidy program cost of $364/tco2 assuming solar displaces natural gas. our poisson hurdle approach holds promise for modeling the demand for many new technologies.
a smile may convey different communicative intentions depending on subtle characteristics of the facial expression. moreover, during an interaction, the expression of smile impacts on the observer's perception of both the social stance of the speaker and of the content of the talk. in this paper, we describe a perceptual study where we explore the effects of virtual characters displaying different types of smiles (namely politeness and amusement) when speaking on the user's perception. based on the collected data, a model to automatically compute the user's potential perception of the virtual character's social stance depending on its smiling behavior and on its gender has been proposed.  social psychological research demonstrates that the same behavior might lead to different evaluations depending on whether it is shown by a man or a woman. with a view to design decisions with regard to virtual humans it is relevant to test whether this pattern also applies to gendered virtual humans. in a 2×2 between subjects experiment we manipulated the rapport agent's gaze behavior and its gender in order to test whether especially female agents are evaluated more negatively when they do not show gender specific immediacy behavior and avoid gazing at the interaction partner. instead of this interaction effect we found two main effects: gaze avoidance was evaluated negatively and female agents were rated more positively than male agents.
local hyperthermia has been widely used as physical therapy for a number of diseases such as inflammatory osteoarticular disorders, tendinitis, and muscle injury. local hyperthermia is clinically applied to improve blood and lymphatic flow to decrease swelling of tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle). as for muscle repair following injury, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of hyperthermia-induced muscle repair are unknown. in this study, we investigated the direct effects of continuous heat stress on the differentiation of cultured mammalian myoblasts. compared with control cultures grown at 37 degrees c, incubation at 39 degrees c (continuous mild heat stress; cmhs) enhanced myotube diameter, whereas myotubes were poorly formed at 41 degrees c by primary human skeletal muscle culture cells, human skeletal muscle myoblasts (hsmms), and c2c12 mouse myoblasts. in hsmms and c2c12 cells exposed to cmhs, mrna and protein levels of myosin heavy chain (myhc) type i were increased compared with the control cultures. the mrna level of myhc iix was unaltered in hsmms and decreased in c2c12 cells, compared with cells that were not exposed to heat stress. these results indicated a fast-to-slow fiber-type shift in myoblasts. we also examined upstream signals that might be responsible for the fast-to-slow shift of fiber types. cmhs enhanced the mrna and protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (pgc)-1alpha in hsmms and c2c12 cells but not the activities of mapks (erk1/2 and p38 mapk) in hsmms and c2c12 cells. these data suggest that cmhs induces a fast-to-slow fiber-type shift of mammalian myoblasts through pgc-1alpha.  satellite cell proliferation was assessed in low-frequency-stimulated hypothyroid rat fast-twitch muscle by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (brdu) labeling and subsequent staining of labeled muscle nuclei, and by staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna). brdu labeling and pcna staining were highly correlated and increased approximately fourfold at 5 days of stimulation, decayed thereafter, but remained elevated over control in 10- and 20-day stimulated muscles. myogenin mrna was approximately 4-fold elevated at 5 days and 1.5-fold at 10 days. staining for myogenin protein yielded results similar to that for pcna and brdu. furthermore, a detailed examination of the pattern of myogenin staining revealed that the number of myogenin-positive nuclei was elevated in the fast pure iib fiber population at 5 and 10 days of chronic low-frequency stimulation. by 20 days, myogenin staining was observed in transforming fast fibers that coexpressed embryonic and adult myosin heavy chain isoforms. in the slower fiber populations (i.e., iia and i), myogenin-positive transforming fibers that coexpressed embryonic myosin heavy chain, appeared already at 5 days. thus the satellite cell progeny on slower fibers seemed to proliferate less and to fuse earlier to their associated fibers than the satellite cell progeny on fast fibers. we suggest that the increase in muscle nuclei of the fast fibers might be a prerequisite for fast-to-slow fiber type transitions.
abstract the basal ganglia have traditionally been associated with motor control functions and this view has prevailed since the late nineteenth century. recent experimental studies suggest that this neuroanatomical system is also critically involved in motor learning. in the present study, motor learning/transfer capabilities were compared between patients with parkinson’s disease and a group of normal elderly people. subjects practiced a bimanual coordination task that required continuous flexion-extension movements in the transverse plane with a 90° phase offset between the forearms. during acquisition, augmented visual feedback of the relative motions was provided in real time. the findings revealed improvements in the bimanual coordination pattern across practice in both groups when the augmented concurrent feedback was present. however, when transferred to performance conditions in which the augmented information was withheld, performance deteriorated (relative to the augmented condition) and this effect was more prevalent in the parkinson patients. more specifically, no improvement in interlimb coordination was observed under nonaugmented feedback conditions across practice. instead, a drift toward the preferred in-phase and anti-phase coordination patterns was evident. the present findings suggest that parkinson patients can improve their performance on a new motor task, but they remain strongly dependent on augmented visual information to guide these newly acquired movements. the apparent adoption of a closed-loop control mode is accompanied with decreases in movement speed in order to use the feedback to ensure accuracy. when the augmented feedback is withheld and the movement pattern is to be controlled by means of intrinsic information feedback sources, performance is severely hampered. the findings are hypothesized to indicate that learning/transfer is affected in parkinson patients who apparently prefer some constancy in the environmental contingencies under which practice takes place. the present findings are consistent with the notion that the basal ganglia form a critical neuroanatomical substrate for motor learning.  normal voluntary movements are considered to be of two kinds, or to involve two components, (i) a ballistic or "open-loop" type, which are preprogrammed and executed without reference to current sensory information and (ii) a corrective or "closed-loop" type, whose course or termination are regulated by such information. in a previous paper it was suggested that parkinsonism disrupted the first kind of movement, but intention tremor did not. in the present paper three experiments designed to test this hypothesis are described. subjects were tested on an acquisition-tracking task using an oscilloscope display and joystick control, and measurements were made of the duration, velocity and error of their initial movements to acquire the target. parkinsonian movements were found to be considerably different from normal in that (a) most movements by this group lasted longer than the reaction time for their initiation, as if including some secondary correction in their execution, (b) the rate of movement was not varied for different amplitudes (so keeping the duration fairly constant) as in normal subjects, but rather movements of all amplitudes were made at a constant slow rate, so that duration increased markedly with the larger steps, (c) error increased disproportionately as the velocity of movement increased; in particular any movements completed in one reaction time or less tended to be wildly inaccurate, (d) removing either the target or the response marker from the screen at the beginning of a movement had a significant effect, making it shorter in duration and smaller in amplitude than those usually produced with both markers visible all the time. parkinsonian subjects showed no improvement in performance with repeated attempts at one movement over a whole sequence, so their deficit appears to be stable even after practice on a known fixed task. these results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that parkinsonism interferes with the generation of accurate ballistic action which are characteristic of normal skilled movement. tremor subjects in general resembled normal control subjects in their initial acquistion movements, but their accuracy was less with the larger steps.
mangroves are traditionally considered to provide important nutrition to tropical estuarine consumers. however, there is still controversy about this, and the extent and importance of these inputs are largely unquantified. in particular, there is no information for food webs of small estuaries that dominate wet–dry tropical coasts, where freshwater inflow is intermittent, leading to highly seasonal inputs of nutrients from terrestrial systems. since the relative importance of the different sources depends on the type and extent of different habitats and on hydrological and topographic conditions, results from other regions/type of systems cannot be extrapolated to these estuaries. here, δ13c is used to determine the importance of mangrove-derived carbon for penaeus merguiensis (detritivore; shrimp), ambassis vachellii (planktivore; fish), and leiognathus equulus (benthivore; fish) from six small wet–dry tropical estuaries that differ in mangrove (c3) cover and in type of terrestrial vegetation adjacent to the estuary. bayesian mixing models confirmed that mangrove material was important to consumers in all estuaries. there was a gradient in this importance that agreed with the extent of mangrove forests in the estuaries, as c3 sources were the most important contributors to animals from the three estuaries with the greatest (>40 %) mangrove cover. there was also evidence of incorporation of c3 material for the three estuaries with lower (<30 %) mangrove cover. since these latter estuaries had no adjacent terrestrial c3 forests, the detected c3 influence can only be of mangrove origin. this shows that mangroves are important contributors to these food webs, underlining the importance of mangroves in supporting estuarine nursery ground value and fisheries productivity.  background stable isotope analysis is increasingly being utilised across broad areas of ecology and biology. key to much of this work is the use of mixing models to estimate the proportion of sources contributing to a mixture such as in diet estimation. methodology by accurately reflecting natural variation and uncertainty to generate robust probability estimates of source proportions, the application of bayesian methods to stable isotope mixing models promises to enable researchers to address an array of new questions, and approach current questions with greater insight and honesty. conclusions we outline a framework that builds on recently published bayesian isotopic mixing models and present a new open source r package, siar. the formulation in r will allow for continued and rapid development of this core model into an all-encompassing single analysis suite for stable isotope research.
abstract in this paper we address the problem of optimizing the time window controller (tw-controller). this controller was first introduced in 2001 as a supervising mechanism for distributed scheduling of multiclass queuing networks with the objective of stabilizing those networks. it was then also shown that the tw-controller possesses the ability to improve performance of stable networks. we revise the controller and present a series of formal results concerning its main properties and features. then, we propose to use simulated annealing on a simulation-based optimization approach and present numerical results that demonstrate the controller's ability to improve performance over any given scheduling policy.  introduction to discrete event systems is a comprehensive introduction to the field of discrete event systems, offering a breadth of coverage that makes the material accessible to readers of varied backgrounds. the book emphasizes a unified modeling framework that transcends specific application areas, linking the following topics in a coherent manner: language and automata theory, supervisory control, petri net theory, markov chains and queuing theory, discrete-event simulation, and concurrent estimation techniques. this edition includes recent research results pertaining to the diagnosis of discrete event systems, decentralized supervisory control, and interval-based timed automata and hybrid automata models.
unlabelled the purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the link that has been established between stuttering and linguistic stress in adolescents and adults (the so-called stress effect) can also be observed in childhood stuttering. to account for confounding variables, both within-word position and grammatical class were measured, because these factors covary with linguistic stress. speech samples of 22 preschool children (mean time of 9 months since onset of stuttering) were analyzed. the relative stress of each syllable was rated and syllables were categorized into long and short stressed, unstressed, and intermediately stressed syllables. results showed that 97.8% of stuttering events occurred on first syllables of words and 76.5% on the first sound of syllables, that means a clear word-initial effect. stuttering frequency on first syllables of function words was 16.9% and significantly higher than the frequency of stuttered first syllables of content words (11.5%). in function words short stressed syllables and intermediately stressed syllables were stuttered more often than unstressed syllables. the analysis for individual disfluency types revealed that, for function words, stuttering on short stressed syllables was associated with prolongations and syllable repetitions. however, in intermediately stressed syllables stuttering coincided most often with one-syllable word repetitions. this differentiation of the stress effect may suggest different causal mechanisms underlying these disfluency types.   educational objectives the reader will learn about and be able to: (1) describe how within-word position, grammatical class, and linguistic stress effect stuttering frequency in preschool children who stutter; (2) explain how the occurrence of individual disfluency types depends on linguistic stress; (3) discuss how patterns of adults and preschool children who stutter differ in regard to these aspects.  thirteen invited papers from a two-day discussion session held in september 1999 are collected in this issue of philosophical transactions of the royal society. all the papers have been revised and edited, and the discussion following the presentation of each paper has been transcribed and appended. in addition, the editors have contributed a paper-length introduction. the contents are as follows:
planar cell polarity (pcp) is a ubiquitous property of animal tissues and is essential for morphogenesis and homeostasis. in most cases, this fundamental property is governed by a deeply conserved set of ‘core pcp’ proteins, which includes the transmembrane proteins van gogh-like (vangl) and frizzled (fzd), as well as the cytoplasmic effectors prickle (pk) and dishevelled (dvl). asymmetric localization of these proteins is thought to be central to their function, and understanding the dynamics of these proteins is an important challenge in developmental biology. among the processes that are organized by the core pcp proteins is the directional beating of cilia, such as those in the vertebrate node, airway and brain. here, we exploit the live imaging capabilities of xenopus to chart the progressive asymmetric localization of fluorescent reporters of dvl1, pk2 and vangl1 in a planar polarized ciliated epithelium. using this system, we also characterize the influence of pk2 on the asymmetric dynamics of vangl1 at the cell cortex, and we define regions of pk2 that control its own localization and those impacting vangl1. finally, our data reveal a striking uncoupling of vangl1 and dvl1 asymmetry. this study advances our understanding of conserved pcp protein functions and also establishes a rapid, tractable platform to facilitate future in vivo studies of vertebrate pcp protein dynamics. summary: live imaging in xenopus reveals that pk2, a cytoplasmic effector of the pcp pathway, controls the directional ciliary beating in multiciliated cells by regulating vangl1 dynamics at the cell cortex.  planar polarity decisions in the wing of drosophila involve the assembly of asymmetric protein complexes containing the conserved receptor frizzled. in this study, we analyse the role of the van gogh/strabismus gene in the formation of these complexes and cell polarisation. we find that the strabismus protein becomes asymmetrically localised to the proximal edge of cells. in the absence of strabismus activity, the planar polarity proteins dishevelled and prickle are mislocalised in the cell. we show that strabismus binds directly to dishevelled and prickle and is able to recruit them to membranes. furthermore, we demonstrate that the putative pdz-binding motif at the c terminus of strabismus is not required for its function. we propose a two-step model for assembly of frizzledcontaining asymmetric protein complexes at cell boundaries. first, strabismus acts together with frizzled and the atypical cadherin flamingo to mediate apicolateral recruitment of planar polarity proteins including dishevelled and prickle. in the second phase, dishevelled and prickle are required for these proteins to become asymmetrically distributed on the proximodistal axis.
the regular monitoring of physical fitness and sport-specific performance is important in elite sports to increase the likelihood of success in competition. this study aimed to systematically review and to critically appraise the methodological quality, validation data, and feasibility of the sport-specific performance assessment in olympic combat sports like amateur boxing, fencing, judo, karate, taekwondo, and wrestling. a systematic search was conducted in the electronic databases pubmed, google-scholar, and science-direct up to october 2017. studies in combat sports were included that reported validation data (e.g., reliability, validity, sensitivity) of sport-specific tests. overall, 39 studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. the majority of studies (74%) contained sample sizes <30 subjects. nearly, 1/3 of the reviewed studies lacked a sufficient description (e.g., anthropometrics, age, expertise level) of the included participants. seventy-two percent of studies did not sufficiently report inclusion/exclusion criteria of their participants. in 62% of the included studies, the description and/or inclusion of a familiarization session (s) was either incomplete or not existent. sixty-percent of studies did not report any details about the stability of testing conditions. approximately half of the studies examined reliability measures of the included sport-specific tests (intraclass correlation coefficient [icc] = 0.43–1.00). content validity was addressed in all included studies, criterion validity (only the concurrent aspect of it) in approximately half of the studies with correlation coefficients ranging from r = −0.41 to 0.90. construct validity was reported in 31% of the included studies and predictive validity in only one. test sensitivity was addressed in 13% of the included studies. the majority of studies (64%) ignored and/or provided incomplete information on test feasibility and methodological limitations of the sport-specific test. in 28% of the included studies, insufficient information or a complete lack of information was provided in the respective field of the test application. several methodological gaps exist in studies that used sport-specific performance tests in olympic combat sports. additional research should adopt more rigorous validation procedures in the application and description of sport-specific performance tests in olympic combat sports.  performance testing is one of the most common and important measures used in sports science and physiology. performance tests allow for a controlled simulation of sports and exercise performance for research or applied science purposes. there are three factors that contribute to a good performance test: (i) validity; (ii) reliability; and (iii) sensitivity. a valid protocol is one that resembles the performance that is being simulated as closely as possible. when investigating race-type events, the two most common protocols are time to exhaustion and time trials. time trials have greater validity than time to exhaustion because they provide a good physiological simulation of actual performance and correlate with actual performance. sports such as soccer are more difficult to simulate. while shuttle-running protocols such as the loughborough intermittent shuttle test may simulate physiology of soccer using time to exhaustion or distance covered, it is not a valid measure of soccer performance. there is a need to include measures of skill in such protocols. reliability is the variation of a protocol. research has shown that time-to-exhaustion protocols have a coefficient of variation (cv) of >10%, whereas time trials are more reliable as they have been shown to have a cv of <5%. a sensitive protocol is one that is able to detect small, but important, changes in performance. the difference between finishing first and second in a sporting event is <1%. therefore, it is important to be able to detect small changes with performance protocols. a quantitative value of sensitivity may be accomplished through the signal : noise ratio, where the signal is the percentage improvement in performance and the noise is the cv.
the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of serum-starvation, contact-inhibition and roscovitine treatments on cell-cycle synchronization at the g0/g1 stage of ear skin fibroblasts isolated from transgenic cloned cattle. the developmental competence of re-cloned embryos was also examined. our results showed that the proportion of g0/g1 cells from the serum-starved group at 3, 4 or 5 days was significantly higher compared with 1 or 2 days only (91.5, 91.7 and 93.5% versus 90.1 and 88.8%, respectively, p < 0.05); whilst there was no statistical difference among cells at 3, 4 or 5 days. for roscovitine-treated cells, the proportion of g0/g1 cells at 2, 3, 4 or 5 days was significantly higher than those treated for 1 day only (91.1, 90.1, 89.4 and 91.3% versus 86.51%, respectively, p < 0.05). the proportion of contact-inhibited g0/g1 cells rose significantly with treatment time, but was similar at 3, 4 and 5 days (89.4, 90.4, 91.4, 91.6 and 92.1%, respectively, p < 0.05). the efficiency of obtaining g0/g1 phase cells was lower when roscovitine treatment was employed to synchronize the cell cycle compared with the serum-starvation and contact-inhibition methods (89.7 versus 91.1% and 91.0%, p < 0.05). moreover, obvious differences were observed in the rate of fused couplets and blastocysts (89.88 +/- 2.70 versus 87.40 +/- 5.13; 44.10 +/- 8.62 versus 58.38 +/- 13.28, respectively, p < 0.05), when nuclear transfer embryos were reconstructed using donors cells that had been serum starved or contact inhibited for 3 days. our data indicate that 3 day treatment is feasible for harvesting sufficient g0/g1 cells to produce re-cloned transgenic bovine embryos, regardless of whether serum-starvation, contact-inhibition or roscovitine treatments are used as the synchronization methods.  synchronization of the cell cycle stages in g0/g1 phase is one of the key factors determining the success of nuclear transplantation. serum deprivation, contact inhibition and chemical inhibitors are widely used methods for this purpose. in this study, cell cycle stages of foetal fibroblasts and cumulus cells were determined using flow cytometry [fluorescence-activated cell scan (facs)]. foetal fibroblasts (in vitro cultured for 72-120 h) and fresh cumulus cells were analysed in experiment 1. fifty to 55% proliferating fibroblasts remained in g0/g1 phase compared with 78% in confluent culture (p <0.05). in contrast to foetal fibroblasts, fresh cumulus cells maintained 90% of the population in the g0/g1 stage. when serum was retrieved from the proliferating fibroblasts from day 1 to day 5 (experiment 2), proportions of g0/g1 cells increased from the initial ratio of 53 to 87% at day 4 of starvation, which was significantly higher than the non-starved proliferating cells (p <0.05). in experiment 3, fibroblasts were treated with aphidicolin (0.1 microg/ml, 6 h), demicolcine (0.5 microg/ml, 10 h), or a combination of these two chemicals to synchronize the cell cycle stages. surprisingly, no differences or significantly lower in the proportions of g0/g1)phase cells were detected (25-50%) compared with the uncontrolled growing cells (53%). these results suggested that fresh cumulus cells rest their cell cycle in g0/g1 stage. serum deprivation became effective in the first 24 h and reached the highest proportions during days 4-5 after deprivation. chemical synchronization of the cell cycle stage of rabbit foetal fibroblasts to g0/g1 phase appeared less effective compared to serum deprivation.
a variety of nervous system components such as medulla, pons, midbrain, cerebellum, basal ganglia, parietal, frontal and occipital lobes have role in eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (emdr) processes. the eye movement is done simultaneously for attracting client's attention to an external stimulus while concentrating on a certain internal subject. eye movement guided by therapist is the most common attention stimulus. the role of eye movement has been documented previously in relation with cognitive processing mechanisms. a series of systemic experiments have shown that the eyes’ spontaneous movement is associated with emotional and cognitive changes and results in decreased excitement, flexibility in attention, memory processing, and enhanced semantic recalling. eye movement also decreases the memory's image clarity and the accompanying excitement. by using emdr, we can reach some parts of memory which were inaccessible before and also emotionally intolerable. various researches emphasize on the effectiveness of emdr in treating and curing phobias, pains, and dependent personality disorders. consequently, due to the involvement of multiple neural system components, this palliative method of treatment can also help to rehabilitate the neuro-cognitive system.  the effects of saccadic bilateral (horizontal) eye movements on memory for a visual event narrative were investigated. in the study phase, participants were exposed to a set of pictures accompanied by a verbal commentary describing the events depicted in the pictures. next, the participants were asked either misleading or control questions about the depicted event and were then asked to engage in 30s of bilateral vs. vertical vs. no eye movements. finally, recognition memory was tested using the remember-know procedure. it was found that bilateral eye movements increased true memory for the event, increased recollection, and decreased the magnitude of the misinformation effect. the findings are discussed in terms of source monitoring, dual-process theories of memory and the potential neural foundations of such effects.
defects during chromosome replication in eukaryotes activate a signaling pathway called the s-phase checkpoint, which produces a multifaceted response that preserves genome integrity at stalled dna replication forks. work with budding yeast showed that the ‘alternative clamp loader’ known as ctf18-rfc acts by an unknown mechanism to activate the checkpoint kinase rad53, which then mediates much of the checkpoint response. here we show that budding yeast ctf18-rfc associates with dna polymerase epsilon, via an evolutionarily conserved ‘pol ϵ binding module’ in ctf18-rfc that is produced by interaction of the carboxyl terminus of ctf18 with the ctf8 and dcc1 subunits. mutations at the end of ctf18 disrupt the integrity of the pol ϵ binding module and block the s-phase checkpoint pathway, downstream of the mec1 kinase that is the budding yeast orthologue of mammalian atr. similar defects in checkpoint activation are produced by mutations that displace pol ϵ from the replisome. these findings indicate that the association of ctf18-rfc with pol ϵ at defective replication forks is a key step in activation of the s-phase checkpoint.  the s phase checkpoint pathway preserves genome stability by protecting defective dna replication forks, but the underlying mechanisms are still understood poorly. previous work with budding yeast suggested that the checkpoint kinases mec1 and rad53 might prevent collapse of the replisome when nucleotide concentrations are limiting, thereby allowing the subsequent resumption of dna synthesis. here we describe a direct analysis of replisome stability in budding yeast cells lacking checkpoint kinases, together with a high-resolution view of replisome progression across the genome. surprisingly, we find that the replisome is stably associated with dna replication forks following replication stress in the absence of mec1 or rad53. a component of the replicative dna helicase is phosphorylated within the replisome in a mec1-dependent manner upon replication stress, and our data indicate that checkpoint kinases control replisome function rather than stability, as part of a multifaceted response that allows cells to survive defects in chromosome replication.
in this work we analyze the distribution of the number of edges spanned by a single set and between two disjoint sets of vertices in the random regular graph model gn,d. we show it to be very similar to that of the binomial random graph model, g(n, p) with p = d n . as a direct consequence of our analysis, we show that the second eigenvalue of a d-regular graph where d = o( √ n) is w.h.p. at most o( √ d log d) by applying a recent result of bilu and linial [5]. next, using our results on the distribution of edges spanned by a single set of vertices, we show that for every fixed > 0 and d = o(n1/5), the chromatic number of gn,d is concentrated in two consecutive values with probability at least 1− for large enough values of n.  we prove that for every constant δ>0 the chromatic number of the random graphg(n, p) withp=n−1/2−δ is asymptotically almost surely concentrated in two consecutive values. this implies that for any β<1/2 and any integer valued functionr(n)≤o(nβ) there exists a functionp(n) such that the chromatic number ofg(n,p(n)) is preciselyr(n) asymptotically almost surely.
developing seeds are expected to be strongly defended against microbial attack. in keeping with this, only 26% of seeds of centaurea stoebe from its native and invaded ranges in eurasia and north america were infected with fungi, and 92.2% of those were infected with a single fungus per seed. even when developing seeds in flower heads were inoculated under conducive conditions for infection with 14 of these seed-infecting fungi, re-isolation of inoculants was only 16% overall, and again limited to the particular inoculant. environmental fungi (i.e. those not isolated from seed of c. stoebe) were present in control flower heads under conditions conducive to infection but they were never re-isolated from fully developed seeds in any experiments. when two or three seed isolates were co-inoculated to compete in flower heads, only one inoculant, and always the same one, was re-isolated from all matured seeds, regardless of maternal plant genotype. pcr-based detection methods confirmed that these fungal interactions were exclusionary rather than suppressive. in these strongly defended, developing seeds, we had expected the plant to control not only the overall level of infection but also the outcome of co-inoculations. consequences for the next plant generation of this exclusionary competition among seed-infecting fungi included effects on seedling emergence, growth and fecundity.  fungal endophytes are important in plant ecology and common in plants. we attempted to test cointroduction and host-jumping hypotheses on a community basis by comparing endophytes isolated from invasive spotted knapweed (centaurea stoebe, asteraceae) in its native and invaded ranges. of 92 combined, sequence-based haplotypes representing eight classes of fungi, 78 occurred in only one of the two ranges. in the native range of c. stoebe, one haplotype of alternaria alternata was clearly dominant, whereas in the invaded range, no haplotype was dominant. many haplotypes were closely related to one another and novel. for example, six putative, new species of botrytis were discovered as endophytes of c. stoebe, which has never been reported to have botrytis spp.. apparent differences between the two communities of endophytes were significant according to an analysis of similarity, but phylogenetic community structure did not differ significantly between the ranges. both host-jumping and cointroduction of fungal endophytes likely took place during the spotted knapweed invasion.
the immune receptor flagellin sensing2 (fls2) plays important roles in plant resistance to bacterial pathogens and is internalized from the plasma membrane via the endocytic pathway. ligand-activated fls2 traffics into late endosomal compartments, and this process requires the function of components distinct from nonactivated fls2 that recycles between early endosomes and the plasma membrane. the activity of surface receptors is location specific, dependent upon the dynamic membrane trafficking network and receptor-mediated endocytosis (rme). therefore, the spatio-temporal dynamics of rme are critical to receptor function. the plasma membrane receptor flagellin sensing2 (fls2) confers immunity against bacterial infection through perception of flagellin (flg22). following elicitation, fls2 is internalized into vesicles. to resolve fls2 trafficking, we exploited quantitative confocal imaging for colocalization studies and chemical interference. fls2 localizes to bona fide endosomes via two distinct endocytic trafficking routes depending on its activation status. fls2 receptors constitutively recycle in a brefeldin a (bfa)–sensitive manner, while flg22-activated receptors traffic via ara7/rab f2b– and ara6/rab f1–positive endosomes insensitive to bfa. fls2 endocytosis required a functional rab5 gtpase pathway as revealed by dominant-negative ara7/rab f2b. flg22-induced fls2 endosomal numbers were increased by concanamycin a treatment but reduced by wortmannin, indicating that activated fls2 receptors are targeted to late endosomes. rme inhibitors tyrphostin a23 and endosidin 1 altered but did not block induced fls2 endocytosis. additional inhibitor studies imply the involvement of the actin-myosin system in fls2 internalization and trafficking. altogether, we report a dynamic pattern of subcellular trafficking for fls2 and reveal a defined framework for ligand-dependent endocytosis of this receptor.  actin and myosin are components of plasmodesmata, the cytoplasmic channels between plant cells, but their role in regulating these channels is unclear. here, we investigated the role of myosin in regulating plasmodesmata in a well-studied, simple system comprising single filaments of cells which form stamen hairs in tradescantia virginiana flowers. effects of myosin inhibitors were assessed by analysing cell-to-cell movement of fluorescent tracers microinjected into treated cells. incubation in the myosin inhibitor, 2,3-butanedione monoxime (bdm) or injection of anti-myosin antibodies increased cell–cell transport of fluorescent dextrans, while treatment with the myosin inhibitor n-ethylmaleimide (nem) decreased cell–cell transport. pretreatment with the callose synthesis inhibitor, deoxy-d-glucose (ddg), enhanced transport induced by bdm treatment or injection of myosin antibodies but did not relieve nem-induced reduction in transport. in contrast to the myosin inhibitors, cell-to-cell transport was unaffected by treatment with the actin polymerisation inhibitor, latrunculin b, after controlling for callose synthesis with ddg. transport was increased following azide treatment, and reduced after injection of atp, as in previous studies. we propose that myosin detachment from actin, induced by bdm, opens t. virginiana plasmodesmata whereas the firm attachment of myosin to actin, promoted by nem, closes them.
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), via activation of trkb receptors, mediates vital physiological functions in the brain, ranging from neuronal survival to synaptic plasticity, and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. although transcriptional regulation of the bdnf gene (bdnf) has been extensively studied, much remains to be understood. we discovered a sequence within bdnf promoter 4 that binds the basic helix-loop-helix protein bhlhb2 and is a target for bhlhb2-mediated transcriptional repression. nmda receptor activation de-repressed promoter 4-mediated transcription and correlated with reduced occupancy of the promoter by bhlhb2 in cultured hippocampal neurons. bhlhb2 gene −/− mice showed increased hippocampal exon 4-specific bdnf mrna levels compared with +/+ littermates under basal and activity-dependent conditions. bhlhb2 knock-out mice also showed increased status epilepticus susceptibility, suggesting that bhlhb2 alters neuronal excitability. together, these results support a role for bhlhb2 as a new modulator of bdnf transcription and neuronal excitability.  drugs of abuse cause activation of the cyclic amp response element binding protein (creb) in the nucleus accumbens (nac). expression of active creb in rat nac medium spiny neurons (msns) increased their excitability, whereas dominant-negative creb had the opposite effect. decreasing excitability of nac msns in vivo by overexpression of potassium channels enhanced locomotor responses to cocaine, suggesting that the increased nac msn excitability caused by creb helped to limit behavioral sensitivity to cocaine.
objectivethe plan of information on acute respiratory infections in catalonia (pidirac) included the surveillance of severe hospitalized cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza (shclci) in 2009. the objective of this study was to determine the clinical, epidemiological and virological features of shclci recorded in 12 sentinel hospitals during five influenza seasons.resultsfrom a sample of shclci recorded during the 5 influenza epidemics seasons from 2010–2011 to 2014–2015, cases were confirmed by pcr and/or viral isolation in cell cultures from respiratory samples. a total of 1400 shclci were recorded, 33% required icu admission and 12% died. the median age of cases was 61 years (range 0–101 years); 70.5% were unvaccinated; 80.4% received antiviral treatment (in 79.6 and 24% of cases within 48 h after hospital admission and the onset of symptoms, respectively); influenza virus a [37.9% a (h1n1)pdm09, 29.3% a (h3n2)] was identified in 87.7% of cases. surveillance of shclci provides an estimate of the severity of seasonal influenza epidemics and the identification and characterization of at-risk groups in order to facilitate preventive measures such as vaccination and early antiviral treatment.  background the global burden of disease attributable to seasonal influenza virus in children is unknown. we aimed to estimate the global incidence of and mortality from lower respiratory infections associated with influenza in children younger than 5 years.   methods we estimated the incidence of influenza episodes, influenza-associated acute lower respiratory infections (alri), and influenza-associated severe alri in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age, with data from a systematic review of studies published between jan 1, 1995, and oct 31, 2010, and 16 unpublished population-based studies. we applied these incidence estimates to global population estimates for 2008 to calculate estimates for that year. we estimated possible bounds for influenza-associated alri mortality by combining incidence estimates with case fatality ratios from hospital-based reports and identifying studies with population-based data for influenza seasonality and monthly alri mortality.   findings we identified 43 suitable studies, with data for around 8 million children. we estimated that, in 2008, 90 million (95% ci 49-162 million) new cases of influenza (data from nine studies), 20 million (13-32 million) cases of influenza-associated alri (13% of all cases of paediatric alri; data from six studies), and 1 million (1-2 million) cases of influenza-associated severe alri (7% of cases of all severe paediatric alri; data from 39 studies) occurred worldwide in children younger than 5 years. we estimated there were 28,000-111,500 deaths in children younger than 5 years attributable to influenza-associated alri in 2008, with 99% of these deaths occurring in developing countries. incidence and mortality varied substantially from year to year in any one setting.   interpretation influenza is a common pathogen identified in children with alri and results in a substantial burden on health services worldwide. sufficient data to precisely estimate the role of influenza in childhood mortality from alri are not available.   funding who; bill & melinda gates foundation.
african american men who have sex with men have been disproportionately affected by the hiv epidemic in the united states and remain to this day one of the groups with highest hiv prevalence and incidence. our goal was to clarify the current state of hiv risk, sexual behaviors, and structural/network–network level factors that affect black msm’s population risk of hiv, enabling the formulation of targeted and up-to-date public health messages/campaigns directed at this vulnerable population. our approach maximized the use of local data through a process of synthesis and triangulation of multiple independent and overlapping sources of information that are sometimes separately published and often not examined side-by-side. among african american msm, we observed stable hiv incidence despite increases in reported individual risk behavior and stds. an increasing proportion of african american msm are reporting hiv testing in the past 6 months and seroadaptive behaviors, which may play a role in this observed decline in hiv among msm in san francisco, california. our analysis suggests that currently the hiv epidemic is stable among african american msm in san francisco. however, we suggest that the observed stability is due to factors prohibiting expansion of new infections rather than decreasing risks for hiv infection among african american msm.  understanding infectious disease dynamics and the effect on prevalence and incidence is crucial for public health policies. disease incidence and prevalence are typically not observed directly and increasingly are estimated through the synthesis of indirect information from multiple data sources. we demonstrate how an evidence synthesis approach to the estimation of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) prevalence in england and wales can be extended to infer the underlying hiv incidence. diverse time series of data can be used to obtain yearly “snapshots” (with associated uncertainty) of the proportion of the population in 4 compartments: not at risk, susceptible, hiv positive but undiagnosed, and diagnosed hiv positive. a multistate model for the infection and diagnosis processes is then formulated by expressing the changes in these proportions by a system of differential equations. by parameterizing incidence in terms of prevalence and contact rates, hiv transmission is further modeled. use of additional data or prior information on demographics, risk behavior change and contact parameters allows simultaneous estimation of the transition rates, compartment prevalences, contact rates, and transmission probabilities.
autonomic pupillary function was assessed with pupillometry in 95 mildly or moderately disabled patients with multiple sclerosis (ms) and 81 healthy subjects. the parasympathetic pupillary function was measured as initial diameter (mm), time to minimum diameter (seconds), reflex amplitude (mm), relative reflex amplitude (%), and maximal constriction velocity (mm/seconds). to reflect the sympathetic pupillary function maximal redilatation velocity (mm/seconds), and time of 75% of redilatation (seconds) were measured. of ms patients 85–99% were within the reference values of healthy subjects. in ms patients the effect of age was observed in the initial diameter, reflex amplitude, and time of 75% redilatation. there were no such age related effects in healthy subjects. in age adjusted analysis the initial diameter and time of 75% redilatation differed significantly from healthy controls. autonomic pupillary functions were not associated with fatigue, visual defect, or bladder disturbance, as measured by fatigue severity scale, kurtzke’s functional system scales, expanded disability status scale, or the multiple sclerosis functional composite. our results suggest that both parasympathetic and sympathetic pupillary functions are disturbed already early in the course of ms. however, the disturbance is not severe at this stage of the disease. the dysfunction is age-dependent and thus possibly related to the dimished remyelination capacity of the central nervous system.  there is evidence that the clinical course of multiple sclerosis is age related. the present study evaluated the relationship between age and rate of disability progression in a large hospital‐based cohort of definite cases of multiple sclerosis (n= 1,463). patients were followed every 6 to 12 months for a total period of observation of 11,387.8 person‐years. expanded disability status scale scores increased significantly with increasing current age and longer duration of disease (p=0.007). median times to reach expanded disability status scale scores of 4.0 and 6.0, assessed using an extended kaplan–meier method with age as a categorical time‐varying covariate, were significantly longer among patients aged 20 to 35 years compared with patients aged 36 to 50 and 51 to 65 years (p < 0.0001). significant associations were observed between mean expanded disability status scale scores and age at disease onset, current age, and the interaction of age at disease onset and current age (p < 0.001). current age had a greater effect (59% of variability in the model) on disease severity than did age at disease onset. furthermore, a multiplicative effect on expanded disability status scale score was observed for age at disease onset and current age combined, indicating a faster rate of disease progression in older patients. in conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrate the impact of age on rate of disability progression in multiple sclerosis and suggest that an age‐adjusted progression index may be a more relevant criterion for defining differences between multiple sclerosis groups.
inductive reasoning is an everyday process that allows us to make sense of the world by creating rules from a series of instances. consistent with accounts of process-based fractionations of the prefrontal cortex (pfc) along the left–right axis, inductive reasoning has been reliably localized to left pfc. however, these results may be confounded by the task domain, which is typically verbal. indeed, some studies show that right pfc activation is seen with spatial tasks. this study used fmri to examine the effects of process and domain on the brain regions recruited during a novel pattern discovery task. twenty healthy young adult participants were asked to discover the rule underlying the presentation of a series of letters in varied spatial locations. the rules were either verbal (pertaining to a single semantic category) or spatial (geometric figures). bilateral ventrolateral pfc activations were seen for the spatial domain, while the verbal domain showed only left ventrolateral pfc. a conjunction analysis revealed that the two domains recruited a common region of left ventrolateral pfc. the data support a central role of left pfc in inductive reasoning. importantly, they also suggest that both process and domain shape the localization of reasoning in the brain.  despite the recent interest in the neuroanatomy of inductive reasoning processes, the regional specificity within prefrontal cortex (pfc) for the different mechanisms involved in induction tasks remains to be determined. in this study, we used fmri to investigate the contribution of pfc regions to rule acquisition (rule search and rule discovery) and rule following. twenty-six healthy young adult participants were presented with a series of images of cards, each consisting of a set of circles numbered in sequence with one colored blue. participants had to predict the position of the blue circle on the next card. the rules that had to be acquired pertained to the relationship among succeeding stimuli. responses given by subjects were categorized in a series of phases either tapping rule acquisition (responses given up to and including rule discovery) or rule following (correct responses after rule acquisition). mid-dorsolateral pfc (mid-dlpfc) was active during rule search and remained active until successful rule acquisition. by contrast, rule following was associated with activation in temporal, motor, and medial/anterior prefrontal cortex. moreover, frontopolar cortex (fpc) was active throughout the rule acquisition and rule following phases before a rule became familiar. we attributed activation in mid-dlpfc to hypothesis generation and in fpc to integration of multiple separate inferences. the present study provides evidence that brain activation during inductive reasoning involves a complex network of frontal processes and that different subregions respond during rule acquisition and rule following phases.
acute myeloid leukemia (aml) with inversion of chromosome 3 is characterized by overexpression of evi1 and carries a dismal prognosis. arsenic-containing compounds have been described to be efficacious in malignancies overexpressing evi1. here, we describe a case of aml with inv(3)(q21q26.2) treated with the organic arsenical darinaparsin. using a “personalized medicine approach,” two different arsenicals were screened for anti-leukemic effect against the patient’s cells ex vivo. the most promising compound, darinaparsin, was selected for in vivo treatment. clinical effect was almost immediate, with a normalization of temperature, a stabilization of white blood cell (wbc) counts and an increased quality of life. longitudinal monitoring of patient response and resistance incorporating significant correlative studies on patient-derived blood samples over the two cycles of darinaparsin given to this patient allowed us to evaluate potential mechanisms of response and resistance. the anti-leukemic effects of darinaparsin correlated with inhibition of the alternative nf-κb pathway and production of the inflammatory cytokine il-8. emergence of resistance was suspected during treatment cycle 2 and supported by xenograft studies in nude mice. darinaparsin resistance correlated with an attenuation of the effect of treatment on the alternative nf-κb pathway. the results from this patient indicate that darinaparsin may be a good treatment option for inv(3) aml and that inhibition of the alternative nf-κb pathway may be predictive of response. longitudinal monitoring of disease response as well as several correlative parameters allowed for the generation of novel correlations and predictors of response to experimental therapy in a heavily pretreated patient.  one of the genes associated with both murine and human myeloid leukemia is evi1 (ecotropic viral integration 1 site). evi1 was first identified as a common locus of retroviral integration in myeloid tumors found in akxd mice. the exact mechanism by which evi1 induces leukemogenesis is not clear. studies of the function of evi1 in the bone marrow and in cell lines have shown that the inappropriate expression of evi1 prohibits terminal differentiation of the bone marrow progenitor cells in granulocytes and erythroid cells, but strongly favors hematopoietic differentiation along the megakaryocytic lineage. we summarize recent data showing that evi1 is a complex transcription factor with multiple functions, and this complexity is further demonstrated by the ability of evi1 to interact with coactivators and corepressors and to abrogate cellular response to cytokines.
tese de doutoramento em psicologia, na especialidade de neuropsicologia, apresentada a faculdade de psicologia e de ciencias da educacao da universidade de coimbra  the free and cued selective reminding test (fcsrt) is a verbal episodic memory test used to identify patients with mild alzheimer's disease (ad). the present study investigates the relationships between performance on fcsrt and grey matter atrophy assessed with structural mri in patients with ad. three complementary mri-based analyses (vbm analysis, roi-based analysis, and three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis) were performed in 35 patients with ad to analyze correlations between regional atrophy and their scores for episodic memory using the fcsrt. with vbm analysis, the total score on the fcsrt was correlated with left medial temporal lobe atrophy including the left hippocampus but also the thalami. in addition, using roi-based analysis, the total recall score on the fcsrt was correlated with the left hippocampal volume. with three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis, both free recall and total recall scores were correlated with regions corresponding approximately to the ca1 field. no correlation was found with short term memory scores using any of these methods of analysis. in ad, the fcsrt may be considered as a useful clinical marker of memory disorders due to medial temporal damage, specially the ca1 field of the hippocampus.
habitat-based surrogates are a low cost alternative to intensive biodiversity surveys, though they have been poorly investigated in semi-arid ecosystem compared to others such as temperate woodlands. in this study we tested potential habitat-based surrogates of invertebrate richness in a semi-arid rangeland in northwest australia. potential surrogates were: distance from artificial watering-point; soil hardness; habitat complexity; and individual complexity components. generalised additive models (gams) were used to relate abundance and richness of selected invertebrates with environmental factors and cluster analysis was used to examine similarity in species composition. the most frequently selected factor was soil hardness, but taxa varied as to whether biodiversity was higher in soft or hard soils. where distance from watering-point was an important predictor, there were generally higher abundances and richness closer to watering-points than further away. abundance and species richness could be partially explained using individual complexity components, but relationships were weak and there were no consistent trends among taxa. therefore, although habitat complexity has been correlated with species richness under some circumstances, our results cast doubt on the generality of this relationship. there are also dangers in assuming that all taxa respond in a manner similar to indicator taxa, as we observed that different taxa had higher richness at opposite extremes of some environmental gradients. grazing may have a negative impact on biodiversity in some environments, but in regions where water is limiting, the net effect may be positive due to the creation of waterholes.  a procedure for the implementation of quality control for laboratorysorting and identification of invertebrate specimens collected in biodiversityresearch is described. the procedure is based on process control sampling, aconcept of statistical process control (spc) used widely in the manufacturingand information technology industries, and adapted to suit the tasks andproducts of biodiversity sorting procedures. the major advantages of processcontrol over other quality control mechanisms are that it is more stringent, andcontinuous. hence, errors are detected and corrected as they occur, avoidingproliferation in the data set. the procedure is also highly interactive,offering the technicians the opportunity to learn as they work. protocols havebeen developed while sorting material collected as part of a study into theimpacts associated with invasion of a habitat (coastal heath) by an exotic weed(bitou bush – chrysanthemoides monilifera) on thecentral coast of new south wales, australia. major findings from the analysis ofmaterial processed include: that errors may have a variety of causes andsubsequent implications for data quality, levels of identification errors can besignificant even at higher taxonomic levels (e.g. sorting insects to order),initial training periods on their own are insufficient to ensure errorminimisation, and even with stringent protocols the ratio of technician tospecialist effort can be maintained at a level of around 5:1. the need forincorporating effective quality control procedures into invertebratebiodiversity data compilations is emphasised.
objective altered cortisol response is a vulnerability marker for a variety of stress-related diseases and psychiatric disorders. childhood adversity has been shown to modify this response, but evidence is inconsistent. effects may differ depending on the timing of exposure, or due to the interplay between pre/postnatal adversity and later adversities. the present study examined the influence of adversity during different timeframes (pre/postnatal, ages 0-5, 6-11, 12-13, 14-15 years), and the interaction between pre/postnatal and later adversity on adolescents' cortisol stress response.   method four salivary cortisol samples were collected before and after a social stress test in 471 16-year-old adolescents from the longitudinal study trails. data on pre/postnatal exposure to adversities were obtained from preventive child healthcare records and parental reports, subsequent adversities from parental and self-reports.   results pre/postnatal adversity was associated with increased cortisol reactivity. adversities during ages 0-5 were not associated with cortisol outcomes. adversities during ages 6-11 were associated with a high cortisol level, especially in those exposed to pre/postnatal adversity, while adversities during ages 12-13 and 14-15 were associated with a low cortisol level.   conclusions results highlight the importance to take the timing of stress exposure into account. in addition to programming effects, pre/postnatal adversity interacts with childhood adversity in producing deviant cortisol levels. puberty may be marked by a transition in how adversities affect the hpa-axis, with cortisol hypersecretion before age 11 and hyposecretion after age 11.  background animal models have linked early maternal separation with lifelong changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (hpa) axis activity. although this is paralleled in human studies, this is often in the context of other life adversities, for example, divorce or adoption, and it is not known whether early separation in the absence of these factors has long term effects on the hpa axis.   aims the finnish experience in world war ii created a natural experiment to test whether separation from a father serving in the armed forces or from both parents due to war evacuation are associated with alterations in hpa axis response to psychosocial stress in late adulthood.   method 282 subjects (m=63.5 years, sd=2.5), of whom 85 were non-separated, 129 were separated from their father, and 68 were separated from both their caregivers during wwii, were enlisted to participate in a trier social stress test (tsst), during which we measured salivary cortisol and, for 215 individuals, plasma cortisol and acth concentrations. we used mixed models to study whether parental separation is associated with salivary and plasma cortisol or plasma acth reactivity, and linear regressions to analyse differences in the baseline, or incremental area under the cortisol or acth curves.   results participants separated from their father did not differ significantly from non-separated participants. however, those separated from both parents had higher average salivary cortisol and plasma acth concentrations across all time points compared to the non-separated group. they also had higher salivary cortisol reactivity to the tsst. separated women had higher baselines in plasma cortisol and acth, whereas men had higher reactivity in response to stress during the tsst. participants who had experienced the separation in early childhood were more affected than children separated during infancy or school age.   conclusions separation from parents during childhood may alter an individual's stress physiology much later in adult life.
a large number of mathematical models have been proposed to describe the measured signal in diffusion‐weighted (dw) magnetic resonance imaging (mri). however, model comparison to date focuses only on specific subclasses, e.g. compartment models or signal models, and little or no information is available in the literature on how performance varies among the different types of models. to address this deficiency, we organized the ‘white matter modeling challenge’ during the international symposium on biomedical imaging (isbi) 2015 conference. this competition aimed to compare a range of different kinds of models in their ability to explain a large range of measurable in vivo dw human brain data. specifically, we assessed the ability of models to predict the dw signal accurately for new diffusion gradients and b values. we did not evaluate the accuracy of estimated model parameters, as a ground truth is hard to obtain. we used the connectome scanner at the massachusetts general hospital, using gradient strengths of up to 300 mt/m and a broad set of diffusion times. we focused on assessing the dw signal prediction in two regions: the genu in the corpus callosum, where the fibres are relatively straight and parallel, and the fornix, where the configuration of fibres is more complex. the challenge participants had access to three‐quarters of the dataset and their models were ranked on their ability to predict the remaining unseen quarter of the data. the challenge provided a unique opportunity for a quantitative comparison of diverse methods from multiple groups worldwide. the comparison of the challenge entries reveals interesting trends that could potentially influence the next generation of diffusion‐based quantitative mri techniques. the first is that signal models do not necessarily outperform tissue models; in fact, of those tested, tissue models rank highest on average. the second is that assuming a non‐gaussian (rather than purely gaussian) noise model provides little improvement in prediction of unseen data, although it is possible that this may still have a beneficial effect on estimated parameter values. the third is that preprocessing the training data, here by omitting signal outliers, and using signal‐predicting strategies, such as bootstrapping or cross‐validation, could benefit the model fitting. the analysis in this study provides a benchmark for other models and the data remain available to build up a more complete comparison in the future.  this paper compares a range of compartment models for diffusion mri data on in vivo human acquisitions from a standard 60mt/m system (philips 3t achieva) and a unique 300mt/m system (siemens connectom). the key aim is to determine whether both systems support broadly the same models or whether the connectom higher gradient system supports significantly more complex models. a single volunteer underwent 8h of acquisition on each system to provide uniquely wide and dense sampling of the available space of pulsed-gradient spin-echo (pgse) measurements. we select a set of promising models from the wide set of possible three-compartment models for in vivo white matter (wm) that previous work and preliminary experiments suggest as strong candidates, but extend them to fit for compartmental t2 and diffusivity. we focus on the corpus callosum where the wm fibre architecture is simplest and compare their ability to explain the measured data, using akaike's information criterion (aic), and to predict unseen data, using cross-validation. we also compare the stability of parameter estimates in the presence of i) noise, using bootstrapping, and ii) spatial variation, using visual assessment and comparison with anatomical knowledge. broadly similar models emerge from the aic and cross-validation experiments in both data sets. specifically, a three-compartment model consisting of either a bingham distribution of sticks or a cylinder for the intracellular compartment, an anisotropic diffusion tensor (dt) model for the extracellular compartment, as well as an isotropic csf compartment, performs consistently well. however, various other models also perform well and no single model emerges as clear winner. the wm data (with virtually no csf contamination) do not support compartmental t2 but partially support compartmental diffusivity. evaluation of parameter stability favours simpler models than those identified by aic or cross-validation. they suggest that the level of complexity in models underpinning currently popular microstructure imaging techniques such as noddi, charmed, or activeax, where the number of free parameters is about 4 or 5 rather than 10 or 11, may reflect the level of complexity achievable for a useful technique on current systems, although the 300mt/m data may support more complex models.
calcium (ca2+) plays essential roles in generative reproduction of angiosperms, but the sites and mechanisms of ca2+ storage and mobilization during pollen-pistil interactions have not been fully defined. both external and internal ca2+ stores are likely important during male gametophyte communication with the sporophytic and gametophytic cells within the pistil. given that calreticulin (crt), a ca2+-buffering protein, is able to bind ca2+ reversibly, it can serve as a mobile store of easily releasable ca2+ (so called an exchangeable ca2+) in eukaryotic cells. crt has typical endoplasmic reticulum (er) targeting and retention signals and resides primarily in the er. however, localization of this protein outside the er has also been revealed in both animal and plant cells, including golgi/dictyosomes, nucleus, plasma membrane/cell surface, plasmodesmata, and even extracellular matrix. these findings indicate that crt may function in a variety of different cell compartments and specialized structures. we have recently shown that crt is highly expressed and accumulated in the er of plant cells involved in pollen-pistil interactions in petunia, and we proposed an essential role for crt in intracellular ca2+ storage and mobilization during the key reproductive events. here, we demonstrate that both crt and exchangeable ca2+ are localized in the intra/extracellular peripheries of highly specialized plant cells, such as the pistil transmitting tract cells, pollen tubes, nucellus cells surrounding the embryo sac, and synergids. based on our present results, we propose that extracellularly located crt is also involved in ca2+ storage and mobilization during sexual reproduction of angiosperms.  using a polyclonal antibody raised against calreticulin purified and sequenced from maize, we performed an immunocytological study to characterize putative domain-specific subcellular distributions of endoplasmic reticulum (er)-resident calreticulin in meristematic cells of maize root tip. at the light microscopy level, calreticulin was immunolocalized preferentially at cellular peripheries, in addition to nuclear envelopes and cytoplasmic structures. punctate labelling at the longitudinal walls and continuous labelling at the transverse walls was characteristic. immunogold electron microscopy revealed plasmodesmata as the most prominently labelled cell periphery structure. in order to further probe the er-domain-specific distribution of maize calreticulin at plasmodesmata, root apices were exposed to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. plasmolysis was associated with prominent accumulations of calreticulin at callose-enriched plasmodesmata and pit fields while the contracting protoplasts were depleted of calreticulin. in contrast, other er-resident proteins recognized by hdel peptide and bip antibodies localized exclusively to contracted protoplasts. this finding reveals that, in plasmolysed cells, calreticulin enriched er domains at plasmodesmata and pit fields are depleted of other er-resident proteins containing the hdel retention peptide.
in this paper, we investigate the use of some well-known versions of particle swarm optimization (pso): the canonical pso with gbest model and lbest model with ring topology, the bare bones pso (bbpso) and the fully informed particle swarm (fips) on noisy optimization problems. as far as we know, some of these versions like bbpso and fips had not been previously applied to noisy functions yet. a hybrid approach which consists of the swarm algorithms combined with a jump strategy has been developed for static environments. here, we focus on investigating the introduction of the jump strategy to the swarm algorithms now applied to noisy optimization problems. the hybrid approach is compared experimentally on different noisy benchmark functions. simulation results indicate that the addition of the jump strategy to the swarm algorithms is beneficial in terms of robustness.  particle swarm optimization has become a common heuristic technique in the optimization community, with many researchers exploring the concepts, issues, and applications of the algorithm. in spite of this attention, there has as yet been no standard definition representing exactly what is involved in modern implementations of the technique. a standard is defined here which is designed to be a straightforward extension of the original algorithm while taking into account more recent developments that can be expected to improve performance on standard measures. this standard algorithm is intended for use both as a baseline for performance testing of improvements to the technique, as well as to represent pso to the wider optimization community
this study examined whether symptoms (motor, cognitive, vision, sleepiness, depression) of parkinson’s disease (pd) were associated with restricted driving practices. to quantify driving practices, electronic devices were installed in the vehicles of 27 drivers with pd (78 % men; m = 71.6, sd = 6.6; unified parkinson’s disease rating scale (updrs) motor score m = 30.1, sd = 8.6; disease duration m = 3.9, sd = 2.8 years) and 20 controls (80 % men; m = 70.6, sd = 7.9) for 2 weeks. participants completed measures of sleepiness, depression, quality of life, and assessments of motor, cognitive and visual functions. the pd group had significantly slower brake response times (p < 0.05), poorer cognitive and quality of life scores (p < 0.01) and greater depression (p < 0.05) compared to controls. slower reaction time was significantly related to reduced driving; specifically, fewer trips (r = −0.46; p < 0.05), distance (r = −0.54, p < 0.01) and duration at night (r = −0.58, p < 0.01). better cognitive scores were associated with driving less often in difficult situations such as bad weather and rush hour (p < 0.05), as well as reduced speed on city streets, but only for the control group. while most drivers with pd rated their overall health as good or excellent, the five pd drivers who rated their health more poorly had significantly worse clinical symptoms (updrs motor scores, contrast sensitivity, depression, brake response time) and more restricted driving patterns. these findings show that drivers with pd who perceive their health poorly have greater symptomatology and were more likely to restrict their driving, possibly due to noticeable declines in multiple driving-related abilities.  cognitive impairment is common in parkinson's disease (pd) and can occur early in the disease course. no effective screening test exists for detection of early or mild cognitive impairment in pd. we examined the montreal cognitive assessment (moca) as a screening tool for cognitive dysfunction in pd. the test–retest intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.79 and the interrater intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.81. the correlation coefficient between the moca and a neuropsychologic battery was 0.72. the moca is reliable and valid in the pd population and warrants further study as a screening tool for cognitive dysfunction. © 2008 movement disorder society
climate change can impact the pattern of marine biodiversity through changes in species’ distributions. however, global studies on climate change impacts on ocean biodiversity have not been performed so far. our paper aims to investigate the global patterns of such impacts by projecting the distributional ranges of a sample of 1066 exploited marine fish and invertebrates for 2050 using a newly developed dynamic bioclimate envelope model. our projections show that climate change may lead to numerous local extinction in the sub-polar regions, the tropics and semi-enclosed seas. simultaneously, species invasion is projected to be most intense in the arctic and the southern ocean. together, they result in dramatic species turnovers of over 60% of the present biodiversity, implying ecological disturbances that potentially disrupt ecosystem services. our projections can be viewed as a set of hypothesis for future analytical and empirical studies.  global climate change is recognized as an important determining factor for the future distributions of marine organisms, notably fishes and invertebrates. shifting of distribution range may affect global marine fisheries and have large socio-economic implications. however, globalscale evaluation of the impact of climate change on marine species is lacking. in this paper, we develop a dynamic bioclimate envelope model to predict the effect of climate change on the distributions of marine species with emphasis on commercially exploited fishes and invertebrates. first, the model infers, for various species, bioclimate envelopes based on their current distribution. bioclimate envelopes are defined by sea water temperature, bathymetry, habitats and distance from sea ice. secondly, the model predicts the shifting of the bioclimate envelopes induced by changes in climate variables. simultaneously, following the shifting of the bioclimate envelopes, the model simulates movement of relative abundance through changes in population growth, mortality, larval dispersal and adult movement. we test the model with several commercially exploited fish species with widely different biogeography. the model provides reasonable and robust predictions of future distribution ranges of the four species under different scenarios of sea water warming. moreover, the predictions are robust to major model assumptions and parameter uncertainty. using realistic climate change predictions from the noaa/gfdl coupled model, this model will be used to evaluate impacts of climate change on global marine fisheries. introduction there is ample evidence from empirical observations and climate models indicating that mean global temperatures have been increasing over the last 100 years (ipcc 2007). global temperature has increased by over 0.6 oc since 1900 and it may continue to increase at a rate of around 0.2 oc per decade (ipcc 2007). biological responses to this change have been observed in both terrestrial and marine biomes (murawski 1993; hughes 2000; mccarty 2001; parmesan & yohe 2003; perry et al. 2005; hobday et al. 2006). the responses include changes in physiology (e.g. productivity), geographic range and phenology at population, species, community and ecosystem levels (hughes 2000; mccarty 2001). for instance, nearly two-thirds of marine fishes in the north sea shifted in mean latitude or depth or both over 25 years as sea temperature increased (perry et al. 2005). during the last century, annual growth rates for the juveniles of eight long-lived fish species in the southwest pacific increased in shallow waters and decreased in deep waters where ocean warming and cooling occurred, respectively (thresher et al 2007). this agrees with the quantitative model of fish physiology, which predicts increasing growth performance and fecundity in higher latitude and the converse in lower latitude as sea 1 cited as: cheung, w.w.l., lam, v.w.y., pauly, d. 2008. dynamic bioclimate envelope model to predict climate-induced changes in distribution of marine fishes and invertebrates, p. 5-50. in: cheung, w.w.l, lam, v.w.y., pauly, d.

we present a novel adaptive clustering model for coreference resolution in which the expert rules of a state of the art deterministic system are used as features over pairs of clusters. a significant advantage of the new approach is that the expert rules can be easily augmented with new semantic features. we demonstrate this advantage by incorporating semantic compatibility features for neutral pronouns computed from web n-gram statistics. experimental results show that the combination of the new features with the expert rules in the adaptive clustering approach results in an overall performance improvement, and over 5% improvement in f1 measure for the target pronouns when evaluated on the ace 2004 newswire corpus.  most coreference resolution models determine if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over a set of constraints or features. this approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. to overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. each tier builds on the previous tier's entity cluster output. further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. this cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. the framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. in spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. this suggests that sieve-based approaches could be applied to other nlp tasks.
desensitization in pentameric ligand-gated ion channels plays an important role in regulating neuronal excitability. here, we show that docosahexaenoic acid (dha), a key ω−3 polyunsaturated fatty acid in synaptic membranes, enhances the agonist-induced transition to the desensitized state in the prokaryotic channel glic. we determined a 3.25 å crystal structure of the glic-dha complex in a potentially desensitized conformation. the dha molecule is bound at the channel-periphery near the m4 helix and exerts a long-range allosteric effect on the pore across domain-interfaces. in this previously unobserved conformation, the extracellular-half of the pore-lining m2 is splayed open, reminiscent of the open conformation, while the intracellular-half is constricted, leading to a loss of both water and permeant ions. these findings, in combination with spin-labeling/epr spectroscopic measurements in reconstituted-membranes, provide novel mechanistic details of desensitization in pentameric channels. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.23886.001  the nicotinic acetylcholine (ach) receptor converts transiently to an open-channel form when activated by ach released into the synaptic cleft. we describe here the conformational change underlying this event, determined by electron microscopy of ach-sprayed and freeze-trapped postsynaptic membranes. ach binding to the α subunits triggers a concerted rearrangement in the ligand-binding domain, involving an ~ 1‐å outward displacement of the extracellular portion of the β subunit where it interacts with the juxtaposed ends of α-helices shaping the narrow membrane-spanning pore. the β-subunit helices tilt outward to accommodate this displacement, destabilising the arrangement of pore-lining helices, which in the closed channel bend inward symmetrically to form a central hydrophobic gate. straightening and tangential motion of the pore-lining helices effect channel opening by widening the pore asymmetrically and increasing its polarity in the region of the gate. the pore-lining helices of the αγ and δ subunits, by flexing between alternative bent and straight conformations, undergo the greatest movements. this coupled allosteric transition shifts the structure from a tense (closed) state toward a more relaxed (open) state.
in a clinical trial on efficacy of pentamidine in second stage trypanosoma brucei gambiense patients with </=20 cells/microl in cerebrospinal fluid (csf), 43% of treatment failures were observed. we hypothesised that unsuccessful treatment was caused by uncured brain infection. the relationship between treatment outcome and csf cell count, protein concentration, presence of trypanosomes, the intrathecal immune response, and csf total igm and trypanosome specific antibodies detected by latex/igm and latex/t.b. gambiense card agglutination tests was examined. cell counts of 11-20 cells/microl, intrathecal igm synthesis, csf end-titres in latex/igm >/=4 and latex/t.b. gambiense positive csf, were associated with treatment failure. detection of intrathecal igm synthesis is valuable for assessment of brain involvement and treatment decision.  the committee of the european concerted action for multiple sclerosis (charcot foundation) organised five workshops to discuss csf analytical standards in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. this consensus report from 12 european countries summarises the results of those workshops. it is hoped that neurologists will confer with their colleagues in clinical chemistry to arrange the best possible local practice. the most sensitive method for the detection of oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands is isoelectric focusing. the same amounts of igg in parallel csf and serum samples are used and oligoclonal bands are revealed with igg specific antibody staining. all laboratories performing isoelectric focusing should check their technique at least annually using “blind” standards for the five different csf and serum patterns. quantitative measurements of igg production in the cns are less sensitive than isoelectric focusing. the preferred method for detection of blood-csf barrier dysfunction is the albumin quotient. the csf albumin or total protein concentrations are less satisfactory. these results must be interpreted with reference to the age of the patient and the local method of determination. cells should be counted. the normal value is no more than 4 cells/microliters. among evolving optional tests, measurement of the combined local synthesis of antibodies against measles, rubella, and/or varicella zoster could represent a significant advance if it offers higher specificity (not sensitivity) for identifying chronic rather than acute inflammation. other tests that may have useful correlations with clinical indices include those for oligoclonal free light chains, igm, iga, or myelin basic protein concentrations.
bindin, a protein involved in sea urchin sperm-egg recognition and adhesion, is under positive selection in genera with sympatric species but evolves neutrally in genera in which all species are allopatric. this pattern has led to suggestions that reinforcement may be the source of the observed selection. reproductive character displacement, or increased divergence of reproductive characters in areas where closely related species overlap, is often a consequence of reinforcement and has been shown to be present in one indo-pacific species of the genus echinometra. in the atlantic species of the same genus, positive selection has been shown to act on bindin of echinometra lucunter. to examine whether the source of this selection is reinforcement, we determined variation on the first exon of bindin in e. lucunter in the caribbean, where it is sympatric with echinometra viridis, and in the rest of the atlantic, where e. viridis is absent. there was no differentiation between bindin sequences from the two geographic regions; similar levels of positive selection were found to be acting in both areas. the similarities were not due to gene flow; mitochondrial dna from the two regions indicates that e. lucunter populations most likely originated in the atlantic and have not exchanged genes with caribbean populations for approximately 200,000 years. the lack of evidence of stronger selection on bindin of e. lucunter in areas of sympatry with its sister species suggests that the source of selection is not reinforcement. processes acting within species, such as sexual selection, sperm competition, or sexual conflict, are more likely to be involved in the evolution of this molecule.  bindin is a gamete recognition protein known to control species-specific sperm-egg adhesion and membrane fusion in sea urchins. previous analyses have shown that diversifying selection on bindin amino acid sequence is found when gametically incompatible species are compared, but not when species are compatible. the present study analyzes bindin polymorphism and divergence in the three closely related species of echinometra in central america: e. lucunter and e. viridis from the caribbean, and e. vanbrunti from the eastern pacific. the eggs of e. lucunter have evolved a strong block to fertilization by sperm of its neotropical congeners, whereas those of the other two species have not. as in the indo-west pacific (iwp) echinometra, the neotropical species show high intraspecific bindin polymorphism in the same gene regions as in the iwp species. maximum likelihood analysis shows that many of the polymorphic codon sites are under mild positive selection. of the fixed amino acid replacements, most have accumulated along the bindin lineage of e. lucunter. we analyzed the data with maximum likelihood models of variation in positive selection across lineages and codon sites, and with models that consider sites and lineages simultaneously. our results show that positive selection is concentrated along the e. lucunter bindin lineage, and that codon sites with amino acid replacements fixed in this species show by far the highest signal of positive selection. lineage-specific positive selection paralleling egg incompatibility provides support that adaptive evolution of sperm proteins acts to maintain recognition of bindin by changing egg receptors. because both egg incompatibility and bindin divergence are greater between allopatric species than between sympatric species, the hypothesis of selection against hybridization (reinforcement) cannot explain why adaptive evolution has been confined to a single lineage in the american echinometra. instead, processes acting to varying degrees within species (e.g., sperm competition, sexual selection, and sexual conflict) are more promising explanations for lineage-specific positive selection on bindin.
backgroundexposure to particulate matter (pm) is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and increased coagulation, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations remain unknown. obesity may increase susceptibility to the adverse effects of pm exposure, exacerbating the effects on cardiovascular diseases. extracellular vesicles (evs), which travel in body fluids and transfer micrornas (mirnas) between tissues, might play an important role in pm-induced cardiovascular risk. we sought to determine whether the levels of pm with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm (pm10) are associated with changes in fibrinogen levels, ev release, and the mirna content of evs (ev-mirnas), investigating 1630 overweight/obese subjects from the sphere study.resultsshort-term exposure to pm10 (day before blood drawing) was associated with an increased release of evs quantified by nanoparticle tracking analysis, especially evs derived from monocyte/macrophage components (cd14+) and platelets (cd61+) which were characterized by flow cytometry. we first profiled mirnas of 883 subjects by the quantstudio™ 12 k flex real time pcr system and the top 40 ev-mirnas were validated through custom mirna plates. nine ev-mirnas (let-7c-5p; mir-106a-5p; mir-143-3p; mir-185-5p; mir-218-5p; mir-331-3p; mir-642-5p; mir-652-3p; mir-99b-5p) were downregulated in response to pm10 exposure and exhibited putative roles in cardiovascular disease, as highlighted by integrated network analysis. pm10 exposure was significantly associated with elevated fibrinogen levels, and five of the nine downregulated ev-mirnas were mediators between pm10 exposure and fibrinogen levels.conclusionsresearch on evs opens a new path to the investigation of the adverse health effects of air pollution exposure. evs have the potential to act both as markers of pm susceptibility and as potential molecular mechanism in the chain of events connecting pm exposure to increased coagulation, which is frequently linked to exposure and cvd development.  elevated levels of fibrinogen are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, whereas low fibrinogen can lead to a bleeding disorder. we investigated whether micrornas (mirnas), known to act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, regulate fibrinogen production. using transfection of a library of 470 annotated human mirna precursor molecules in huh7 hepatoma cells and quantitative measurements of fibrinogen production, we identified 23 mirnas with down-regulating (up to 64% decrease) and 4 with up-regulating effects (up to 129% increase) on fibrinogen production. among the down-regulating mirnas, we investigated the mechanism of action of 3 hsa-mir-29 family members and hsa-mir-409-3p. overexpression of hsa-mir-29 members led to decreased steady-state levels of all fibrinogen gene (fga, fgb, and fgg) transcripts in huh7 cells. luciferase reporter gene assays demonstrated that this was independent of mirna-fibrinogen 3'-untranslated region interactions. in contrast, overexpression of hsa-mir-409-3p specifically lowered fibrinogen bβ mrna levels, and this effect was dependent on a target site in the fibrinogen bβ mrna 3'-untranslated region. this study adds to the known mechanisms that control fibrinogen production, points toward a potential cause of variable circulating fibrinogen levels, and demonstrates that a screening approach can identify mirnas that regulate clinically important proteins.
although evolutionary change within most species is thought to occur slowly, recent studies have identified cases where evolutionary change has apparently occurred over a few generations. anthropogenically altered environments appear particularly open to rapid evolutionary change over comparatively short time scales. here, we consider a pacific salmon population that may have experienced life‐history evolution, in response to habitat alteration, within a few generations. historically, juvenile fall chinook salmon (oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the snake river migrated as subyearlings to the ocean. with changed riverine conditions that resulted from hydropower dam construction, some juveniles now migrate as yearlings, but more interestingly, the yearling migration tactic has made a large contribution to adult returns over the last decade. optimal life‐history models suggest that yearling juvenile migrants currently have a higher fitness than subyearling migrants. although phenotypic plasticity likely accounts for some of the change in migration tactics, we suggest that evolution also plays a significant role. evolutionary change prompted by anthropogenic alterations to the environment has general implications for the recovery of endangered species. the case study we present herein illustrates the importance of integrating evolutionary considerations into conservation planning for species at risk.  salmonine fishes are commonly subjected to strong, novel selective pressures due to anthropogenic activities and global climate change, often resulting in population extinction. consequently, there is considerable interest in predicting the long‐term evolutionary trajectories of extant populations. knowledge of the genetic architecture of fitness traits is integral to making these predictions. we reviewed the published, peer‐reviewed literature for estimates of heritability and genetic correlation for fitness traits in salmonine fishes with two broad goals in mind: summarization of published data and testing for differences among categorical variables (e.g., species, life history type, experimental conditions). balanced coverage of variables was lacking and estimates for wild populations and behavioral traits were nearly absent. distributions of heritability estimates were skewed toward low values and distributions of genetic correlations toward large, positive values, suggesting that significant potential for evolution of traits exists. furthermore, experimental conditions had a direct effect on h2 estimates, and other variables had more complex effects on h2 and rg estimates, suggesting that available estimates may be insufficient for use in models to predict evolutionary change in wild populations. given this and other inherent complicating factors, making accurate predictions of the evolutionary trajectories of salmonine fishes will be a difficult task.
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are among the most widely used drugs for the management of acute and chronic pain. the role of the opioid system in the synergism between nsaids is not well characterized. mice were injected with a 5% formalin solution (20 μl) into the upper right lip to perform an orofacial formalin test. the isobolographic method was used to determine the interaction between dexketoprofen, which is the (s)-(+) enantiomer of ketoprofen, and meloxicam co-administration. additionally, the non-selective, opioid antagonist naltrexone, the selective δ opioid receptor (dop) antagonist naltrindole and the selective κ opioid receptor (kop) antagonist norbinaltorphimine were used to assess the opioid effects on this interaction. intraperitoneal administration of dexketoprofen or meloxicam induced dose-dependent antinociception with different phase i and phase ii potencies in the orofacial formalin test. meloxicam displayed similar potencies (ed(50)) in phase i (7.20 mg/kg) and phase ii (8.60 mg/kg). dexketoprofen was more potent in phase i (19.96 mg/kg) than in phase ii (50.90 mg/kg). the interactions between dexketoprofen and meloxicam were synergistic in both phases. this was determined based on the fixed ratios (1:1) of their ed(50) values, which were determined by isobolographic analysis. furthermore, this antinociceptive activity does not seem to be modulated by opioid receptor blockers because they did not induce changes in the nature of this interaction. this finding may be relevant with regards to nsaid multi-modal analgesia where an opioid antagonist must be used.  summarydexketoprofen trometamol is a water-soluble salt of the dextrorotatory enantiomer of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) ketoprofen. racemic ketoprofen is used as an analgesic and an anti-inflammatory agent, and is one of the most potent in vitro inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis. this effect is due to the s(+)-enantiomer (dexketoprofen), while the r(−)-enantiomer is devoid of such activity.the pharmacokinetic profile of ketoprofen and its enantiomers was assessed in several animal species and in human volunteers. in humans, the relative bioavailability of oral dexketoprofen trometamol (12.5 and 25mg, respectively) is similar to that of oral racemic ketoprofen (25 and 50mg, respectively), as measured in all cases by the area under the concentration-time curve values for s(+)-ketoprofen. dexketoprofen trometamol, given as a tablet, is rapidly absorbed, with a time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of between 0.25 and 0.75 hours, whereas the tmax for the s-enantiomer after the racemic drug, administered as tablets or capsules prepared with the free acid, is between 0.5 and 3 hours. peak plasma concentrations of 1.4 and 3.1 mg/l are reached after administration of dexketoprofen trometamol 12.5 and 25mg, respectively.from 70 to 80% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine during the first 12 hours, mainly as the acyl-glucuronoconjugated parent drug. no r(−)-ketoprofen is found in the urine after administration of dexketoprofen [s(+)-ketoprofen], confirming the absence of bioinversion of the s(+)-enantiomer in humans.in animal studies, the anti-inflammatory potency of dexketoprofen was always equivalent to that demonstrated by twice the dose of ketoprofen. similarly, animal studies showed a high analgesic potency for dexketoprofen trometamol. the r(−)-enantiomer demonstrated a much lower potency, its analgesic action being apparent only in conditions where the metabolic bioinversion to the s(+)-enantiomer was significant.the gastric ulcerogenic effects of dexketoprofen at various oral doses (1.5 to 6 mg/kg) in the rat do not differ from those of the corresponding double doses (3 to 12 mg/kg) of racemic ketoprofen. repeated (5-day) oral administration of dexketoprofen as the trometamol salt causes less gastric ulceration than was observed after the acid form of both dexketoprofen and the racemate. in addition, single dose dexketoprofen as the free acid at 10 or 20 mg/kg does not show a significant intestinal ulcerogenic effect in rats, while racemic ketoprofen 20 or 40 mg/kg is clearly ulcerogenic to the small intestine.the analgesic efficacy of oral dexketoprofen trometamol 10 and 20mg is superior to that of placebo and similar to that of ibuprofen 400mg in patients with moderate to severe pain after third molar extraction. the time to onset of pain relief appeared to be shorter in patients treated with dexketoprofen trometamol than in those treated with ibuprofen 400mg. dexketoprofen trometamol was well tolerated, with a reported incidence of adverse events similar to that of placebo.
of the eight catalytic transglutaminases (tgs), transglutaminase 2 (tg2) has been the most comprehensively studied due to its ubiquitous expression in multiple cell types. despite the observed critical role for this enzyme in multiple biological processes in vitro, tg2 knockout mouse models have shown no severe developmental phenotypes, suggesting compensation by other tgs. to begin characterization of the compensating mechanisms, we analyzed total transamidating activity and expression patterns of all catalytically active tgs in seven different tissues/organs from wild-type and tg2 knockout mice. inhibitory analysis with tg2-specific inhibitor kcc-009 suggests that relative contribution of tg2 in total transamidating activity differs in various tissues. accordingly, our data indicate tissue-specific mechanisms of compensation for the loss of tg2, including transcriptional compensation in heart and liver versus functional compensation in aorta, kidney and skeletal/cartiagenous tissues. on the contrary, no compensation has been detected in skeletal muscle, suggesting a limited role for the tg2-mediated transamidation in normal development of this tissue.  we previously used subtractive hybridization to isolate cdnas for genes upregulated in chick hypertrophic chondrocytes (nurminskaya, m., and t.f. linsenmayer. 1996. dev. dyn. 206:260–271). certain of these showed homology with the “a” subunit of human plasma transglutaminase (factor xiiia), a member of a family of enzymes that cross-link a variety of intracellular and matrix molecules. we now have isolated a full-length cdna for this molecule, and confirmed that it is avian factor xiiia. northern and enzymatic analyses confirm that the molecule is upregulated in hypertrophic chondrocytes (as much as eightfold). the enzymatic analyses also show that appreciable transglutaminase activity in the hypertrophic zone becomes externalized into the extracellular matrix. this externalization most likely is effected by cell death and subsequent lysis—effected by the transglutaminase itself. when hypertrophic chondrocytes are transfected with a cdna construct encoding the zymogen of factor xiiia, the cells convert the translated protein to a lower molecular weight form, and they initiate cell death, become permeable to macromolecules and eventually undergo lysis. non-hypertrophic cells transfected with the same construct do not show these degenerative changes. these results suggest that hypertrophic chondrocytes have a novel, tissue-specific cascade of mechanisms that upregulate the synthesis of plasma transglutaminase and activate its zymogen. this produces autocatalytic cell death, externalization of the enzyme, and presumably cross-linking of components within the hypertrophic matrix. these changes may in turn regulate the removal and/or calcification of this hypertrophic matrix, which are its ultimate fates.
backgroundaccurate and efficient rna secondary structure prediction remains an important open problem in computational molecular biology. historically, advances in computing technology have enabled faster and more accurate rna secondary structure predictions. previous parallelized prediction programs achieved significant improvements in runtime, but their implementations were not portable from niche high-performance computers or easily accessible to most rna researchers. with the increasing prevalence of multi-core desktop machines, a new parallel prediction program is needed to take full advantage of today’s computing technology.findingswe present here the first implementation of rna secondary structure prediction by thermodynamic optimization for modern multi-core computers. we show that gtfold predicts secondary structure in less time than unafold and rnafold, without sacrificing accuracy, on machines with four or more cores.conclusionsgtfold supports advances in rna structural biology by reducing the timescales for secondary structure prediction. the difference will be particularly valuable to researchers working with lengthy rna sequences, such as rna viral genomes.  a dynamic programming algorithm for prediction of rna secondary structure has been revised to accommodate folding constraints determined by chemical modification and to include free energy increments for coaxial stacking of helices when they are either adjacent or separated by a single mismatch. furthermore, free energy parameters are revised to account for recent experimental results for terminal mismatches and hairpin, bulge, internal, and multibranch loops. to demonstrate the applicability of this method, in vivo modification was performed on 5s rrna in both escherichia coli and candida albicans with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate, dimethyl sulfate, and kethoxal. the percentage of known base pairs in the predicted structure increased from 26.3% to 86.8% for the e. coli sequence by using modification constraints. for c. albicans, the accuracy remained 87.5% both with and without modification data. on average, for these sequences and a set of 14 sequences with known secondary structure and chemical modification data taken from the literature, accuracy improves from 67% to 76%. this enhancement primarily reflects improvement for three sequences that are predicted with <40% accuracy on the basis of energetics alone. for these sequences, inclusion of chemical modification constraints improves the average accuracy from 28% to 78%. for the 11 sequences with <6% pseudoknotted base pairs, structures predicted with constraints from chemical modification contain on average 84% of known canonical base pairs.
the 5′ untranslated regions (utr) of chloroplast mrnas often contain regulatory sequences that control rna stability and/or translation. the petd chloroplast mrna in chlamydomonas reinhardtii has three such essential regulatory elements in its 362-nt long 5′ utr. to further analyze these elements, we compared 5′ utr sequences from four chlamydomonas species (c. reinhardtii, c. incerta, c. moewusii and c. eugametos) and five independent strains of c. reinhardtii. overall, these petd 5′ utrs have relatively low sequence conservation across these species. in contrast, sequences of the three regulatory elements and their relative positions appear partially conserved. functionality of the 5′ utrs was tested in c. reinhardtii chloroplasts using β-glucuronidase reporter genes, and the nearly identical c. incerta petd functioned for mrna stability and translation in c. reinhardtii chloroplasts while the more divergent c. eugametos petd did not. this identified what may be key features in these elements. we conclude that these petd regulatory elements, and possibly the corresponding trans-acting factors, function via mechanisms highly specific and surprisingly sensitive to minor sequence changes. this provides a new and broader perspective of these important regulatory sequences that affect photosynthesis in these algae.  in the green unicellular alga chlamydomonas eugametos, cellular division is readily synchronized by light/dark cycles. under these conditions, light initiates photosynthetic growth in daughter cells and begins the g1 phase. genes whose expression is regulated upon illumination are likely to be important mechanisms controlling cell proliferation. to identify some of those genes, two cdna libraries were prepared with poly(a)+ extracted from cells either stimulated with light for 1 h or held in darkness (quiescent cells) during the same period. to restrict our analysis to those genes that are part of the primary response, cells were incubated in presence of cycloheximide. differential screening of approximately 40 000 clones in each library revealed 44 clones which hybridize preferentially with a [32p] cdna probe derived from rna of light-stimulated cells and 15 clones which react selectively with a [32p] cdna probe synthesized from poly(a)+ rna of quiescent cells. cross-hybridization of these clones identified 4 independent sequences in the light-induced (li) collection and 2 in the uninduced (lr) library. four of these cdnas correspond to mrnas that are positively or negatively regulated upon activation of photosynthesis. one clone represents a mrna that accumulates transitorily at both transitions. finally, li818 cdna identifies a new chlorophyll a/b-binding (cab) gene family whose mrna accumulation is controlled by light and a circadian oscillator. the endogenous timing system controls li818 mrna accumulation so that it precedes the onset of illumination by a few hours. on the other hand, light affects li818 mrna levels independently of active photosynthesis.
background and aims: attention to the development of children as the future generation that leads to the upbringing of productive human resources is an important subject. development has dimensions that a child should acquire the skills related to them in proper age. otherwise, he may be affected by developmental delays. there are different factors influencing children's developmental delays and this study is carried out to evaluate the developmental conditions of 1-year-old children in the isfahan and its effective factors. materials and methods: in a historical cohort, 725 children born in 2013 were selected using multi-stage random sampling from health centers licensed by isfahan medical university and followed up to 1-year and their related specifications were extracted from ages and stages questionnaire and their families’ files. spss 20 software and pearson and spearman correlation coefficients, independent t-tests, anova, multiple linear regression and analysis of covariance were used for analyzing the data. results: the minimum and maximum scores of development were observed in the personal-social domain (52.38 ± 9.1) and fine motor (56.06 ± 5.9), respectively. the results showed that the child spacing has direct relation with development in fine motor domain (r = 0.2, p < 0.001), personal-social development (r = 0.197, p = 0.001), and problem solving domain (r = 0.18, p = 0.002). the score for the development in gross motor skills had a direct correlation with the weight at birth (r = 0.129, p < 0.001). breastfeeding also improved personal-social development (p = 0.024). sex (p = 0.024) and living place with communication skills also showed significant relations (p < 0.001). conclusion: the factors such as the child's sex, feeding in the first 6 months of age, living in urban or rural areas are effective in delayed development. considering these factors to prevent adverse effects of the elements and rapid identification of children with delayed development as well as timely therapeutic interventions are essential in the health care system.  the number of children at risk for delays in motor and social development (msd) associated with preterm delivery and low birthweight is increasing, but such children are generally not seen as being in need of evaluation. the objective of these analyses was to determine whether there are independent effects of birthweight and gestational age on msd and the magnitude of effects. subjects were a representative sample of 4621 us-born singleton children, aged 2-47 months, examined in the third national health and nutrition examination survey (1988-94). msd was assessed using an age-appropriate scale. birthweight and gestational age were taken from birth certificates. mexican-american and 'other' race/ethnicity (other than non-hispanic white, non-hispanic black or mexican-american), low parental education level, older maternal age, higher birth order, low birthweight (lbw, <2500 g) and preterm delivery (<37 weeks) were all found to be associated with significant (p < 0.01) delays in msd. three per cent of the infants and children were preterm lbw and 2.2% term lbw (<2500 g, 37-44 weeks). adjusting for socio-demographic factors, preterm lbw children had lower msd scores (-1.5 +/- 0.3 points, p < 0.0001) through early childhood, as did term lbw children (0.8 +/- 0.4 points, p < 0.03). for females, lbw was the most important perinatal predictor of a lowered score (-0.9 +/- 0.3 points compared with normal birthweight, p < 0.04). for males, scores were additionally decreased by -0.1 +/- 0.03 points/week (p=0.001) of early delivery. lbw children had less muscle mass, but adjusting for muscularity did not diminish the effects of birth size on msd. lbw status and preterm delivery are associated independently with small, but measurable, delays in msd through early childhood and should be considered along with other known risk factors for development delays in determining the need for developmental evaluation.
introductionin animal models, lipid emulsion therapy has been shown to ameliorate toxicity from a number of lipid soluble agents. this preliminary study addresses the hypothesis that pretreatment with lipid emulsion protects against propranolol toxicity in rodents.methodsten spontaneously ventilating rattus norvegicus rats were pretreated with either lipid emulsion or 0.9% normal saline before undergoing a constant infusion of propranolol until death. an electrocardiogram (ecg) sampling of heart rate and a qrs duration was performed at two-minute intervals until demise.resultsthere was no significant difference in lethal doses of propranolol between groups. comparison of percent change in qrs prolongation and heart rate reduction was performed at 60% of the mean lethal dose in control animals. the percent change in qrs duration was reduced (from −0.9 to 17.3, p = 0.016) in the intralipid pretreatment group. attenuation of propranolol-induced bradycardia observed in the lipid emulsion group approached statistical significance (0% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.06).interpretationthe results suggest that lipid emulsion may be effective in ameliorating propranolol toxicity in rats. previous work gives reason to postulate a pharmacokinetic mechanism for this effect. the results represent encouraging exploratory work, and further work is planned to evaluate the role of lipid emulsion therapy in propranolol toxicity.  amphotericin b (amb) remains the gold standard for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. however, the efficacy is limited, with response rates from 10% to 80%. moreover, amb is toxic, especially for the kidneys. new formulations have been developed in an attempt to improve both efficacy and tolerability. in an attempt to reduce toxicity, a number of investigators have reconstituted amb in a lipid emulsion, but few data are available on efficacy in documented infections. an improvement in immediate and renal tolerance was obtained with equivalent daily dose regimens, but the therapeutic index does not appear to be improved. this approach cannot be recommended at present. three lipid formulations have been developed and are now available in most countries: amb colloidal dispersion (abcd), amb lipid complex (ablc), and liposomal amb (ambisome). the efficacy of abcd on various fungal infections has been assessed in open trials, with a response rate of 49% in aspergillosis, 70% in candidiasis, and 67% in mucormycosis. in two randomized trials comparing abcd with amb in invasive aspergillosis and in persistent febrile neutropenia, the response rates were equivalent. abcd was less nephrotoxic. in contrast, immediate reactions to abcd were as frequent and severe as with amb. these immediate effects are more frequent during the first infusions and lessen as treatment continues. the recommended dose is 3–4 mg/kg/day. ablc appeared to be effective as rescue therapy in various types of invasive mycoses, with a response rate of 42% in aspergillosis, 67% in candidiasis, and 82% in fusariosis. efficacy identical to that of amb was demonstrated in a comparative randomized trial involving patients with invasive candidiasis. general and renal tolerability is improved compared with amb. the recommended dose regimen is 5 mg/kg/day. liposomal amb (ambisome) is the only truly liposomal formulation. the response rates in preliminary trials were 66% in aspergillosis and 81% in candidiasis. several comparative studies have confirmed that this formulation has similar or superior efficacy relative to amb in various fungal infections and also in the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. renal and general tolerability is excellent. the optimal dosing remains unclear but is generally between 3 and 5 mg/kg/day. a double‐blind trial comparing the tolerance of liposomal amb and ablc demonstrated that both infusion‐related events and nephrotoxicity were significantly lower for liposomal amb. in sum, the new lipid formulations of amb are effective in various invasive fungal infections. the three formulations exhibit reduced nephrotoxicity compared with conventional amb. large‐scale comparative clinical trials may clarify issues of relative efficacy in various forms of mycotic infections. note
parkinson's disease (pd) is characterized by a selective degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. epidemiological studies revealed a male predominance of the disease that has been attributed to the female steroid hormones, mainly the estrogen. estrogen neuroprotective effects have been shown in several studies, however the mechanisms responsible by these effects are still unclear. previous data from our group revealed that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) is crucial to the dopaminergic protection provided by 17β-estradiol, and also suggest that the intracellular estrogen receptors (ers) are not required for that neuroprotective effects. the present study aimed to investigate the contribution of the g protein-coupled er (gper) activation in estrogen-mediated dopaminergic neuroprotection against an insult induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (mpp(+)), and whether gper neuroprotective effects involve the regulation of gdnf expression. using primary mesencephalic cultures, we found that gper activation protects dopaminergic neurons from mpp(+) toxicity in an extent similar to the promoted by a 17β-estradiol. moreover, gper activation promotes an increase in gdnf levels. both, gdnf antibody neutralization or rna interference-mediated gdnf knockdown prevented the gper-mediated dopaminergic protection verified in mesencephalic cultures challenged with mpp(+). overall, these results revealed that g1, a selective agonist of gper, is able to protect dopaminergic neurons and that gdnf overexpression is a key feature to gper induced the neuroprotective effects.  parkinson’s disease (pd) is characterised by the preferential loss of dopaminergic neurones from the substantia nigra (sn) that leads to the hallmark motor disturbances. animal and human studies suggest a beneficial effect of oestrogen to the nigrostriatal system, and the regulation of neurotrophic factor expression by oestrogens has been suggested as a possible mechanism contributing to that neuroprotective effect. the present study was designed to investigate whether the neuroprotection exerted by 17β‐oestradiol on nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones is mediated through the regulation of glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) expression. using an in vivo rat model of pd, we were able to confirm the relevance of 17β‐oestradiol in defending dopaminergic neurones against 6‐hydroxydopamine (6‐ohda) toxicity. 17β‐oestradiol, released by micro‐osmotic pumps, implanted 10 days before intrastriatal 6‐ohda injection, prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurones induced by 6‐ohda. 17β‐oestradiol treatment also promoted an increase in gdnf protein levels both in the sn and striatum. to explore the relevance of gdnf increases to 17β‐oestradiol neuroprotection, we analysed, in sn neurone‐glia cultures, the effect of gdnf antibody neutralisation and rna interference‐mediated gdnf knockdown. the results showed that both gdnf neutralisation and gdnf silencing abolished the dopaminergic protection provided by 17β‐oestradiol against 6‐ohda toxicity. taken together, these results strongly identify gdnf as an important player in 17β‐oestradiol‐mediated dopaminergic neuroprotection.
over the last decade, tremendous progress has been made toward a comparative understanding of gene regulatory evolution. however, we know little about how gene regulation evolves in birds, and how divergent genomes interact in their hybrids. because of the unique features of birds – female heterogamety, a highly conserved karyotype, and the slow evolution of reproductive incompatibilities – an understanding of regulatory evolution in birds is critical to a comprehensive understanding of regulatory evolution and its implications for speciation. using a novel complement of analyses of replicated rna-seq libraries, we demonstrate abundant divergence in brain gene expression between zebra finch (taeniopygia guttata) subspecies. by comparing parental populations and their f1 hybrids, we also show that gene misexpression is relatively rare among brain-expressed transcripts in male birds. if this pattern is consistent across tissues and sexes, it may partially explain the slow buildup of postzygotic reproductive isolation observed in birds relative to other taxa. although we expected that the action of genetic drift on the island-dwelling zebra finch subspecies would be manifested in a higher rate of trans regulatory divergence, we found that most divergence was in cis regulation, following a pattern commonly observed in other taxa. thus, our study highlights both unique and shared features of avian regulatory evolution.  genetic changes affecting gene expression contribute to phenotypic divergence; thus, understanding how regulatory networks controlling gene expression change over time is critical for understanding evolution. prior studies of expression differences within and between species have identified properties of regulatory divergence, but technical and biological differences among these studies make it difficult to assess the generality of these properties or to understand how regulatory changes accumulate with divergence time. here, we address these issues by comparing gene expression among strains and species of drosophila with a range of divergence times and use f1 hybrids to examine inheritance patterns and disentangle cis- and trans-regulatory changes. we find that the fixation of compensatory changes has caused the regulation of gene expression to diverge more rapidly than gene expression itself. specifically, we observed that the proportion of genes with evidence of cis-regulatory divergence has increased more rapidly with divergence time than the proportion of genes with evidence of expression differences. surprisingly, the amount of expression divergence explained by cis-regulatory changes did not increase steadily with divergence time, as was previously proposed. rather, one species (drosophila sechellia) showed an excess of cis-regulatory divergence that we argue most likely resulted from positive selection in this lineage. taken together, this work reveals not only the rate at which gene expression evolves, but also the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for this evolution.
abstract the herpes simplex virus (hsv) tegument protein vp1-2 contains an n-terminal nuclear localization signal (nls) that is critical for capsid routing to the nuclear pore. here we analyzed positionally conserved determinants in vp1-2 homologues from each of the alpha, beta, and gamma classes of human herpesviruses. the overall architectures of the vp1-2s were similar, with a conserved n-terminal ubiquitin-specific protease domain separated from an internal region by a linker that was quite poorly conserved in length and sequence. within this linker region all herpesviruses contained a conserved, highly basic motif which nevertheless exhibited distinct class-specific features. the motif in hsv functioned as a monopartite nls, while in varicella-zoster virus (vzv) activity required an adjacent basic section defining the motif as a bipartite nls. neither the beta- nor gammaherpesvirus vp1-2 motifs were identified by prediction algorithms, but they nevertheless functioned as efficient nls motifs both in heterologous transfer assays and in hsv vp1-2. furthermore, though with different efficiencies and with the exception of human herpesvirus 8 (hhv-8), these chimeric variants rescued the replication defect of an hsv mutant lacking its nls motif. we demonstrate that the lysine at position 428 of hsv is critical for replication, with a single alanine substitution being sufficient to abrogate nls function and virus growth. we conclude that the basic motifs of each of the vp1-2 proteins are likely to confer a similar function in capsid entry in the homologous setting and that while there is flexibility in the exact type of motif employed, specific individual residues are critical for function. importance to successfully infect cells, all herpesviruses, along with many other viruses, e.g., hiv, hepatitis b virus, and influenza virus, must navigate through the cytoplasmic environment and dock with nuclear pores for transport of their genomes into the nucleus. however, we still have a limited understanding of the detailed mechanisms involved. insight into these events is needed and could offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention. this work investigated the role of a specific determinant in the structural protein vp1-2 in herpesvirus entry. we examined this determinant in representative vp1-2s from all herpesvirus subfamilies, demonstrated nls function, dissected key residues, and showed functional relevance in rescuing replication of the mutant blocked in capsid navigation to the pore. the results are important and strongly support our conclusions of the generality that these motifs are crucial for entry of all herpesviruses. they also facilitate future analysis on selective host interactions and possible routes to disrupt function.  abstract the herpes simplex virus (hsv) tegument protein vp1-2 is essential for virus entry and assembly. vp1-2 also contains a highly conserved ubiquitin-specific protease (usp) domain within its n-terminal region. despite conservation of the usp and the demonstration that it can act on artificial substrates such as polyubiquitin chains, identification of the relevance of the usp in vivo to levels or function of any substrate remains limited. here we show that hsv vp1-2 usp can act on itself and is important for stability. vp1-2 n-terminal variants encompassing the core usp domain itself were not affected by mutation of the catalytic cysteine residue (c65). however, extending the n-terminal region resulted in protein species requiring usp activity for accumulation. in this context, c65a mutation resulted in a drastic reduction in protein levels which could be stabilized by proteosomal inhibition or by the presence of normal c65. the functional usp domain could increase abundance of unstable variants, indicating action at least in part, in trans. interestingly, full-length variants containing the inactive usp, although unstable when expressed in isolation, were stabilized by virus infection. the catalytically inactive vp1-2 retained complementation activity of a vp1-2-negative virus. furthermore, a recombinant virus expressing a c65a mutant vp1-2 exhibited little difference in single-step growth curves and the kinetics and abundance of vp1-2 or a number of test proteins. despite the absence of a phenotype for these replication parameters, the usp activity of vp1-2 may be required for function, including its own stability, under certain circumstances.
aims/hypothesisil-12 is an important cytokine in early inflammatory responses and is implicated in the immune-mediated pathogenesis of pancreatic islets in diabetes. however, little is known about the direct effects of il-12 on islets and beta cells.methodsin this study, beta cell function, gene expression and protein production were assessed in primary human donor islets and murine beta cell lines in response to stimulation with il-12 or a pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail (tnf-α, il-1β and ifn-γ).resultsthe pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail induced islet dysfunction and potently increased the expression and production of il-12 ligand and il-12 receptor in human islets. in human islets, the receptor for il-12 co-localised to the cell surface of insulin-producing cells. both il-12 ligand and il-12 receptor are expressed in the homogeneous beta cell line ins-1. il-12 induced changes in gene expression, including a dose-dependent upregulation of ifnγ (also known as ifng), in ins-1 cells. a neutralising antibody to il-12 directly inhibited ifnγ gene expression in human donor islets induced by either il-12 or pro-inflammatory cytokine stimulation. functionally, il-12 impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (gsis) in ins-1 cells and human donor islets. a neutralising antibody to il-12 reversed the beta cell dysfunction (uncoupling of gsis or induction of caspase-3 activity) induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines.conclusions/interpretationthese data identify beta cells as a local source of il-12 ligand and suggest a direct role of il-12 in mediating beta cell pathology.  to analyze the function of the th1-promoting cytokine il-12 in vivo, we generated transgenic (tg) mice (rip-il12 mice) whose pancreatic beta cells constitutively express bioactive il-12 or one of its components, p35 or p40. in contrast to non-tg littermates or single-tg rip-p35 and rip-p40 mice, rip-il12 mice developed a marked pancreatic infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages, mainly around islets. expression of bioactive il-12 primarily upregulated transcript levels of ifn-inducible protein-10 (ip-10), rantes, ifn-gamma, and tnf-alpha in the pancreas. despite the substantial recruitment of mononuclear cells, no biochemical or clinical disease was evident in the exocrine or endocrine pancreas. coexpression of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (lcmv) proteins with il-12 in the beta cells failed to spontaneously activate or expand antigen-specific anti-self/viral t cells in uninfected tg animals. however, when rip-il12 x rip-lcmv tg mice were infected with lcmv, antigen-specific anti-self/viral t cells were induced, which led to an acceleration in the kinetics and severity of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm). thus, the ectopic expression of il-12 does not spontaneously break tolerance and activate antigen-specific t cells in the periphery, but it does worsen ongoing autoimmune disease.
the body length and diameter of muscle fibres from the right hypaxial tail myomeres were measured in 100 sea bass larvae (dicentrarchus labrax, l.) at ages of 40 to 90 days, from a fish farm in croatia. the larvae were kept at a temperature of 19–20˚c and fed with standard feed for their respective ages. body lengths of larvae 40–90 days old varied from 8 to 42 mm, increasing significantly in 10-day intervals (p<0.001), except between days 50 and 60 when there was no increase in the body length. the measured diameters of muscle fibres ranged from 10 to 80 μm, the mean value increasing except between days 50 and 60. the fibre diameter in larvae aged up to 60 days was 10–40 μm, while that in larvae older than 70 days was 51–80 μm. in 90-day-old larvae there were no fibres of 10–20 μm in diameter; however, the number of fibers of 61–80 μm diameter increased. a statistically significant concordance was determined between the body length and fibre diameter of larvae 70 to 90 days old. between days 50 and 60, arrested growth of the larval body and corresponding decrease in fibre diameter was observed. from day 45 until days 59, larvae were fed with artemia nauplii and microparticles of formulated diets. from the day 60, minced fish was added to formulated diets. this change in diet probably resulted in the observed growth arrest.  two genetically different populations of sea bass, dicentrarchus labrax l., atlantic (atl.) and mediterranean (med.), were subjected to the following incubation/cultivation temperatures (t): 15 °c/natural, 17 °c/natural, 15/19 °c, 17/19 °c (natural t averaging 15 °c and raising gradually). muscle cellularity was measured at different larval stages for each t regime. during the vitelline phase, muscle growth was mainly due to muscle fibre hypertrophy. in med. larvae, higher incubation t (17 °c) increased the area of white and red fibres at hatching, while in atl. larvae there was no significant t effect at this stage. at mouth opening, the area of white fibres increased at 19 °c in atl. larvae (p<0.05), but in med. larvae it was similar for all temperatures. following yolk-sac reabsorption, hypertrophy and hyperplasia increased in both populations. in these stages (20–55 days), both parameters were greater at 19 °c (p<0.05). metamorphosis finished earlier at 19 °c. at this stage, atl. larvae reared at 19 °c showed higher value of total myotomal area than at natural t, while in med. sea bass, larvae reared at 19 °c showed a lower size of the myotome than at 17 °c/natural. in larvae from both populations reared at natural t, incubating t had a positive effect at the end of metamorphosis, thus the total myotomal area were higher at 17 °c/natural than at 15 °c/natural. following metamorphosis, all groups showed a rapid growth, but higher at 19 °c (p<0.05). the results indicate that muscle cellularity was clearly influenced by t, and that both populations had different levels of response. these differences can be apparently associated with their respective genetic background.
sodium channel nav1.7, encoded by the scn9a gene, is preferentially expressed in nociceptive primary sensory neurons, where it amplifies small depolarizations. in studies on a family with inherited erythromelalgia associated with nav1.7 gain‐of‐function mutation a863p, we identified a nonsynonymous single‐nucleotide polymorphism within scn9a in the affected proband and several unaffected family members; this polymorphism (c. 3448c&t, single nucleotide polymorphisms database rs6746030, which produces the amino acid substitution r1150w in human nav1.7 [hnav1.7]) is present in 1.1 to 12.7% of control chromosomes, depending on ethnicity. in this study, we examined the effect of the r1150w substitution on function of the hnav1.7 channel, and on the firing of dorsal root ganglion (drg) neurons in which this channel is normally expressed. we show that this polymorphism depolarizes activation (7.9–11mv in different assays). current‐clamp analysis shows that the 1150w allele depolarizes (6mv) resting membrane potential and increases (∼2‐fold) the firing frequency in response to depolarization in drg neurons in which it is present. our results suggest that polymorphisms in the nav1.7 channel may influence susceptibility to pain. ann neurol 2009;66:862–866  inherited erythromelalgia/erythermalgia (iem) is a neuropathy characterized by pain and redness of the extremities that is triggered by warmth. iem has been associated with missense mutations of the voltage-gated sodium channel nav1.7, which is preferentially expressed in most nociceptive dorsal root ganglia (drgs) and sympathetic ganglion neurons. several mutations occur in cytoplasmic linkers of nav1.7, with only two mutations in segment 4 (s4) and s6 of domain i. we report here a simplex case with an alanine 863 substitution by proline (a863p) in s5 of domain ii of nav1.7. the functional effect of a863p was investigated by voltage-clamp analysis in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and by current-clamp analysis to determine the effects of a863p on firing properties of small drg neurons. activation of mutant channels was shifted by −8 mv, whereas steady-state fast inactivation was shifted by +10 mv, compared with wild-type (wt) channels. there was a marked decrease in the rate of deactivation of mutant channels, and currents elicited by slow ramp depolarizations were 12 times larger than for wt. these results suggested that a863p could render drg neurons hyperexcitable. we tested this hypothesis by studying properties of rat drg neurons transfected with either a863p or wt channels. a863p depolarized resting potential of drg neurons by +6 mv compared with wt channels, reduced the threshold for triggering single action potentials to 63% of that for wt channels, and increased firing frequency of neurons when stimulated with suprathreshold stimuli. thus, a863p mutant channels produce hyperexcitability in drg neurons, which contributes to the pathophysiology of iem.
non-enzymatic glycation of peripheral nerve extracellular matrix (ecm) may contribute to the development of diabetic distal sensory neuropathy (dnp). we investigated the relative importance of glycation of collagen types i and iv, laminin and fibronectin in dnp-related impairment in peripheral nerve regeneration. dorsal root ganglia (drgs) from young adult mice were embedded in collagen type i modified by 10% substitution with normal or glycated forms of the proteins and incubated for 3 days. outgrowth of axons and migration of cells into the ecm were quantified. mean length of growing axons was significantly reduced by glycation of laminin and collagen type iv. the sum of lengths of all axons from each drg was greatly reduced with glycated laminin, collagen types iv and i. glycation of fibronectin had no effect on axonal growth. the number of migrating cells was not affected by glycation. we conclude that non-enzymatic glycation of laminin and collagen types iv and i (in decreasing order) impairs peripheral nerve regeneration in vitro.  abstract the pattern of collagenisation in peripheral nerve in diabetic polyneuropathy was examined in nerve biopsy specimens from patients with diabetic polyneuropathy in comparison with organ donor control nerves and disease controls (other neuropathies). there was increased endoneurial collagenisation both in the diabetic polyneuropathy cases and the disease controls, this predominantly involving types i and iii. type ii collagen was not detected in organ donor control nerves or in the diabetic and the disease control nerves. there was a relative increase in type vi collagen in the endoneurium in the diabetic nerves immediately surrounding groups of schwann cells. this was not a feature in the other neuropathies. the quantity of types iv, v and vi collagen was increased around the endoneurial microvessels in the diabetic patients and, to a lesser extent, in those with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (hmsn). increased deposition of types iv and v collagen was observed in the perineurium in the diabetic nerves, the latter being most evident in the innermost lamellae where the amount of laminin was possibly also increased. the diameter of the general endoneurial collagen fibrils was greater in the diabetic nerves, although this was not more than in a disease control (hmsn). the collagen fibrils that were present within the basal laminal tubes that had surrounded degenerated myelinated fibres in the diabetic nerves, and those within the onion bulbs of the hmsn cases, were of the normal endoneurial calibre. the expression of laminin by büngner bands in diabetic neuropathy did not differ from that in disease control nerves, nor were any differences detected for fibronectin. whether the changes observed are important for the impaired regenerative capacity in diabetic neuropathy requires further investigation.
background frataxin, the mitochondrial protein deficient in friedreich ataxia, a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder, is thought to be involved in multiple iron-dependent mitochondrial pathways. in particular, frataxin plays an important role in the formation of iron-sulfur (fe-s) clusters biogenesis. methodology/principal findings we present data providing new insights into the interactions of mammalian frataxin with the fe-s assembly complex by combining in vitro and in vivo approaches. through immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that the main endogenous interactors of a recombinant mature human frataxin are iscu, nfs1 and isd11, the components of the core fe-s assembly complex. furthemore, using a heterologous expression system, we demonstrate that mammalian frataxin interacts with the preformed core complex, rather than with the individual components. the quaternary complex can be isolated in a stable form and has a molecular mass of ≈190 kda. finally, we demonstrate that the mature human fxn81–210 form of frataxin is the essential functional form in vivo. conclusions/significance our results suggest that the interaction of frataxin with the core iscu/nfs1/isd11 complex most likely defines the essential function of frataxin. our results provide new elements important for further understanding the early steps of de novo fe-s cluster biosynthesis.  frataxin is an essential mitochondrial protein whose reduced expression causes friedreich's ataxia (frda), a lethal neurodegenerative disease. it is believed that frataxin is an iron chaperone that participates in iron metabolism. we have tested this hypothesis using the bacterial frataxin ortholog, cyay, and different biochemical and biophysical techniques. we observe that cyay participates in iron-sulfur (fe-s) cluster assembly as an iron-dependent inhibitor of cluster formation, through binding to the desulfurase iscs. the interaction with iscs involves the iron binding surface of cyay, which is conserved throughout the frataxin family. we propose that frataxins are iron sensors that act as regulators of fe-s cluster formation to fine-tune the quantity of fe-s cluster formed to the concentration of the available acceptors. our observations provide new perspectives for understanding frda and a mechanistic model that rationalizes the available knowledge on frataxin.
in mucopolysaccharidosis-i (mps-i), alpha-l-iduronidase deficiency leads to progressive heparan sulfate (hs) and dermatan sulfate (ds) glycosaminoglycan (gag) accumulation. the functional consequences of these accumulated molecules are unknown. hs critically influences tissue morphogenesis by binding to and modulating the activity of several cytokines (eg, fibroblast growth factors [fgfs]) involved in developmental patterning. we recently isolated a multipotent progenitor cell from postnatal human bone marrow, which differentiates into cells of all 3 embryonic lineages. the availability of multipotent progenitor cells from healthy volunteers and patients with mps-i (hurler syndrome) provides a unique opportunity to directly examine the functional effects of abnormal hs on cytokine-mediated stem-cell proliferation and survival. we demonstrate here that abnormally sulfated hs in hurler multipotent progenitor cells perturb critical fgf-2-fgfr1-hs interactions, resulting in defective fgf-2-induced proliferation and survival of hurler multipotent progenitor cells. both the mitogenic and survival-promoting activities of fgf-2 were restored by substitution of hurler hs by normal hs. this perturbation of critical hs-cytokine receptor interactions may represent a mechanism by which accumulated hs contributes to the developmental pathophysiology of hurler syndrome. similar mechanisms may operate in the pathogenesis of other diseases where structurally abnormal gags accumulate.  stem cell localization, conservation, and differentiation is believed to occur in niches in the marrow stromal microenvironment. our recent observation that long-term in vitro human hematopoiesis requires a stromal heparan sulfate proteoglycan (hspg) led us to hypothesize that such hspg may orchestrate the formation of the stem cell niche. we compared the structure and function of hs from m2-10b4, a hematopoiesis-supportive cell line, with hs from a nonsupportive cell line, fhs-173-we. long-term culture-initiating cell (ltc-ic) maintenance was enhanced by pg from supportive cells but not by pg from nonsupportive cells (p <.005). the supportive hs were significantly larger and more highly sulfated than the nonsupportive hs. specifically, supportive hs contained higher 6-o-sulfation on the glucosamine residues. in agreement with these observations, purified 6-o-sulfated heparin and highly 6-o-sulfated bovine kidney hs similarly maintained ltc-ic. in contrast, completely desulfated heparin, n-sulfated heparin, and unmodified heparin did not support ltc-ic maintenance. moreover, the supportive hs promoted ltc-ic maintenance but not differentiation of cd34(+)/hla-dr- cells into colony-forming cells (cfcs) and mature blood cells. the supportive hs but not the nonsupportive hs bound both cytokines and matrix components critical for hematopoiesis, including interleukin-3 (il-3), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (mip-1), and thrombospondin (tsp). significantly more cd34(+) cells adhered directly to immobilized o-sulfated heparin than to n-sulfated or desulfated heparin. thus, hematopoiesis-supportive stromal hspg possessing large, highly 6-o-sulfated hs mediate the juxtaposition of hematopoietic progenitors with stromal cells, specific growth-promoting (il-3) and growth-inhibitory (mip-1 and platelet factor 4 [pf4]) cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins such as tsp. we conclude that the structural specificity of stromal hspg that determines the selective colocalization of cytokines and ecm components leads to the formation of discrete niches, thereby orchestrating the controlled growth and differentiation of stem cells. these findings may have important implications for ex vivo expansion of and gene transfer into primitive hematopoietic progenitors.
this methods-oriented paper introduces visual methods and specifically photography to study immediate information space (lee, 2003); that is, information-rich settings such as offices or homes. it draws upon the authors' firsthand ethnographic field experiences, a review of relevant theoretical and methodological literature, and an analysis of cases within information studies that have made use of visual and photographic techniques. to begin, the traditions of visual research within anthropology and sociology are traced and major epistemological, methodological, and disciplinary debates associated with visual scholarship are presented. then, investigations of immediate information space that utilize photography are analyzed, including examples from the areas of personal information management, health informatics, information behavior, and computer-supported cooperative work. moreover, a section entitled “applying photographic techniques…” supplies guidelines for employing photography in a research design, as well as a question-based research framework and tips for photographing information phenomena. © 2011 wiley periodicals, inc.  as an ethnographic research method, observation has a long history. the value of observation is that it permits researchers to study people in their native environment in order to understand "things" from their perspective. observation requires the researcher to spend considerable time in the field with the possibility of adopting various roles in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the people being studied. a variety of techniques are used to collect data. gaining access to the group and leaving the field are two important factors that need consideration. other areas of concern involve ethical problems, as well as validity and reliability issues. until recently, few library and information science (lis) studies have included this method; however, observation is gaining favor as lis researchers seek to understand better the role of information in people's everyday lives.
antibiotics were very important pieces of the puzzle that enabled the poultry production to move from a backyard flock based industry to the large-scale production facilities of today. public health professionals have suggested that the use of subtherapeutic antibiotics in animal production may be partially responsible for the development of antibiotic resistant bacterial populations. the probiotics may be substituted by antibiotics (growth promoting) in certain cases. pediococcus acidilactici is a bacterial probiotic used in this experience. 16000 broiler chickens were assigned in two experimental groups: treatment (109 cfu/kg of feed of pediococcus acidilactici ma18/5m) and control. in each group 8000 broiler chickens were allocated in the same batch and divided by a physical barrier. individual live weight of a sample of 200 birds for each group from day 0 to day 56 was measured weekly. feed intake, feed efficiency, mortality, carcass quality, serum lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) and number of white blood cells, were recorded per group. the administration of pediococcus acidilactici affected positively the growth performance of broilers (2586.43 vs. 2252.79 g, p≤0.01) and feed conversion ratio (2.00 vs. 2.5). there were no significant difference between groups in dressing, breast meat and thigh percent, at the end of day 56. analysis of variance showed significant difference between treatments for serum lipids (p≤0.01). mortality was almost similar in both groups (6.56 vs. 6.51). the numbers of white blood cells were significantly affected by dietary treatment (p≤0.01).  1. the effects of a mixture of 12 lactobacillus strains (lc) on the growth performance, abdominal fat deposition, serum lipids and weight of organs of broiler chickens were studied from 1 to 42 d of age. 2. one hundred and thirty-six 1-d-old male broiler chicks were assigned at random to two dietary treatments: a basal diet (control), and a basal diet with 0·1% lc. 3. the supplementation of lc in broiler diets improved the body weight gain and feed conversion rate from 1 to 42 d of age and was effective in reducing abdominal fat deposition but only after 28 d of age. 4. the lc diets reduced serum total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol and triglycerides in broilers from 21 to 42 d of age. however, there was no significant difference in serum high density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol between control and lc-fed broilers. there was also no significant difference in the weights of organs of control and lc-fed broilers. 5. the results indicated that the mixture of 12 lactobacillus strains have a hypolipidaemic effect on broilers.
we introduce a multi-distance, frequency-domain, near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) method to measure the optical coefficients of two-layered media and the thickness of the top layer from diffuse reflectance measurements. this method features a direct solution based on diffusion theory and an inversion procedure based on the levenberg-marquardt algorithm. we have validated our method through monte carlo simulations, experiments on tissue-like phantoms, and measurements on the forehead of three human subjects. the monte carlo simulations and phantom measurements have shown that, in ideal two-layered samples, our method accurately recovers the top layer thickness (l), the absorption coefficient (µa) and the reduced scattering coefficient (µ′s) of both layers with deviations that are typically less than 10% for all parameters. our method is aimed at absolute measurements of hemoglobin concentration and saturation in cerebral and extracerebral tissue of adult human subjects, where the top layer (layer 1) represents extracerebral tissue (scalp, skull, dura mater, subarachnoid space, etc.) and the bottom layer (layer 2) represents cerebral tissue. human subject measurements have shown a significantly greater total hemoglobin concentration in cerebral tissue (82±14 µm) with respect to extracerebral tissue (30±7 µm). by contrast, there was no significant difference between the hemoglobin saturation measured in cerebral tissue (56%±10%) and extracerebral tissue (62%±6%). to our knowledge, this is the first time that an inversion procedure in the frequency domain with six unknown parameters with no other prior knowledge is used for the retrieval of the optical coefficients and top layer thickness with high accuracy on two-layered media. our absolute measurements of cerebral hemoglobin concentration and saturation are based on the discrimination of extracerebral and cerebral tissue layers, and they can enhance the impact of nirs for cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation assessment both in the research arena and clinical practice.  we present near-infrared spectroscopy measurement of absolute cerebral hemoglobin concentration and saturation in a large sample of 36 healthy elderly (mean age, 85 ± 6 years) and 19 young adults (mean age, 28 ± 4 years). non-invasive measurements were obtained on the forehead using a commercially available multi-distance frequency-domain system and analyzed using a diffusion theory model for a semi-infinite, homogeneous medium with semi-infinite boundary conditions. our study included repeat measurements, taken five months apart, on 16 elderly volunteers that demonstrate intra-subject reproducibility of the absolute measurements with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.9 for absorption coefficient (μa), oxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hbo2]), and total hemoglobin concentration ([hbt]), 0.7 for deoxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hb]), 0.8 for hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sto2), and 0.7 for reduced scattering coefficient (μ's). we found significant differences between the two age groups. compared to young subjects, elderly subjects had lower cerebral [hbo2], [hb], [hbt], and sto2 by 10 ± 4 μm, 4 ± 3 μm, 14 ± 5 μm, and 6%±5%, respectively. our results demonstrate the reliability and robustness of multi-distance near-infrared spectroscopy measurements based on a homogeneous model in the human forehead on a large sample of human subjects. absolute, non-invasive optical measurements on the brain, such as those presented here, can significantly advance the development of nirs technology as a tool for monitoring resting/basal cerebral perfusion, hemodynamics, oxygenation, and metabolism.
significance traf6 is essential for many biological processes, including the operation of the innate immune system and bone formation. the enzymatic activity of traf6, an e3 ubiquitin ligase, is thought to have a pivotal role in triggering these processes. in this paper, we reexamined this assumption by generating mice expressing a catalytically inactive mutant of traf6. the bone structure of the mice was normal and a major intracellular signaling pathway of the immune system could still be switched on. we found that other e3 ligases, pellino1 and pellino2, could generate the ubiquitin chains needed to switch on immune signaling in human cells expressing catalytically inactive traf6. our findings identify essential roles of traf6 that are independent of its enzymatic activity. it is widely accepted that the essential role of traf6 in vivo is to generate the lys63-linked ubiquitin (k63-ub) chains needed to activate the “master” protein kinase tak1. here, we report that traf6 e3 ligase activity contributes to but is not essential for the il-1–dependent formation of k63-ub chains, tak1 activation, or il-8 production in human cells, because pellino1 and pellino2 generate the k63-ub chains required for signaling in cells expressing e3 ligase-inactive traf6 mutants. the il-1–induced formation of k63-ub chains and ubiquitylation of irak1, irak4, and myd88 was abolished in traf6/pellino1/pellino2 triple-knockout (ko) cells, but not in traf6 ko or pellino1/2 double-ko cells. the reexpression of e3 ligase-inactive traf6 mutants partially restored il-1 signaling in traf6 ko cells, but not in traf6/pellino1/pellino2 triple-ko cells. pellino1-generated k63-ub chains activated the tak1 complex in vitro with similar efficiently to traf6-generated k63-ub chains. the early phase of tlr signaling and the tlr-dependent secretion of il-10 (controlled by iraks 1 and 2) was only reduced modestly in primary macrophages from knockin mice expressing the e3 ligase-inactive traf6[l74h] mutant, but the late-phase production of il-6, il-12, and tnfα (controlled only by the pseudokinase irak2) was abolished. rankl-induced signaling in macrophages and the differentiation of bone marrow to osteoclasts was similar in traf6[l74h] and wild-type cells, explaining why the bone structure and teeth of the traf6[l74h] mice was normal, unlike traf6 ko mice. we identify two essential roles of traf6 that are independent of its e3 ligase activity.  tumor necrosis factor (tnf) receptor–associated factor (traf)-6 mediates lys63-linked polyubiquitination for nf-κb activation via its n-terminal ring and zinc finger domains. here we report the crystal structures of traf6 and its complex with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e2) ubc13. the ring and zinc fingers of traf6 assume a rigid, elongated structure. interaction of traf6 with ubc13 involves direct contacts of the ring and the preceding residues, and the first zinc finger has a structural role. unexpectedly, this region of traf6 is dimeric both in the crystal and in solution, different from the trimeric c-terminal traf domain. structure-based mutagenesis reveals that traf6 dimerization is crucial for polyubiquitin synthesis and autoubiquitination. fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis shows that traf6 dimerization induces higher-order oligomerization of full-length traf6. the mismatch of dimeric and trimeric symmetry may provide a mode of infinite oligomerization that facilitates ligand-dependent signal transduction of many immune receptors.
infection with genus beta human papillomaviruses (hpv) is implicated in the development of non-melanoma skin cancer. this was first evidenced for hpv5 and 8 in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (ev), a genetic skin disease. so far, it has been unknown how these viruses overcome cutaneous immune control allowing their persistence in lesional epidermis of these patients. here we demonstrate that langerhans cells, essential for skin immunosurveillance, are strongly reduced in hpv8-positive lesional epidermis from ev patients. interestingly, the same lesions were largely devoid of the important langerhans cells chemoattractant protein ccl20. applying bioinformatic tools, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and functional studies we identified the differentiation-associated transcription factor ccaat/enhancer binding protein β (c/ebpβ) as a critical regulator of ccl20 gene expression in normal human keratinocytes. the physiological relevance of this finding is supported by our in vivo studies showing that the expression patterns of ccl20 and nuclear c/ebpβ converge spatially in the most differentiated layers of human epidermis. our analyses further identified c/ebpβ as a novel target of the hpv8 e7 oncoprotein, which co-localizes with c/ebpβ in the nucleus, co-precipitates with it and interferes with its binding to the ccl20 promoter in vivo. as a consequence, the hpv8 e7 but not e6 oncoprotein suppressed c/ebpβ-inducible and constitutive ccl20 gene expression as well as langerhans cell migration. in conclusion, our study unraveled a novel molecular mechanism central to cutaneous host defense. interference of the hpv8 e7 oncoprotein with this regulatory pathway allows the virus to disrupt the immune barrier, a major prerequisite for its epithelial persistence and procarcinogenic activity.  most nuclear proteins reside on a specific chromatin site only for seconds or less. the hit-and-run model of transcriptional control maintains that transcription complexes are assembled in a stochastic fashion from freely diffusible proteins; this contrasts to models involving stepwise assembly of stable holo complexes. however, the chances of forming a productive complex improve if the binding of one factor promotes the binding of its interactors. we prove here that in living cells, the glucocorticoid receptor and hmgb1 interact only within chromatin and not in the nucleoplasm and decrease each other's mobility. thus, the formation of a gr-hmgb1-chromatin complex is more likely than one would expect from independent binding to chromatin of gr and hmgb1. remarkably, this complex is potentially stable, and its disassembly is effected by active, atp-consuming processes. we propose that kinetic cooperativity among transcription factors in chromatin binding may be a common feature in transcription and dna transactions.
objective. to evaluate the performance of sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) score in cases of severe maternal morbidity (smm). design. retrospective study of diagnostic validation. setting. an obstetric intensive care unit (icu) in brazil. population. 673 women with smm. main outcome measures. mortality and sofa score. methods. organ failure was evaluated according to maximum score for each one of its six components. the total maximum sofa score was calculated using the poorest result of each component, reflecting the maximum degree of alteration in systemic organ function. results. highest total maximum sofa score was associated with mortality, 12.06 ± 5.47 for women who died and 1.87 ± 2.56 for survivors. there was also a significant correlation between the number of failing organs and maternal mortality, ranging from 0.2% (no failure) to 85.7% (≥3 organs). analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve (auc) confirmed the excellent performance of total maximum sofa score for cases of smm (auc = 0.958). conclusions. total maximum sofa score proved to be an effective tool for evaluating severity and estimating prognosis in cases of smm. maximum sofa score may be used to conceptually define and stratify the degree of severity in cases of smm.  study objectives to determine the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs) and organ failure and to describe the outcomes in critically ill obstetric patients who have been treated in medical icus.   design retrospective review.   setting a multidisciplinary icu at a tertiary-care institution.   methods we collected data on 74 obstetric patients who were admitted consecutively to the icu from january 1991 through december 1998. acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii scores were calculated. a p value < 0.05 was considered to be significant.   measurements and results fifty-eight percent of patients were admitted to the icu postpartum. their mean (+/- sd) age was 25.9 +/- 7.0 years, and 64% were african american and 34% were white. fifty percent had preexisting medical conditions. their mean apache ii score was 14.0 +/- 5.9, and their predicted mortality rate was 17.6%. the most common reason for admission was respiratory insufficiency. preeclampsia was present in 38% of patients, and hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome were present in 7% of patients. sirs developed in 59% of patients. patients with sirs had longer icu stays (p = 0.0008). organ failure developed in 65% of patients, and ards developed in 15% of patients. invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 45% of patients, and pulmonary artery catheterization was required in 35% of patients. the in-hospital mortality rate was 2.7%. there were five spontaneous abortions and eight perinatal deaths.   conclusions the most common reason for admission to the icu of critically ill obstetric patients was respiratory failure. despite the severity of illness and the development of sirs and organ failure in most patients, the mortality rate was low.
scn8a is a major neuronal sodium channel gene expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. mutations of scn8a result in movement disorders and impaired cognition. to investigate the basis for the tissue-specific expression of scn8a, we located conserved, potentially regulatory sequences in the human, mouse, chicken, and fish genes by 5′ race of brain rna and genomic sequence comparison. a highly conserved 5′ noncoding exon, exon 1c, is present in vertebrates from fish to mammals and appears to define the ancestral promoter region. the distance from exon 1c to the first coding exon increased tenfold during vertebrate evolution, largely by insertion of repetitive elements. the mammalian gene acquired three novel, mutually exclusive noncoding exons that are not represented in the lower vertebrates. within the shared exon 1c, we identified four short sequence elements of 10-20 bp with an unusually high level of evolutionary conservation. the conserved elements are most similar to consensus sites for the transcription factors pou6f1/brn5, yy1, and rest/nrsf. introduction of mutations into the predicted pou6f1 and rest sites reduced promoter activity in transfected neuronal cells. a 470-bp promoter fragment containing all of the conserved elements directed brain-specific expression of the lacz reporter in transgenic mice. transgene expression was highest in hippocampal neurons and cerebellar purkinje cells, consistent with the expression of the endogenous gene. the compact cluster of conserved regulatory elements in scn8a provides a useful target for molecular analysis of neuronal gene expression.  to identify the transcriptional start sites of the neuronal channel scn8a, we carried out 5'-race (rapid amplification of cdna ends) with rna from human and mouse brain. we recovered four mutually exclusive 5'-untranslated exons (exon 1a to exon 1d) that map to a 1.8-kb region of genomic dna located approximately 70 kb upstream of the first coding exon. the same 5'-untranslated exons are expressed in central, peripheral and sympathetic nervous system and in embryonic and adult brain. a 4.8-kb genomic fragment containing these 5' exons demonstrated promoter activity in transfected mn-1 cells. in transgenic mice, transcription of the 4.8-kb promoter was restricted to brain and spinal cord. the 4.8-kb promoter contains eight consensus sp1-binding sites and two inr sites. a potential nrse/re-1 site is located nearby. two active polyadenylation sites identified by 3'-race are conserved in human, mouse, and chicken scn8a. sequence comparison of human and mouse scn8a identified 12 conserved noncoding elements whose effect on transcription was tested in transfected cells.
holospora obtusa is a macronucleus-specific endosymbiotic bacterium of the ciliate paramecium caudatum. we report the secretion of a 63-kda periplasmic protein of an infectious form of the bacterium into the macronucleus of its host. indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with five monoclonal antibodies against the 63-kda protein demonstrated that, soon after the bacterial invasion into the host macronucleus, the protein was detected in the infected macronucleus and that levels of the protein increased dramatically within one day of infection. the use of inhibitors for host and bacterial protein synthesis illustrated that, in early infection of h. obtusa, not only the pre-existing but also a newly synthesized 63-kda protein was secreted into the host macronucleus. a partial amino acid sequence of the protein was determined, and a gene encoding the 63-kda protein was cloned. the deduced amino acid sequence shows that this protein is a novel protein.  the symbiotic bacterium holospora obtusa infects the macronucleus of the ciliate paramecium caudatum. after ingestion by its host, an infectious form of holospora with an electron-translucent tip passes through the host digestive vacuole and penetrates the macronuclear envelope with this tip. to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of this process, we raised a monoclonal antibody against the tip-specific 89-kda protein, sequenced this partially, and identified the corresponding complete gene. the deduced protein sequence carries two actin-binding motifs. indirect immunofluorescence microscopy shows that during escape from the host digestive vacuole, the 89-kda proteins translocates from the inside to the outside of the tip. when the bacterium invades the macronucleus, the 89-kda protein is left behind at the entry point of the nuclear envelope. transmission electron microscopy shows the formation of fine fibrous structures that co-localize with the antibody-labeled regions of the bacterium. our findings suggest that the 89-kda protein plays a role in holospora's escape from the host digestive vacuole, the migration through the host cytoplasm, and the invasion into the macronucleus.
abstract hypertensive crisis is a common clinical situation that presents a high rate of morbidity and mortality and it is characterized by symptomatic rise of blood pressure (bp), systolic (sbp) ≥ 180 mmhg and/or diastolic (dbp) ≥ 120 mmhg. it is classified as emergency (he) or hypertensive urgency (hu). there is no description of laboratory findings in patients who present acute bp elevation. thus, this study had the objective to assess the biochemical-metabolic parameters of patients with hc. we studied 74 normotensive individuals (nt), 74 controlled hypertensive patients (contrht), 50 subjects with hu, and 78 with he for evaluating biochemical-metabolic parameters. he occurs in older individuals and more frequently in those with known hypertension. more patients with he had dyslipidemia than those with hu (58% vs. 38%). the diastolic bp and heart rate were higher in the he group (120 mmhg and 87 bpm) compared to contrht (71 mmhg and 71 bpm; p < 0.0001) and nt groups (75 mmhg and 68 bpm; p < 0.0001). glycemia was higher in he vs. nt and contrht (p < 0.05). hdl cholesterol was lower in he than nt (p = 0.0088). potassium was lower in he vs. nt, contrht and hu groups (p < 0.05). creatinine was higher in the hc group vs. nt and contrht (p < 0.05). the gfr was significantly lower in he group vs. hu, contrht and nt (p < 0.001). in conclusion, individuals with hc show biochemical alterations when compared to contrht and nt. acute bp elevations are associated with hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and higher potassium and creatinine levels and lower renal function. abbreviations bmi = body mass indexbp = blood pressurech = hypertensive crisiscontrht = controlled hypertensivedbp = diastolic blood pressuregfr = glomerular filtration ratehba1c = glycated hemoglobinhdlc = high-density lipoprotein cholesterolhe = hypertensive emergencyhplc = high-performance liquid chromatographyhr = heart ratehu = hypertensive urgencyjnc 7 = vii joint national committee on the detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressureldlc = low-density lipoprotein cholesterolmdrd = modification of diet in renal diseasent = normotensiverasb = renin-angiotensin system blockerssbp = systolic blood pressuretc = total cholesteroltg = triglycerides  background the available studies have not fully analyzed the several factors involved in the genesis of hypertension (ht), especially the association among blood pressure, urinary sodium excretion and renal dysfunction.   objective to assess the ht prevalence and risk factors in different age groups in a representative sample of an urban brazilian population.   methods the studied population (1717 adult individuals) was evaluated by age groups: 18 to 39 years; 40 to 49; 50 to 59; 60 to 69 and > 70 years. quantitative variable means and categorical variables of the hypertensive and normotensive groups were compared.   results the adjusted overall prevalence of ht was 25.23%. the prevalence increased with age and was higher in individuals with low educational level. increased body mass index and abdominal waist were positively related to a higher prevalence of ht. there was a significant positive association between ht and urinary sodium excretion. hypertensive individuals presented higher frequency of renal dysfunction, defined as measured creatinine clearance <60 ml/min/m(2). the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 5.6% in the overall population and 14.5% in hypertensive individuals. hypertension was a known condition to 74.4% of the hypertensive individuals. among treated hypertensive individuals, 52.4% achieved controlled blood pressure and only 34.3% of the overall hypertensive patients (treated or not) had blood pressure controlled.   conclusion this population-based is unique by gathering different demographic, epidemiologic and risk factors involved in the genesis of hypertension in a single sample assessment with a population calculation, which might be extrapolated to other hypertensive populations.
endogenous androgens have been suggested as determinants of risk of prostatic cancer. to examine this possibility, baseline sex hormone levels were measured in 1008 men ages 40-79 years who had been followed for 14 years. there were 31 incident cases of prostatic cancer and 26 identified from death certificates with unknown dates of diagnosis. in this study, total testosterone, estrone, estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin were not related to prostate cancer, but plasma androstenedione showed a positive dose-response gradient. age-adjusted relative risks of prostatic cancer for low (0-2.2 nm), middle (2.3-3.1 nm), and high (3.2+ nm) tertiles of androstenedione were 1.00, 1.34, and 1.98, respectively (p trend less than 0.05). the linear gradient of risk persisted after adjustment for age and body mass index. if confirmed, these data suggest that androstenedione might increase the occurrence of clinically manifest prostatic cancer.  plasma testosterone, androstenedione, oestradiol-17beta, follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) and luteinizing hormone (lh) were not significantly different in patients with prostatic cancer, with benign prostatic hyperplasia or in patients without prostatic disease. plasma prolactin concentrations were significantly lower in the patients with benign disease than those with prostatic carcinoma. endocrine therapy in the form of stilboestrol administration significantly decreased plasma levels of testosterone, oestradiol-17beta, fsh and lh within 7 days of the treatment. after 7 days therapy prolactin levels increased significantly in all patients studied. changes in growth hormone concentrations were more varied in response to stilboestrol, being elevated in several patients and remaining unchanged in others. treatment of a few prostatic carcinoma patients who were receiving stilboestrol therapy with cb154, an inhibitor of prolactin secretion, brought an immediate decrease in prolactin levels which was was sustained. plasma testosterone, androstenedione and growth hormone were unchanged in these patients but a significant decrease in plasma oestradiol-17beta was noted in two patients during cb154 administration.
purpose          the purpose of this study is to analyse and explore the characteristics of patent–paper pairs (ppps) in the field of fuel cells.          design/methodology/approach          the authors used bibliometric analysis to analyse the bibliometric records of ppps identified from 20,758 papers and 8,112 utility patents between 1991 and 2010.          findings          the findings show that the percentages of papers and patents constituting ppps were low, but an increasing trend was identified in the absolute number of ppps. researchers affiliated with research institutions were the primary contributors to ppps. countries with the most papers and patents had the most ppps, exploiting the advantage of dual knowledge creation. similar growth trends were observed in the numbers of patents approved and papers published. patents in ppps were typically produced earlier than the papers in ppps. on average, patents were applied for approximately four years before papers were published, and patents were approved only approximately four months before papers were published.          research limitations/implications          while the study was limited to the ppps in the field of fuel cells, ppps analysis can be applied to numerous fields.          originality/value          ppps indicate the coactivity of researchers involved in publishing and patenting. although this coactivity has been studied, few studies have investigated ppps. this study helps us better understand the characteristics of papers and patents constituting ppps, changes in the annual numbers of papers and patents constituting ppps, delays between papers and patents, as well as individuals, institutions and countries producing numerous ppps.  we examine the influence of faculty patenting activity on the rate, quality, and content of public research outputs in a panel dataset spanning the careers of 3,862 academic life scientists. using inverse probability of treatment weights (iptw) to account for the dynamics of self-selection into patenting, we find that patenting has a positive effect on the rate of publication of journal articles, but no effect on the quality of these publications. using several measures of the "patentability" of the content of research papers, we also find that patenters may be shifting their research focus to questions of commercial interest. we conclude that the often-voiced concern that patenting in academe has a nefarious effect on public research output is, at least in its simplest form, misplaced.
omnigraph, a novel representation to support a range of nlp classification tasks, integrates lexical items, syntactic dependencies and frame semantic parses into graphs. feature engineering is folded into the learning through convolution graph kernel learning to explore different extents of the graph. a high-dimensional space of features includes individual nodes to complex networks. in experiments on a text-forecasting problem that predicts stock price change from news for company mentions, omnigraph beats several benchmarks based on bag-of-words, syntactic dependencies, and semantic trees. the highly expressive features omnigraph discovers provide insights into the semantics across distinct market sectors. to demonstrate the method’s generality, we also report its high performance results on a fine-grained sentiment corpus.  after presenting a novel o(n3) parsing algorithm for dependency grammar, we develop three contrasting ways to stochasticize it. we propose (a) a lexical affinity model where words struggle to modify each other, (b) a sense tagging model where words fluctuate randomly in their selectional preferences, and (c) a generative model where the speaker fleshes out each word's syntactic and conceptual structure without regard to the implications for the hearer. we also give preliminary empirical results from evaluating the three models' parsing performance on annotated wall street journal training text (derived from the penn treebank). in these results, the generative model performs significantly better than the others, and does about equally well at assigning part-of-speech tags.
many real world optimization problems are dynamic in which the fitness landscape is time dependent and the optima change over time. such problems challenge traditional optimization algorithms. for such problems, optimization algorithms not only have to find the global optimum but also need to closely track its trajectory. in this paper, a new hybrid algorithm integrating a differential evolution (de) and a particle swarm optimization (pso) is proposed for dynamic optimization problems. multi-population strategy is adopted to enhance the diversity and try to keep each subpopulation on a different peak in the fitness landscape. a hybrid operator combining de and pso is designed, in which each individual is sequentially carried out de and pso operations. an exclusion scheme is proposed that integrates the distance based exclusion scheme with the hill-valley function to track the adjacent peaks. the algorithm is applied to the set of benchmark functions used in cec 2009 competition for dynamic environment. experimental results show that it is more effective in terms of overall performance than other comparative algorithms.  evolutionary algorithms (eas) are widely used to deal with optimization problems in dynamic environments (de) [3]. when using eas to solve de problems, we are usually interested in the algorithm's ability to adapt and recover from the changes. one of the main problems facing an evolutionary method when solving de problems is the loss of genetic diversity.in this paper, we investigate the use of evolutionary multi-objective optimization methods (emos) for single-objective de problems. for that purpose, we introduce an artificial second objective with the aim to maintain useful diversity in the population. six different artificial objectives are examined and compared.all the results will be compared against a traditional ga and the random immigrants algorithm[4]. nsga2 is employed as the evolutionary multi-objective technique.
the inhibitory control of prepotent action is vital for appropriate behaviour. an example of the importance of such control can be seen in the inhibition of aggressive behavior, deficits in which may have broader consequences for society. many studies have related lesions or the under-development of the prefrontal cortex to inefficiency of inhibitory control. here we used transcranial magnetic stimulation and a stop-signal task, which occasionally requires the inhibition of a prepotent motor response, to investigate the role of pre-supplementary motor area (pre-sma) in inhibitory control. while no effects were seen on the ability to generate responses, tms delivered over the pre-sma disrupted the ability to respond to a stop signal. these results are the first to establish a casual link between pre-sma and inhibitory control in normal subjects. the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control may lead to clearer understanding of the neural basis of inappropriate behaviour.  intelligent behavior depends on the ability to suppress inappropriate actions and resolve interference between competing responses. recent clinical and neuroimaging evidence has demonstrated the involvement of prefrontal, parietal, and premotor areas during behaviors that emphasize conflict and inhibition. it remains unclear, however, whether discrete subregions within this network are crucial for overseeing more specific inhibitory demands. here we probed the functional specialization of human prefrontal cortex by combining repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) with integrated behavioral measures of response inhibition (stop-signal task) and response competition (flanker task). participants undertook a combined stop-signal/flanker task after rtms of the inferior frontal gyrus (ifg) or dorsal premotor cortex (dpm) in each hemisphere. stimulation of the right ifg impaired stop-signal inhibition under conditions of heightened response competition but did not influence the ability to suppress a competing response. in contrast, stimulation of the right dpm facilitated execution but had no effect on inhibition. neither of these results was observed during rtms of corresponding left-hemisphere regions. overall, our findings are consistent with existing evidence that the right ifg is crucial for inhibitory control. the observed double dissociation of neurodisruptive effects between the right ifg and right dpm further implies that response inhibition and execution rely on distinct neural processes despite activating a common cortical network.
backgroundmortality outcomes in trials of low-dose computed tomography (ct) screening for lung cancer are inconsistent. this study aimed to evaluate whether ct screening in urban areas of china could reduce lung cancer mortality and to investigate the factors that associate with the screening effect.methodsa decision tree model with three scenarios (low-dose ct screening, chest x-ray screening, and no screening) was developed to compare screening results in a simulated chinese urban cohort (100,000 smokers aged 45–80 years). data of participant characteristics were obtained from national registries and epidemiological surveys for estimating lung cancer prevalence. the selection of other tree variables such as sensitivities and specificities of low-dose ct and chest x-ray screening were based on literature research. differences in lung cancer mortality (primary outcome), false diagnoses, and deaths due to false diagnosis were calculated. sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the factors that associate with the screening results and to ascertain worst and optimal screening effects considering possible ranges of the variables.resultsamong the 100,000 subjects, there were 448, 541, and 591 lung cancer deaths in the low-dose ct, chest x-ray, and no screening scenarios, respectively (17.2% reduction in low-dose ct screening over chest x-ray screening and 24.2% over no screening). the costs of the two screening scenarios were 9387 and 2497 false diagnoses and 7 and 2 deaths due to false diagnosis among the 100,000 persons, respectively. the factors that most influenced death reduction with low-dose ct screening over no screening were lung cancer prevalence in the screened cohort, low-dose ct sensitivity, and proportion of early-stage cancers among low-dose ct detected lung cancers. considering all possibilities, reduction in deaths (relative numbers) with low-dose ct screening in the worst and optimal cases were 16 (5.4%) and 288 (40.2%) over no screening, respectively.conclusionsin terms of mortality outcomes, our findings favor conducting low-dose ct screening in urban china. however, approaches to reducing false diagnoses and optimizing important screening conditions such as enrollment criteria for screening are highly needed.  background the aggressive and heterogeneous nature of lung cancer has thwarted efforts to reduce mortality from this cancer through the use of screening. the advent of low-dose helical computed tomography (ct) altered the landscape of lung-cancer screening, with studies indicating that low-dose ct detects many tumors at early stages. the national lung screening trial (nlst) was conducted to determine whether screening with low-dose ct could reduce mortality from lung cancer.   methods from august 2002 through april 2004, we enrolled 53,454 persons at high risk for lung cancer at 33 u.s. medical centers. participants were randomly assigned to undergo three annual screenings with either low-dose ct (26,722 participants) or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography (26,732). data were collected on cases of lung cancer and deaths from lung cancer that occurred through december 31, 2009.   results the rate of adherence to screening was more than 90%. the rate of positive screening tests was 24.2% with low-dose ct and 6.9% with radiography over all three rounds. a total of 96.4% of the positive screening results in the low-dose ct group and 94.5% in the radiography group were false positive results. the incidence of lung cancer was 645 cases per 100,000 person-years (1060 cancers) in the low-dose ct group, as compared with 572 cases per 100,000 person-years (941 cancers) in the radiography group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.03 to 1.23). there were 247 deaths from lung cancer per 100,000 person-years in the low-dose ct group and 309 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the radiography group, representing a relative reduction in mortality from lung cancer with low-dose ct screening of 20.0% (95% ci, 6.8 to 26.7; p=0.004). the rate of death from any cause was reduced in the low-dose ct group, as compared with the radiography group, by 6.7% (95% ci, 1.2 to 13.6; p=0.02).   conclusions screening with the use of low-dose ct reduces mortality from lung cancer.

behavioral studies proposed that prosodic information in speech sounds plays important roles for human infants to acquire their native languages. here, we examined the neural basis of prosodic processing in 3-month-old infants. in order to obtain hemodynamic responses with high signal-to-noise ratio, we used near-infrared optical topography in the infants while they were in quiet sleep. first, we observed bilateral activation under each of the normal and flattened speech conditions. the flattened speech sound was created by eliminating changes in the pitch contours of the original utterance. in a direct comparison between the two conditions, the right temporoparietal region showed more prominent activation to normal speech sounds than to flattened speech sounds. this result demonstrates that the localized region of the right hemisphere in 3-month-old infant is involved in the processing of pitch contours. our findings suggest that prosodic processing in the right hemisphere may facilitate the acquisition of lexical or syntactic knowledge in the early stages of language development.  we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) to characterize cortical activation associated with sentence processing, thereby elucidating where in the brain auditory and visual inputs of words converge during sentence comprehension. within one scanning session, subjects performed three types of tasks with different linguistic components from perception to sentence comprehension: nonword (n(av); auditory and visual), phrase (p; either auditory or visual), and sentence (s; either auditory or visual) tasks. in a comparison of the p and n(av) tasks, the angular and supramarginal gyri showed bilateral activation, whereas the inferior and middle frontal gyri showed left-lateralized activation. a comparison of the s and p tasks, together with a conjunction analysis, revealed a ventral region of the left inferior frontal gyrus (f3t/f3o), which was sentence-processing selective and modality-independent. these results unequivocally demonstrated that the left f3t/f3o is involved in the selection and integration of semantic information that are separable from lexico-semantic processing.
1. abstract organizations often use standardized practices as a means to improve knowledge management. we suggest that the use of standardization for km efforts can take on two different forms. in one form, standardization explicates tacit knowledge in order to more effectively transfer knowledge within the organization. in the second form, standardization provides a tool to evaluate and capture knowledge. the type of employee, the impact on the organization and the measurement of system effectiveness are contingent upon the form of standardization employed. this paper summarizes our preliminary findings from a case study exploring an implementation of a standardized project management methodology at a multinational technology services company.  if research is like a football game, then the first thing new players can expect to do is to learn some of the rules of the game and then to become skilled in playing the game according to these rules. a well-defined set of rules is a great advantage to novices and to seasoned players. in doing quantitative research, the rules are clear. to researchers trained in these methods, it may therefore come as a surprise to find that there exists a variation of the research game in which there are no fixed rules but only general principles. the position of the goal posts, for example, may be different for different games and may even be moved in the course of a game. some novices may see this as presenting the opportunity for a glorious free-for-all, releasing them from the constraints of the quantitative research game. in the midst of their new-found freedom, they may then find themselves accosted by experienced players who seem to have, after all, a definite set of rules. on being challenged, experienced players may then explain that, while there are only general principles, these are interpreted in a quite specific way depending on the particular context within which the game is being played. 'context' becomes the bugbear for the novice. the novice may even have to learn that, before booting the ball through the goal posts, the player has to take account of where the ball is coming from, where it wants to go and what meaning it, the ball, attaches to the experience of being kicked! freedom readily gives way to frustration and incomprehension. happily, there are some brave researchers who set about the task of making the rules of qualitative research explicit to novices and to experienced players. the three books reviewed here fall into that category. they all take on a different task. the collection of articles brought together in one edition by janice morse is not about the rules but about some exciting games that have been played. together the articles demonstrate not only the pleasures of the qualitative research game, but also its contribution to a fine, detailed understanding of important health prob-
dehydrins (dhns) define a complex group of stress inducible proteins characterized by the presence of one or more lysine-rich motifs. dhns are present in multiple copies in the genome of plant species. although genome-wide analysis of dhns composition and chromosomal distribution has been conducted in herbaceous species, it remains unexplored in woody plants. here, we report on the identification of ten genes encoding eleven putative dhn polypeptides in populus. we document that dhn genes occur as duplicated blocks distributed over seven of the 19 poplar chromosomes likely as a result of segmental and tandem duplication events. based on conserved motifs, poplar dhns were assigned to four subgroups with the kn subgroup being the most frequent. one putative dhn polypeptide (ptrdhn-10) with a sks arrangement could originate from a recombination between skn and kns genes. in silico analysis of microarray data showed that in unstressed poplar, dhn genes are expressed in all vegetative tissues except for mature leaves. this exhaustive survey of dhn genes in poplar provides important information that will assist future studies on their functional role in poplar.  the algorithm described in this paper discovers one or more motifs in a collection of dna or protein sequences by using the technique of expectation maximization to fit a two-component finite mixture model to the set of sequences. multiple motifs are found by fitting a mixture model to the data, probabilistically erasing the occurrences of the motif thus found, and repeating the process to find successive motifs. the algorithm requires only a set of unaligned sequences and a number specifying the width of the motifs as input. it returns a model of each motif and a threshold which together can be used as a bayes-optimal classifier for searching for occurrences of the motif in other databases. the algorithm estimates how many times each motif occurs in each sequence in the dataset and outputs an alignment of the occurrences of the motif. the algorithm is capable of discovering several different motifs with differing numbers of occurrences in a single dataset.
we investigate the benefit of combining both cluster assumption and manifold assumption underlying most of the semi-supervised algorithms using the flexibility and the efficiency of multi-kernel learning. the multiple kernel version of transductive svm (a cluster assumption based approach) is proposed and it is solved based on dc (difference of convex functions) programming. promising results on benchmark data sets suggesting the effectiveness of proposed work.  multiple kernel learning aims at simultaneously learning a kernel and the associated predictor in supervised learning settings. for the support vector machine, an efficient and general multiple kernel learning (mkl) algorithm, based on semi-infinite linear progamming, has been recently proposed. this approach has opened new perspectives since it makes the mkl approach tractable for large-scale problems, by iteratively using existing support vector machine code. however, it turns out that this iterative algorithm needs numerous iterations for converging towards a reasonable solution. in this paper, we address the mkl problem through an adaptive 2-norm regularization formulation that encourages sparse kernel combinations. apart from learning the combination, we solve a standard svm optimization problem, where the kernel is defined as a linear combination of multiple kernels. we propose an algorithm, named simplemkl, for solving this mkl problem and provide a new insight on mkl algorithms based on mixed-norm regularization by showing that the two approaches are equivalent. furthermore, we show how simplemkl can be applied beyond binary classification, for problems like regression, clustering (one-class classification) or multiclass classification. experimental results show that the proposed algorithm converges rapidly and that its efficiency compares favorably to other mkl algorithms. finally, we illustrate the usefulness of mkl for some regressors based on wavelet kernels and on some model selection problems related to multiclass classification problems. a simplemkl toolbox is available at http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/enseignants/~arakotom/code/mklindex.html 1 ha l-0 02 18 33 8, v er si on 1 26 j an 2 00 8
multiple variants of the amber all-atom force field were quantitatively evaluated with respect to their ability to accurately characterize helix-coil equilibria in explicit solvent simulations. using a global distributed computing network, absolute conformational convergence was achieved for large ensembles of the capped a21 and fs helical peptides. further assessment of these amber variants was conducted via simulations of a flexible 164-residue five-helix-bundle protein, apolipophorin-iii, on the 100 ns timescale. of the contemporary potentials that had not been assessed previously, the amber-99sb force field showed significant helix-destabilizing tendencies, with beta bridge formation occurring in helical peptides, and unfolding of apolipophorin-iii occurring on the tens of nanoseconds timescale. the amber-03 force field, while showing adequate helical propensities for both peptides and stabilizing apolipophorin-iii, (i) predicts an unexpected decrease in helicity with ala→arg+ substitution, (ii) lacks experimentally observed 310 helical content, and (iii) deviates strongly from average apolipophorin-iii nmr structural properties. as is observed for amber-99sb, amber-03 significantly overweighs the contribution of extended and polyproline backbone configurations to the conformational equilibrium. in contrast, the amber-99φ force field, which was previously shown to best reproduce experimental measurements of the helix-coil transition in model helical peptides, adequately stabilizes apolipophorin-iii and yields both an average gyration radius and polar solvent exposed surface area that are in excellent agreement with the nmr ensemble.  we study atomic models of the thermodynamics of the structural transition of peptides that form α-helices. the effect of sequence variation on α-helix formation for alanine-rich peptides, ac-ala21- methyl amide (a21) and ac-a5 (aaara)3a-methyl amide (fs peptide), is investigated by atomic simulation studies of the thermodynamics of the helix-coil transition in explicit water. the simulations show that the guanidinium group in the arg side chains in the fs peptide interacts with the carbonyl group four amino acids upstream in the chain and desolvates backbone hydrogen bonds. this desolvation can be directly correlated with a higher probability of hydrogen bond formation. we find that fs has higher helical content than a21 at all temperatures. a small modification in the amber force field reproduces the experimental helical content and helix-coil transition temperatures for the fs peptide.
photoinduced cu(ii)-mediated reversible deactivation radical polymerization (rdrp) was employed to synthesize poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene)-graft-polyacrylonitrile (p(vdf-co-ctfe)-g-pan). the concentration of copper catalyst (cucl2) loading was as low as 1/64 equivalent to chlorine atom in the presence of me6-tren under uv irradiation. the light-responsive nature of graft polymerization was confirmed by “off-on” impulsive irradiation experiments. temporal control of the polymerization process and varied graft contents were achieved via this photoinduced cu(ii)-mediated rdrp.  an environmentally friendly and controllable p(vdf-co-ctfe) hydrogenation route involving the transition-metal complex mediated radical chain transfer reaction is successfully developed to synthesize p(vdf-co-ctfe-co-trfe). the typical transition metal catalysts of atrp reaction could be applied in this process.
real-time three-dimensional (rt3d) echocardiography is a new image acquisition technique that allows instantaneous acquisition of volumetric images for quantitative assessment of cardiac morphology and function. to quantify many important diagnostic parameters, such as ventricular volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output, an automatic algorithm to delineate the left ventricle (lv) from rt3d echocardiographic images is essential. while a number of efforts have been made towards segmentation of the lv endocardial (endo) boundaries, the segmentation of epicardial (epi) boundaries remains problematic. in this paper, we present a coupled deformable model that addresses this problem. the idea behind our method is that the volume of the myocardium is close to being constant during a cardiac cycle and our model uses this coupling as an important constraint. we employ two surfaces, each driven by the image-derived information that takes into account ultrasound physics by modeling the speckle statistics using the nakagami distribution while maintaining the coupling. by simultaneously evolving two surfaces, the final segmentation of the myocardium is thus achieved. results from 80 sets of synthetic data and 286 sets of real canine data were evaluated against the ground truth and against outlines from three independent observers, respectively. we show that results obtained with our incompressibility constraint were more accurate than those obtained without constraint or with a wall thickness constraint, and were comparable to those from manual segmentation.  this study investigated the use of artificial neural networks (ann) for image segmentation and spatial temporal contour linking for the detection of endocardial contours on echocardiographic images. using a backpropagation network, the system was trained with 279 sample regions obtained from eight training images to segment images into either tissue or blood pool region. the ann system was then applied to parasternal short axis images of 38 patients. spatial temporal contour linking was performed on the segmented images to extract endocardial boarders. left ventricular areas (end-systolic and end-diastolic) determined with the automated system were calculated and compared to results obtained by manual contour tracing performed by two independent investigators. in addition, ejection fractions (ef) were derived using the area-length method and compared with radionuclide ventriculography. image quality was classified as good in 12 (32%), moderate in 13 (34%) and poor in 13 (34%) patients. the ann system provided estimates of end-diastolic and end-systolic areas in 36 (89%) of echocardiograms, which correlated well with those obtained by manual tracing (r = 0.99, see = 1.44). a good agreement was also found for the comparison of ef between the ann system and tc-radionuclide ventriculography (rnv, r = 0.93, see = 6.36). the ann system also performed well in the subset of patients with poor image quality. endocardial contour detection using artificial neural networks and spatial temporal contour linking allows accurate calculations of ventricular areas from transthoracic echocardiograms and performs well even in images with poor quality. this system could greatly enhance the feasibility, accuracy and reproducibility of calculating cardiac areas to derive left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions.
cancer is a major disease that affects a significant proportion of the population worldwide. with a decrease in mortality due to advancements in oncology treatment, there is an expanding role for psychosocial oncology. a satellite clinic for medical treatment (only chemotherapy) of cancer is available at the guelph general hospital (ggh). patients accessing the chemotherapy clinic at ggh have minimal access to psychosocial or supportive care and it is not known if the existing services are addressing the psychosocial symptoms of cancer patients. participants were asked to complete an anonymous survey which included self-report measures of depression, symptom severity, quality of life, and social support while receiving treatment at this facility. there was a great deal of variability in the patients’ emotional symptoms at this satellite clinic, though many patients reported emotional difficulties. greater social work presence may lead to better identification of patients who would benefit from psychosocial oncology services.  today only half of those diagnosed with cancer will die of the disease, leaving enormous room for psychosocial interventions to improve the psychological or functional status of those coping with the disease. therefore, social workers in oncology must be current with empirical research. in an effort to integrate current research into social work practice, we reviewed empirical studies with sound research designs to answer the following questions: (1) what portion of cancer patients are likely to need social work services? (2) what types of services do social workers provide to meet these needs? and (3) who is likely to be (or not to be) the recipient of these services. does intervention research include diverse (non-traditional, non-white and non-middle class) clients? the results show about one third of patients will be judged at high-risk for psychosocial problems but that only 15-25% of those who are diagnosed with cancer will eventually use psychosocial oncology services. some have mainly instrumental, concrete needs, and others will use psychosocial counseling. a review of the inclusion of minorities and non-traditional, non-middle-class groups, shows that they are not adequately represented in current intervention research in psychosocial oncology. methods for enlarging their access and participation are suggested.
objective in this article, we aim to (a) identify distinct trajectories of psychological distress in the first year after a breast cancer diagnosis in women treated with adjuvant therapy and (b) explore possible predictors of these trajectories, that is, demographic, medical, and personal characteristics.   method the 171 patients were assessed after diagnosis, after surgery, after adjuvant treatment, in the reentry phase, and in the (short-term) survivorship phase (2 and 6 months after the end of treatment, respectively).   main outcome measure psychological distress was assessed with the 12-item general health questionnaire.   results there were four trajectories of distress: a group that experienced no distress (36.3%), a group that experienced distress only in the active treatment phase (33.3%), a group that experienced distress in the reentry and survivorship phase (15.2%), and a group that experienced chronic distress (15.2%). personality and physical complaints resulting from adjuvant treatment could distinguish the distress trajectories. mastery was the only unique predictor.   conclusion most patients were not distressed in response to breast cancer or only temporarily so. yet, a minority of patients became or remained distressed after the end of treatment.  depression is a significant problem for some breast cancer survivors after the end of treatment. this study assessed depression using the ces‐d for 84 breast cancer patients at the conclusion of radiation treatment, and at 3 and 6 months post‐treatment. based on the pattern of ces‐d scores, patients were divided into five groups: (1) stay depressed (scores above clinical cutoff for depression at all timepoints); (2) recover (above threshold at baseline, but below at follow‐up); (3) become depressed (below threshold at baseline, but above at follow‐up); (4) never depressed (below threshold at all times); and (5) vacillate (none of the above patterns). this study examined the relationships between depression groups and a variety of medical, demographic, and psychological measures, including anxiety and quality of life (qol). number of children at home significantly distinguished the groups, with the become depressed group having more children and the vacillate group having fewer children. anxiety levels were different among the groups, with recover and never depressed groups having consistently lower anxiety scores. qol scores also distinguished the groups in that never depressed patients demonstrated better qol than all other groups. the findings have implications for understanding resilience in cancer patients. copyright © 2005 john wiley & sons, ltd.
backgroundproline racemase (prac) enzymes of trypanosoma cruzi (tcprac), the agent of chagas disease, and trypanosoma vivax (tvprac), the agent of livestock trypanosomosis, have been implicated in the b-cells polyclonal activation contributing to immunosuppression and the evasion of host defences. the similarity to prokaryotic prac and the absence in trypanosoma brucei and trypanosoma congolense have raised many questions about the origin, evolution, and functions of trypanosome prac (tryprac) enzymes.findingswe identified tryprac homologs as single copy genes per haploid genome in 12 of 15 trypanosoma species, including t. cruzi and t. cruzi marinkellei, t. dionisii, t. erneyi, t. rangeli, t. conorhini and t. lewisi, all parasites of mammals. polymorphisms in tcprac genes matched t. cruzi genotypes: tci-tciv and tcbat have unique genes, while the hybrids tcv and tcvi contain tcpraca and tcpracb from parental tcii and tciii, respectively. prac homologs were identified in trypanosomes from anurans, snakes, crocodiles, lizards, and birds. most trypanosomes have intact prac genes. t. rangeli possesses only pseudogenes, maybe in the process of being lost. t. brucei, t. congolense and their allied species, except the more distantly related t. vivax, have completely lost prac genes.conclusionsthe genealogy of tryprac homologs supports an evolutionary history congruent with the trypanosoma phylogeny. this finding, together with the synteny of prac loci, the relationships with prokaryotic prac inferred by taxon-rich phylogenetic analysis, and the absence in trypanosomatids of any other genera or in bodonids or euglenids suggest that a common ancestor of trypanosoma gained prac gene by a single and ancient horizontal gene transfer (hgt) from a firmicutes bacterium more closely related to gemella and other species of bacilli than to clostridium as previously suggested. our broad phylogenetic study allowed investigation of tryprac evolution over long and short timescales. tryprac genes diverged to become species-specific and genotype-specific for t. cruzi and t. rangeli, with resulting genealogies congruent with those obtained using vertically inherited genes. the inventory of tryprac genes described here is the first step toward the understanding of the roles of prac enzymes in trypanosomes differing in life cycles, virulence, and infection and immune evasion strategies.  lymphocyte polyclonal activation is a generalized mechanism of immune evasion among pathogens. in a mouse model of trypanosoma cruzi infection (american trypanosomiasis), reduced levels of polyclonal lymphocyte responses correlate with resistance to infection and cardiopathy. we report here the characterization of a parasite protein with b-cell mitogenic properties in culture supernatants of infective forms, the cloning of the corresponding gene and the analysis of the biological properties of its product. we characterized the protein as a co-factor-independent proline racemase, and show that its expression as a cytoplasmic and/or membrane-associated protein is life-stage specific. inhibition studies indicate that availability of the racemase active site is necessary for mitogenic activity. this is the first report to our knowledge of a eukaryotic amino acid racemase gene. our findings have potential consequences for the development of new immune therapies and drug design against pathogens.
we present a novel adaptive clustering model for coreference resolution in which the expert rules of a state of the art deterministic system are used as features over pairs of clusters. a significant advantage of the new approach is that the expert rules can be easily augmented with new semantic features. we demonstrate this advantage by incorporating semantic compatibility features for neutral pronouns computed from web n-gram statistics. experimental results show that the combination of the new features with the expert rules in the adaptive clustering approach results in an overall performance improvement, and over 5% improvement in f1 measure for the target pronouns when evaluated on the ace 2004 newswire corpus.  most coreference resolution models determine if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over a set of constraints or features. this approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. to overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. each tier builds on the previous tier's entity cluster output. further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. this cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. the framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. in spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. this suggests that sieve-based approaches could be applied to other nlp tasks.
backgroundgentiana rigescens, an important medicinal plant in china, has been widely cultivated in yunnan province, china. previous studies were focused on analysis and determination of the metabolites isolated from this species, the accumulation of these metabolites during growth period are not yet clear. in this study, samples for the experiments were obtained by tissue culture. ft-ir and lc-ms/ms method were performed to distinguish the variation on the major metabolites in g. rigescens during growing stage when combined with chemometrics.resultsmethodology validations were all within the required limits. the metabolites were visually different in tissue culture samples and mature plants. the diversity of metabolites increased proportionally with plant growth. the quantitative analysis showed the content of gentiopicroside was significantly vary during different growing stage. the highest content of gentiopicroside (122.93 ± 7.01 mg/g) was detected in leaf of regenerated plantlet, whereas its content in root significantly increased along with underground parts growth. moreover, flavonoids mainly distributed in aerial parts showed potential competitive relationship during plant growth.conclusionthe distribution and accumulation of metabolites are associated with different parts and plant growth, which provide potential evidences for the rational application and exploitation of g. rigescens.  a method based on hplc with diode array detector (dad) and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (esi-ms) was established for the simultaneous determination of 5-hmf and its derivatives, including a new 5-hmf derivative, in rehmanniae radix preparata. validation parameters, such as linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, recovery, accuracy, and precision, were successfully obtained. in addition, the efficiencies of diverse extraction methods were compared for the development of a standard analytical method. the verified method was successfully applied to the quantitative determination of four representative metabolites in eighteen r. radix preparata samples from korea and china. additionally, the increase in the amount of 5-hmf derivatives was monitored during the processing of three dried r. radix samples. the results showed that a newly isolated diglycosylated 5-hmf derivative, 5-(α-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→6)-α-d-galactopyranosyloxymethyl)-2-furancarboxaldehyde, appeared in concentrations comparable to that of 5-hmf, suggesting its potential to serve as a marker compound in r. radix preparata.
increased kraft pulp mill production generates increased solid wastes. in response, composting has emerged as an interesting alternative for disposal of these solid wastes. a central composite factor design was used to investigate the influence of incubation conditions (dregs addition and operation time) on chemical and biological parameters, determining the best in-vessel conditions in order to develop a correct composting design. dregs helped reduce the ph drop that occurs at the beginning of the process. biological activities presented high values during the active phase, followed by a decrease with stable final values along with n-nh(4)(+) and n-no(3)(-) trend, which were indicative of mature compost. dregs addition had not significant effect on the biological activities during composting of kraft mill sludge. however, moderate amounts of dregs (between 5% and 8%) at operation time of 60-70 days would be the best compromise.  two-phase olive mill waste (tpomw) is a semisolid sludge generated during the extraction of olive oil by the two-phase centrifugation system. among all the available disposal options, composting is gaining interest as a sustainable strategy to recycle tpomw for agricultural purposes. the quality of compost for agronomical use depends on the degree of organic matter stabilization, but despite several studies on the topic, there is not a single method available which alone can give a certain indication of compost stability. in addition, information on the biological and biochemical properties, including the enzymatic activity (ea) of compost, is rare. the aim of this work was to investigate the suitability of some enzymatic activities (beta-glucosidase, arylsulphatase, acid-phosphatase, alkaline-phosphatase, urease and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (fda)) as parameters to evaluate organic matter stability during the composting of tpomw. these enzymatic indices were also compared to conventional stability indices. for this purpose two composting piles were prepared by mixing tpomw with sheep manure and grape stalks in different proportions, with forced aeration and occasional turnings. the composting of tpomw followed the common pattern reported previously for this kind of material with a reduction of 40-50% of organic matter, a gradual increase in ph, disappearance of phytotoxicity and formation of humic-like c. all ea increased during composting except acid-phosphatase. significant correlations were found between ea and some important conventional stability indices indicating that ea can be a simple and reliable tool to determine the degree of stability of tpomw composts.
abstract origin and tectonic setting of the late neoproterozoic dokhan volcanics (ca. 610–560 ma by whole rock rb–sr and ca. 600–590 ma by shrimp u–pb zircon) in the egyptian eastern desert is debated. debate concerns the tectonic setting they formed in, during transition between convergent to extensional, during or after collision of e and w gondwana ∼600 ma. in order to solve this problem, we studied the geology and analyzed major and trace elements of lavas from wadi um sidra and um asmer in the northern eastern desert. these range from medium- to high-k basalt to rhyolite. they comprise voluminous medium- to high-k calc-alkaline lavas, subordinate adakitic lavas, and minor alkali basalt. adakitic lavas contain very low y ( 767 ppm) and sr/y (>40). they also have high cr and ni and low nb, rb, and zr contents compared to coexisting calc-alkaline lavas. the adakitic lavas exhibit a fractionated rare earth element (ree) patterns with hree depletion (la n /lu n  = 11.1–14.4), while calc-alkaline rocks have less fractionated ree patterns (la n /lu n  = 6.3–9.4). ree patterns of the alkali basalt are also similar to that of adakitic lavas. these alkali basalt, calc-alkaline, and adakitic lavas all show enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (liles) and show negative nb–ta anomalies with high th/zr, which suggest involvement of subducted slab melts in their petrogenesis. our proposal is subduction of hot oceanic ridge before collision and later melting of the hot oceanic slab beneath dokhan even after collision event.  willis, k.m., stern, r.j. and clauer, n., 1988. age and geochemistry of late precambrian sediments of the hammamat series from the northeastern desert of egypt. precambrian res., 42: 173-187. late precambrian crustal evolution in the northeastern desert of egypt culminated in a major episode of strong extension, accompanied by bimodal igneous activity and deposition of clastic sediments in restricted terrigenous basins. these sediments, known as the hammamat series, record the uncovering of the evolving crust of the region. we have undertaken petrographic, geochemical, and rb-sr and k-ar geochronologic studies of hammamat samples collected along a single traverse. the lower half of a 400 m thick section consists of coarse detritus shed from nearby ensimatic terranes, while the upper half was derived from rapid reworking of bimodal igneous rocks similar to those of the dokhan volcanics and pink granites, units that are preserved within the region. rb-sr whole-rock analyses give an 8-point isochron age of 585 +_ 15 ma with an initial stsr/~sr of 0.70323 ± 0.00013, interpreted to approximate closely the time of sedimentation. this is very similar to the k-ar ages of the coarser clay fractions (2-0.5 #m) (588-567 ma). this result is consistent with stratigraphic considerations and other geochronological studies indicating that hammamat deposition occurred at ~ 590 ma. rb-sr analyses of leached and unleached size fractions indicate thermal resetting at 524 +_ 17 ma accompanied or followed by fluxing of a radiogenic sr-rich pore fluid (stsr/s~sr =0.7124). this is further indicated by k-ar ages of the 0.2-0.5 ttm size fraction of 542-532 ma.
background pancreatic cancer, primarily pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pdac), accounts for 2.4% of cancer diagnoses and 5.8% of cancer death annually. early diagnoses can improve 5-year survival in pdac. the aim of this systematic review was to determine the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy values for mri, ct, pet&pet/ct, eus and transabdominal ultrasound (taus) in the diagnosis of pdac.   methods a systematic review was undertaken to identify studies reporting sensitivity, specificity and/or diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of pdac with mri, ct, pet, eus or taus. proportional meta-analysis was performed for each modality.   results a total of 5399 patients, 3567 with pdac, from 52 studies were included. the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy were 93% (95% ci=88-96), 89% (95% ci=82-94) and 90% (95% ci=86-94) for mri; 90% (95% ci=87-93), 87% (95% ci=79-93) and 89% (95% ci=85-93) for ct; 89% (95% ci=85-93), 70% (95% ci=54-84) and 84% (95% ci=79-89) for pet; 91% (95% ci=87-94), 86% (95% ci=81-91) and 89% (95% ci=87-92) for eus; and 88% (95% ci=86-90), 94% (95% ci=87-98) and 91% (95% c=87-93) for taus.   conclusion this review concludes all modalities, except for pet, are equivalent within 95% confidence intervals for the diagnosis of pdac.  abstract objective. to evaluate contrast-enhanced ultrasound (ceus) and compare it to ultrasound (us) and 64-slice-ct (64-ct) for diagnosing, staging and evaluation of resectability of pancreatic cancer. material and methods. us, ceus and 64-ct were performed in 49 consecutive patients with pancreatic head tumors and with suspected cancer. after evaluation 44 patients had pancreatic head adenocarcinoma and 5 had chronic pancreatitis, all confirmed by histology. results. the sensitivity of us, ceus and 64-ct for diagnosing malignant pancreatic head tumors was 89%, 86% and 93%, respectively, and the overall accuracy was 82%, 86% and 88% respectively. there was no significant difference in the malignant tumor size measurement between us and ceus (p = 0.3619) or between us and 64-ct (p = 0.2129), but a significant difference was seen in the size measured by ceus and 64-ct (p = 0.0197). the ceus measurements on the tumor size were smaller. the overall accuracy for m staging of the patients who had surgery for adenocarcinoma was 86% and 90% for us + ceus and 64-ct, respectively. by performing the ceus and 64-ct we additionally found, respectively, 35% and 45% non-resectable patients of a group of patients, who were considered resectable on the primary radiological image material. conclusions. ceus may be a useful diagnostic tool in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic head tumors. for the assessment of resectability ceus did not prove useful. however, ceus seemed very useful as an additional instrument in the detection of non-resectable patients already considered resectable on primary radiological image material.
convolutional sparse coding (csc) has been popularly used for the learning of shift-invariant dictionaries in image and signal processing. however, existing methods have limited scalability. in this paper, instead of convolving with a dictionary shared by all samples, we propose the use of a sample-dependent dictionary in which filters are obtained as linear combinations of a small set of base filters learned from the data. this added flexibility allows a large number of sample-dependent patterns to be captured, while the resultant model can still be efficiently learned by online learning. extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing csc algorithms with significantly reduced time and space requirements.  in recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of signals. using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. recent activity in this field concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. designing dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a pre-specified set of linear transforms, or by adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. both these techniques have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. in this paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations. given a set of training signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints. we present a new method – the k-svd algorithm – generalizing the k-means clustering process. k-svd is an iterative method that alternates between sparse coding of the examples based on the current dictionary, and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better fit the data. the update of the dictionary columns is combined with an update of the sparse representations, thereby accelerating convergence. the k-svd algorithm is flexible and can work with any pursuit method (e.g., basis pursuit, focuss, or matching pursuit). we analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its results on both synthetic tests and in applications on real image data.
abstract alpha interferon (ifn-α) is an approved medication for chronic hepatitis b. gamma interferon (ifn-γ) is a key mediator of host antiviral immunity against hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection in vivo. however, the molecular mechanism by which these antiviral cytokines suppress hbv replication remains elusive. using an immortalized murine hepatocyte (aml12)-derived cell line supporting tetracycline-inducible hbv replication, we show in this report that both ifn-α and ifn-γ efficiently reduce the amount of intracellular hbv nucleocapsids. furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that the ifn-induced cellular antiviral response is able to distinguish and selectively accelerate the decay of hbv replication-competent nucleocapsids but not empty capsids in a proteasome-dependent manner. our findings thus reveal a novel antiviral mechanism of ifns and provide a basis for a better understanding of hbv pathobiology.  hepatocytes are extensively used in studies of gene regulation but cannot be maintained in long-term culture as replicating, differentiated cells while remaining nontumorigenic. we have derived two hepatocyte lines from livers of transgenic mice overexpressing transforming growth factor alpha, a potent hepatocyte mitogen, which overcome these limitations. the transgenic hepatocytes were maintained for > or = 2 months in serum-supplemented primary culture and gave rise to cell lines, of which two (aml12 and aml14) have been cultured for > 1.5 years (> 80 passages). both lines have typical hepatocyte features such as peroxisomes and bile canalicular-like structures, do not grow in soft agar, and are nontumorigenic in nude mice. like normal hepatocytes, aml cells express high levels of mrna for serum (albumin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and transferrin) and gap junction (connexins 26 and 32) proteins, secrete albumin, and contain solely isozyme 5 of lactate dehydrogenase. after extensive passaging, aml12 cells continue to strongly coexpress hepatocyte connexin mrnas but do not display nonparenchymal cell markers. although mrna levels for some serum proteins progressively fall, high expression in late aml12 cultures may be regained by passage in serum-free medium. the aml14 line loses expression of both differentiated markers and transgene mrna with extended passaging, and hepatocytic traits are only partially restored by passage in serum-free medium. these differentiated, nontumorigenic cell lines should serve as models in which to study hepatocyte growth and differentiation.
glioblastoma (gbm) is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor and still lacks effective therapeutic strategies. it has already been shown that old drugs like sulfasalazine (sas) and valproic acid (vpa) present antitumoral activities in glioma cell lines. sas has also been associated with a decrease of intracellular glutathione (gsh) levels through a potent inhibition of xc- glutamate/cystine exchanger leading to an antioxidant deprotection. in the same way, vpa was recently identified as a histone deacetylase (hdat) inhibitor capable of activating tumor suppression genes. as both drugs are widely used in clinical practice and their profile of adverse effects is well known, the aim of our study was to investigate the effects of the combined treatment with sas and vpa in gbm cell lines. we observed that both drugs were able to reduce cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and the combined treatment potentiated these effects. combined treatment also increased cell death and inhibited proliferation of gbm cells, while having no effect on human and rat cultured astrocytes. also, we observed high protein expression of the catalytic subunit of xc- in all the examined gbm cell lines, and treatment with sas blocked its activity and decreased intracellular gsh levels. noteworthy, sas but not vpa was also able to reduce the [14c]-ascorbate uptake. together, these data indicate that sas and vpa exhibit a substantial effect on gbm cell’s death related to an intracellular oxidative response imbalance, making this combination of drugs a promising therapeutic strategy.  temozolomide (tmz) is an oral alkylating agent that has been widely used in the treatment of refractory glioma, although inherent and acquired resistance to this drug is common. the clinical use of valproic acid (vpa) as an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug has been reported primarily for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder and less commonly for major depression. vpa is also used in the treatment of glioma-associated seizures with or without intracranial operation. in this study, we evaluated the potential synergistic effect of tmz and vpa in human glioma cell lines. compared with the use of tmz or vpa alone, concurrent treatment with both drugs synergistically induced apoptosis in u87mg cells as evidenced by p53 and bax expression, mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss, reactive oxygen species production, and glutathione depletion. this synergistic effect correlated with a decrease in nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor and corresponded with reduced heme oxygenase-1 and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase expression. pretreatment with n-acetylcysteine partially recovered the apoptotic effect of the tmz/vpa combination treatment. the same degree of synergism is also seen in p53-mutant hs683 cells, which indicates that p53 may not play a major role in the increased proapoptotic effect of the tmz/vpa combination. in conclusion, vpa enhanced the apoptotic effect of tmz, possibly through a redox regulation mechanism. the tmz/vpa combination may be effective for treating glioma cancer and may be a powerful agent against malignant glioma. this drug combination should be further explored in the clinical setting.
the suppressor of cytokine signaling (socs) proteins are critical, highly conserved feedback inhibitors of signal transduction cascades. the family of socs proteins is divided into two groups: ancestral and vertebrate-specific socs proteins. vertebrate-specific socs proteins have been heavily studied as a result of their strong mutant phenotypes. however, the ancestral clade remains less studied, a potential result of genetic redundancies in mammals. use of the genetically tractable organism drosophila melanogaster enables in vivo assessment of signaling components and mechanisms with less concern about the functional redundancy observed in mammals. in this study, we investigated how the socs family member suppressor of cytokine signaling at 36e (socs36e) attenuates janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (jak/stat) activation during specification of motile border cells in drosophila oogenesis. we found that socs36e genetically interacts with the cullin2 (cul2) scaffolding protein. like socs36e, cul2 is required to limit the number of motile cells in egg chambers. we demonstrated that loss of cul2 in the follicle cells significantly increased nuclear stat protein levels, which resulted in additional cells acquiring invasive properties. further, reduction of cul2 suppressed border cell migration defects that occur in a stat92e-sensitized genetic background. our data incorporated cul2 into a previously described jak/stat-directed genetic regulatory network that is required to generate a discrete boundary between cell fates. we also found that socs36e is able to attenuate stat activity in the egg chamber when it does not have a functional socs box. collectively, this work contributes mechanistic insight to a jak/stat regulatory genetic circuit, and suggests that socs36e regulates jak/stat signaling via a cul2-dependent mechanism, as well as by a cullin-independent manner, in vivo.  patterns of cell fates generated by morphogens are critically important for normal development; however, the mechanisms by which graded morphogen signals are converted into all-or-none cell fate responses are incompletely understood. in the drosophila ovary, high and sustained levels of the secreted morphogen unpaired (upd) specify the migratory border-cell population by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat). a lower or transient level of stat activity specifies a non-migratory population of follicle cells. here we identify mir-279 as a component of a feedback pathway that further dampens the response in cells with low levels of jak/stat activity. mir-279 directly repressed stat, and loss of mir-279 mimicked stat gain-of-function or loss of apontic (apt), a known feedback inhibitor of stat. apt was essential for mir-279 expression in non-migratory follicle cells, whereas another stat target, ken and barbie (ken), downregulated mir-279 in border cells. mathematical modelling and simulations of this regulatory circuit including mir-279, apt and ken supported key roles for mir-279 and apt in generating threshold responses to the upd gradient.
immunosuppressive therapy is a therapeutic option for selected low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) patients. besides standard treatment protocols that include atg and csa, the humanized cd52 antibody alemtuzumab has been shown to have efficacy in mds treatment. we report our experience with alemtuzumab in nine mds rcmd patients. all patients had a hypocellular bone marrow with a blast count <5 % and were classified as intermediate-1 according to the ipss. we found a response in five patients (60 %); three patients achieved a complete remission 3 and 6 months after the treatment with alemtuzumab, and two patients showed a haematological improvement. alemtuzumab was administered in a 10-mg dosage for 10 days. treatment was well tolerated, and no severe side effects were observed. we could confirm the finding that the alemtuzumab is effective and save selected mds patients. due to the promising results, further studies, especially with regard to long-term survival and risk of leucemic progression should be initiated.  immunosuppressive therapy has been shown to induce sustained hematological responses in a subset of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (mds). in particular, antithymocyte globulin (atg), a polyclonal immunoglobulin induces hematological responses in up to 60% of mds patients. we report herein on the results of a retrospective multicenter study on the use of atg in the treatment of 96 patients with mds. patients were evaluated for duration of response to atg, as well as survival after administration of atg. the median age of the cohort was 54.7 years (range: 19–75 years), with a median follow-up of 33.8 months (range: 0.8–133 months). a total of 40 patients (42%) achieved a hematological response, of which 30 patients (75%) had a durable hematological response lasting a median duration of 31.5 months (range: 6–92 months). on multivariate analysis, both low international prognostic scoring system (ipss) and bone marrow (bm) hypocellularity were independent predictive factors for improved response to atg (ipss int-2/high: odds ratio (or) 0.08, p=0.018 and bm normo/hypercellularity: or 0.49, p=0.012). in addition, ipss was the sole predictor of overall survival, with int-2/high risk patients having a significantly poorer survival outcome (or 0.08, p<0.01). in conclusion, this study identifies bm hypocellularity and a low ipss as important factors predicting response to atg.
backgrounddegenerative adult de novo (dad) scoliosis appears characteristically in the sixth or seventh decade with symptoms of severe back pain and radiculopathy or spinal claudication. the aim of this study was to enhance the knowledge of perioperative complications and detect possible risk factors in this selective dad scoliosis surgery.methodsthis retrospective study included only patients with dad scoliosis undergone correction spondylodesis with previous failure of conservative treatment. excluded were patients with other types of scoliosis and previous fusion surgeries. patient epidemiological data, medical comorbidities and treatments were included. intraoperative data and perioperative complications were documented. analyses regarding early, late and no complications were undertaken.resultsa total of 92 patients with a mean age of 67.29 ± 7.93 years and clinical follow-up visits of minimum 12 months were included. on average, 5.26 ± 2.24 segments were fused. early complications (e.g. wound healing defects, paresis, screw loosing) occurred in 23 patients and often required a re-operation. cardiac arrhythmias, pacemaker and coumarin derivative therapies were associated with increased perioperative complications. the transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion technique was associated with early complications. adjacent segment failure occurred in 36% and was the major late complication. twenty patients did not have any complications in the minimum follow-up.conclusionsthis study analysed a selective dad scoliosis collective and its’ surgical treatment outcomes. it identified numerous perioperative complications (adjacent segment failure, postoperative paresis and epidural hematoma) and multiple possible predisposing risk factors (e.g. operative techniques and anti-coagulation therapies). this here gained information raises awareness in preoperative patient selection and preparation. further studies in dad scoliosis and a risk-adjusted patient selection/preparation are needed to improve treatment quality and outcomes.  the purpose of this study was to document the diagnostic findings in a group of adult patients presenting with both scoliosis and pain. fifty-five adults were evaluated by medical history, physical examination, radiography, myelography followed by computed tomography, discography followed by computed tomography, and single- and dual-photon densitometry. curves were 49% adult degenerative onset, 44% idiopathic. the older degenerative patients had myelographic defects most commonly within the primary curve and multiple abnormal, not necessarily painful, discs throughout the lumbar spine on discography. the idiopathic group had myelographic defects most commonly in a compensatory lumbar or lumbosacral curve. on discography, all idiopathic patients had at least one abnormal, painful disc, and 88% had their pain reproduced. pain-producing pathology was frequently identified in areas that would not have been included in the fusion area according to accepted rules for treatment of idiopathic scoliosis.
background adolescent risk-taking, including behaviors resulting in injury or death, has been attributed in part to maturational differences in mesolimbic incentive-motivational neurocircuitry, including ostensible oversensitivity of the nucleus accumbens (nacc) to rewards. methodology/principal findings to test whether adolescents showed increased nacc activation by cues for rewards, or by delivery of rewards, we scanned 24 adolescents (age 12–17) and 24 adults age (22–42) with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a monetary incentive delay (mid) task. the mid task was configured to temporally disentangle potential reward or potential loss anticipation-related brain signal from reward or loss notification-related signal. subjects saw cues signaling opportunities to win or avoid losing $0, $.50, or $5 for responding quickly to a subsequent target. subjects then viewed feedback of their trial success after a variable interval from cue presentation of between 6 to17 s. adolescents showed reduced nacc recruitment by reward-predictive cues compared to adult controls in a linear contrast with non-incentive cues, and in a volume-of-interest analysis of signal change in the nacc. in contrast, adolescents showed little difference in striatal and frontocortical responsiveness to reward deliveries compared to adults. conclusions/significance in light of divergent developmental difference findings between neuroimaging incentive paradigms (as well as at different stages within the same task), these data suggest that maturational differences in incentive-motivational neurocircuitry: 1) may be sensitive to nuances of incentive tasks or stimuli, such as behavioral or learning contingencies, and 2) may be specific to the component of the instrumental behavior (such as anticipation versus notification).  adolescence is a developmental period that entails substantial changes in affective and incentive-seeking behavior relative to both childhood and adulthood, including a heightened propensity to engage in risky behaviors and experience persistent negative and labile mood states. this review discusses the emotional and incentive-driven behavioral changes in adolescents and their associated neural mechanisms, focusing on the dynamic interactions between the amygdala, ventral striatum, and prefrontal cortex. common behavioral changes during adolescence may be associated with a heightened responsiveness to incentives and emotional cues while the capacity to effectively engage in cognitive and emotion regulation is still relatively immature. we highlight empirical work in humans and animals that addresses the interactions between these neural systems in adolescents relative to children and adults, and propose a neurobiological model that may account for the nonlinear changes in adolescent behavior. finally, we discuss other influences that may contribute to exaggerated reward and emotion processing associated with adolescence, including hormonal fluctuations and the role of the social environment.
the number of copies of rrna (rrn) operons in a bacterial genome differs greatly among bacterial species. here we examined the phenotypic effects of variations in the number of copies of rrna genes in the genome of bacillus subtilis by analysis of eight mutant strains constructed to carry from two to nine copies of the rrn operon. we found that a decrease in the number of copies from ten to one increased the doubling time, and decreased the sporulation frequency and motility. the maximum levels for transformation activity were similar among the strains, although the competence development was significantly delayed in the strain with a single rrn operon. normal sporulation only occurred if more than four copies of the rrn operon were present, although ten copies were needed for vegetative growth after germination of the spores. this behaviour was seen even though the intracellular level of ribosomes was similar among strains with four to ten copies of the rrn operon. furthermore, ten copies of the rrn operon were needed for the highest swarming activity. we also constructed 21 strains that carried all possible combinations of two copies of the rrn operons, and found that these showed a range of growth rates and sporulation frequencies that all fell between those recorded for strains with one or three copies of the rrn operon. the results suggested that the copy number of the rrn operon has a major influence on cellular processes such as growth rate and sporulation frequency.  rna was extracted from dormant and germinating bacillus subtilis 168 spores (intact spores and chemically decoated spores) by using rapid rupture followed by acid–phenol extraction. spore germination progress was monitored by assaying colony forming ability before and after heat shock and by reading the optical density at 600 nm. the purity, yield, and composition of the extracted rna were determined spectrophotometrically from the ratio of absorption at 260 nm to that at 280 nm; in a 2100 bioanalyzer, giving the rna yield/108 spores or cells and the distribution pattern of rrna components. the method reported here for the extraction of rna from dormant spores, as well as during different phases of germination and outgrowth, has proven to be fast, efficient and simple to handle. rna of a high purity was obtained from dormant spores and during all phases of germination and growth. there was a significant increase in rna yield during the transition from dormant spores to germination and subsequent outgrowth. chemically decoated spores were retarded in germination and outgrowth compared with intact spores, and less rna was extracted; however, the differences were not significant. this method for rna isolation of dormant, germinating, and outgrowing bacterial endospores is a valuable prerequisite for gene expression studies, especially in studies on the responses of spores to hostile environmental conditions.
we present a novel adaptive clustering model for coreference resolution in which the expert rules of a state of the art deterministic system are used as features over pairs of clusters. a significant advantage of the new approach is that the expert rules can be easily augmented with new semantic features. we demonstrate this advantage by incorporating semantic compatibility features for neutral pronouns computed from web n-gram statistics. experimental results show that the combination of the new features with the expert rules in the adaptive clustering approach results in an overall performance improvement, and over 5% improvement in f1 measure for the target pronouns when evaluated on the ace 2004 newswire corpus.  most coreference resolution models determine if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over a set of constraints or features. this approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. to overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. each tier builds on the previous tier's entity cluster output. further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. this cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. the framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. in spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. this suggests that sieve-based approaches could be applied to other nlp tasks.
image instance retrieval is the problem of retrieving images from a database which contain the same object. convolutional neural network (cnn) based descriptors are becoming the dominant approach for generating global image descriptors for the instance retrieval problem. one major drawback of cnn-based global descriptors is that uncompressed deep neural network models require hundreds of megabytes of storage making them inconvenient to deploy in mobile applications or in custom hardware. in this work, we study the problem of neural network model compression focusing on the image instance retrieval task. we study quantization, coding, pruning and weight sharing techniques for reducing model size for the instance retrieval problem. we provide extensive experimental results on the trade-off between retrieval performance and model size for different types of networks on several data sets providing the most comprehensive study on this topic. we compress models to the order of a few mbs: two orders of magnitude smaller than the uncompressed models while achieving negligible loss in retrieval performance1.  evidence is mounting that convnets are the best representation learning method for recognition. in the common scenario, a convnet is trained on a large labeled dataset and the feed-forward units activation, at a certain layer of the network, is used as a generic representation of an input image. recent studies have shown this form of representation to be astoundingly effective for a wide range of recognition tasks. this paper thoroughly investigates the transferability of such representations w.r.t. several factors. it includes parameters for training the network such as its architecture and parameters of feature extraction. we further show that different visual recognition tasks can be categorically ordered based on their distance from the source task. we then show interesting results indicating a clear correlation between the performance of tasks and their distance from the source task conditioned on proposed factors. furthermore, by optimizing these factors, we achieve state-of-the-art performances on 16 visual recognition tasks.
background: perioperative straight sinus thrombosis is extremely rare. case description: a 59-year-old female was admitted to our department because of incidentally found small anterior cerebral artery (a1) aneurysm with microbleeding. after clipping the cerebral aneurysm, she had delayed emergence from anesthesia, total aphasia, and right hemiparesis. fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (flair) magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of the head showed hyperintensity in the bilateral caudate nuclei, putamina, and thalami, and computed tomography of the head showed a hyperdense straight sinus, suggesting straight sinus thrombosis. her neurologic symptoms improved gradually, and she achieved a full clinical recovery, with radiological evidence of recanalization of the straight sinus at follow-up. conclusion: the possibility of straight sinus thrombosis should be considered in postoperative patients with unexplained postoperative deficits when mri demonstrates hyperintensity in the bilateral basal ganglia and thalami on flair signal images.  the basal ganglia and thalamus are paired deep gray matter structures that may be involved by a wide variety of disease entities. the basal ganglia are highly metabolically active and are symmetrically affected in toxic poisoning, metabolic abnormalities, and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. both the basal ganglia and thalamus may be affected by other systemic or metabolic disease, degenerative disease, and vascular conditions. focal flavivirus infections, toxoplasmosis, and primary central nervous system lymphoma may also involve both deep gray matter structures. the thalamus is more typically affected alone by focal conditions than by systemic disease. radiologists may detect bilateral abnormalities of the basal ganglia and thalamus in different acute and chronic clinical situations, and although magnetic resonance (mr) imaging is the modality of choice for evaluation, the correct diagnosis can be made only by taking all relevant clinical and laboratory information into account. the neuroimaging diagnosis is influenced not only by detection of specific mr imaging features such as restricted diffusion and the presence of hemorrhage, but also by detection of abnormalities involving other parts of the brain, especially the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and white matter. judicious use of confirmatory neuroimaging investigations, especially diffusion-weighted imaging, mr angiography, mr venography, and mr spectroscopy during the same examination, may help improve characterization of these abnormalities and help narrow the differential diagnosis.
we propose a data structure obtained by hierarchically pooling bag-of-words (bow) descriptors during a sequence of views that achieves average speedups in large-scale loop closure applications ranging from 2 to 20 times on benchmark datasets. although simple, the method works as well as sophisticated agglomerative schemes at a fraction of the cost with minimal loss of performance.  this paper presents a mathematical definition of the "probability-weighted amount of information" (pwi), a measure of specificity of terms in documents that is based on an information-theoretic view of retrieval events. the proposed pwi is expressed as a product of the occurrence probabilities of terms and their amounts of information, and corresponds well with the conventional term frequency-inverse document frequency measures that are commonly used in today's information retrieval systems. the mathematical definition of the pwi is shown, together with some illustrative examples of the calculation.
the order-preserving submatrices (opsms) are employed to discover significant biological associations between genes and experiment conditions. herein, we propose a new relaxed opsm model by considering the linearity relaxation, which is called the bucket opsm (bopsm) model. an efficient method called apribopsm is developed to exhaustively mine such bopsm patterns. we further generalize the bopsm model by incorporating the similarity relaxation strategy. we develop a generalized bopsm model called gebopsm and adopt a pattern growing method called seedgrowth to mine gebopsm patterns. informally, the seedgrowth algorithm adopts two different growing strategies on rows and columns in order to expand a seed bopsm into a maximal gebopsm pattern. we conduct a series of experiments using both synthetic and biological datasets to study the effectiveness of our proposed relaxed models and the efficiency of the relevant mining methods. the bopsm model is shown to be able to capture the characteristics of noisy opsm patterns, and is superior to the strict counterparts. apribopsm is also significantly more efficient than opc-tree, which is the state-of-the-art opsm mining method. compared to all the current relaxed opsm models, the gebopsm model achieves the best performance in terms of the number of mined quality patterns.  subspace clustering has attracted great attention due to its capability of finding salient patterns in high dimensional data. order preserving subspace clusters have been proven to be important in high throughput gene expression analysis, since functionally related genes are often co-expressed under a set of experimental conditions. such co-expression patterns can be represented by consistent orderings of attributes. existing order preserving cluster models require all objects in a cluster have identical attribute order without deviation. however, real data are noisy due to measurement technology limitation and experimental variability which prohibits these strict models from revealing true clusters corrupted by noise. in this paper, we study the problem of revealing the order preserving clusters in the presence of noise. we propose a noise-tolerant model called approximate order preserving cluster (aopc). instead of requiring all objects in a cluster have identical attribute order, we require that (1) at least a certain fraction of the objects have identical attribute order; (2) other objects in the cluster may deviate from the consensus order by up to a certain fraction of attributes. we also propose an algorithm to mine aopc. experiments on gene expression data demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm.
objectives: the rate and impact of thyroglossal duct remnant (tgdr) visualization in patients with hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma (dtc) have not yet been fully determined. the aim of this study was to assess the rate of tgdr visualization in post total thyroidectomy whole body scan (wbs) for dtc and to evaluate its impact on the outcome of i-131 ablation. methods: a total of 60 consecutive dtc patients (51 papillary thyroid ca., and 9 follicular thyroid ca.), underwent total thyroidectomy, followed by wbs (using i-131 in 28 patients and i-123 in 32 patients), neck ultrasound (us), thyroglobulin (tg) and tg anti-bodies (tgab) assay after 40 days and subsequent i-131 ablation. at 6 months later follow-up i-131 wbs, neck u/s, tg and tgab were performed following suspension of l-thyroxine for 1-month (thyroid stimulating hormone [tsh] >30 μiu/ml) in 53 patients and following recombinant human tsh stimulation in seven patients. results: of the studied 60 patients, 19/60 (31.7%) had a linear or focal radioactivity at the superior midline of the neck, suggesting tgdr (group 1), and 41/60 (68.3%) had no uptake to suggest tgdr (group 2). no significant difference regarding age, gender and histopathology between both groups. neck us showed no evidence of thyroid tissue in the superior midline of the neck in both groups, and only a small or no residual thyroid tissue in patients of group 1. there was a significant successful i-131 ablation rate among patients of group 1 compared to group 2 (79% in group 1 vs. 41.5% in group 2) (p = 0.007). conclusions: thyroglossal duct remnant visualization on wbs of hypothyroid subjects after total thyroidectomy suggests presence of only a small or no residual functioning thyroid tissue at the thyroid bed and can predict a good response to i-131 ablation.  objective the purpose of this study was to determine the incremental value of (131)i spect/ct over traditional planar imaging of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma.   materials and methods fifty-six planar and spect/ct scans were obtained for 53 patients. forty-eight scans were diagnostic (131)i studies before first radioiodine therapy, four were diagnostic (131)i studies with recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone stimulation, and four scans were posttherapy (131)i studies. two nuclear physicians interpreted central neck and distant activity on planar scans and reviewed spect/ct images to assess the incremental diagnostic value with respect to localization and characterization of focal activity and to evaluate reader confidence. one of the readers was unblinded and had access to clinical, imaging, histologic, and biochemical information.   results planar scans depicted 130 neck foci and 17 distant foci. at spect/ct these foci were further characterized as thyroglossal duct and thyroid bed remnant (n = 98), cervical nodal metastasis or local residual disease (n = 26), physiologic activity (n = 11), and distant metastasis (n = 12). interobserver disagreement occurred on eight of 147 foci (5%). because of superior lesion localization and additional anatomic information derived from the low-dose ct component, incremental diagnostic value with spect/ct over planar imaging was found for 70 of 147 foci (47.6%), including 53 of 130 neck foci (40.8%) and all 17 (100%) distant foci. reader confidence increased regarding 104 of 147 foci (70.7%).   conclusion iodine-131 spect/ct is useful for accurate evaluation of regional and distant activity in characterization of foci as residual thyroid tissue or nodal, pulmonary, or osseous metastasis. suspected physiologic mimics of disease can be confirmed with increased reader confidence.
measurement of physical exposure to musculoskeletal disorder risk factors must generally be performed directly in the field to assess the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions. to perform such an evaluation, the reliability of physical exposure measures under similar field conditions must be known. the objectives of this study were to estimate the reliability of physical exposure measures performed in the field and to establish the baseline values of physical exposure in sign language interpreters (sli) before the implementation of an intervention. the electromyography (emg) of the trapezius muscles as well as the wrist motions of the dominant arm were measured using goniometry on nine sli on four different days. several exposure parameters, proposed in the literature, were computed and the generalizability theory was used as a framework to assess reliability. overall, sli showed a relatively low level of trapezius muscle activity, but with little time at rest, and highly dynamic wrist motions. electromyography exposure parameters showed poor to moderate reliability, while goniometry parameter reliability was moderate to excellent. for emg parameters, performing repeated measurements on different days was more effective in increasing reliability than extending the duration of the measurement over one day. for goniometry, repeating measurements on different days was also effective in improving reliability, although good reliability could be obtained with a single sufficiently long measurement period.  the objectives of this study were (a) to determine errors in wrist angle measurements from a commercially available biaxial electrogoniometer and (b) to develop a calibration routine in order to correct for these errors. goniometric measurements were collected simultaneously with true angular data using a fixture that allowed wrist movement in one plane while restricting motion in the orthogonal plane. these data were collected in two sets of trials: flexion/extension with radial/ulnar deviation restricted, and radial/ulnar deviation with flexion/extension restricted. during these trials, we studied discrete 30° increments of forearm rotation. the results showed the expected cross talk and zero drift errors during forearm rotation. the application of mathematical equations that describe the effect of goniometer twist resulted in significant error reduction for most forearm rotations. the calibration technique employs both a slope and a displacement transformation to improve the accuracy of angular data. the calibration technique may be used on data collected in the field if forearm rotation is measured simultaneously with the goniometer data.
arachidonic acid at micromolar concentrations produced a drastic increase of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ros) in rat hepatoma as-30d cells cultivated in vitro along with an increase in the incidence of apoptotic cell death. both processes were prevented by trolox, a water-soluble tocopherol derivative, and tempol, a known antioxidative agent. a synthetic hybrid of lipoic acid and trolox or preincubation with n-acetylcysteine were less effective. preincubation of the cells with etomoxir, a known highly specific irreversible inhibitor of carnitine-palmitoyltransferase i, partly decreased the ros formation induced by arachidonic acid but it did not affect the increase in apoptosis. cumulatively, these results indicate that apoptosis induced in hepatoma cells by arachidonic acid is mediated by ros. they also suggest that this effect is due to arachidonic acid as such and not to its mitochondrial oxidative metabolites.  arachidonic acid and, to a smaller extent, oleic acid at micromolar concentrations decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential within as-30d rat hepatoma cells cultivated in vitro and increased cell respiration. the uncoupling effect of both fatty acids on cell respiration was partly prevented by cyclosporin a, blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. arachidonic acid increased the rate of reactive oxygen species (ros) production, while oleic acid decreased it. both fatty acids induced apoptotic cell death of as-30d cells, accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and association of proapoptotic bax protein with mitochondria; arachidonic acid being a more potent inducer than oleic acid. trolox, a potent antioxidant, prevented ros increase induced by arachidonic acid and protected the cells against apoptosis produced by this fatty acid. it is concluded that arachidonic and oleic acids induce apoptosis of as-30d hepatoma cells by the mitochondrial pathway but differ in the mechanism of their action: arachidonic acid induces apoptosis mainly by stimulating ros production, whereas oleic acid may contribute to programmed cell death by activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
in this paper, we addressed the named entity recognition (ner) problem for morphologically rich languages by employing a semi-supervised learning approach based on neural networks. we adopted a fast unsupervised method for learning continuous vector representations of words, and used these representations along with language independent features to develop a ner system. we evaluated our system for the highly inflectional turkish and czech languages. we improved the state-of-the-art f-score obtained for turkish without using gazetteers by 2.26% and for czech by 1.53%. unlike the previous state-of-the-art systems developed for these languages, our system does not make use of any language dependent features. therefore, we believe it can easily be applied to other morphologically rich languages.  in this paper, we present our effort to consolidate and push further the named entity recognition (ner) research for the czech language. the research in czech is based upon a non-standard basis. some systems are constructed to provide hierarchical outputs whereas the rests give flat entities. direct comparison among these system is therefore impossible. our first goal is to tackle this issue. we build our own ner system based upon conditional random fields (crf) model. it is constructed to output either flat or hierarchical named entities thus enabling an evaluation with all the known systems for czech language. we show a 3.5 – 11% absolute performance increase when compared to previously published results. as a last step we put our system in the context of the research for other languages. we show results for english, spanish and dutch corpora. we can conclude that our system provides solid results when compared to the foreign state of the art.
kawahara i, kuniyasu h, matsuyoshi h, goto k, obata k, misawa h, fujii h, takaki m. comparison of effects of a selective 5-ht reuptake inhibitor versus a 5-ht4 receptor agonist on in vivo neurogenesis at the rectal anastomosis in rats. am j physiol gastrointest liver physiol 302: g588–g597, 2012. first published december 22, 2011; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00284.2011.—it was recently reported that activation of enteric neural 5-ht4 receptors (sr4) promotes reconstruction of enteric neural circuit injury in distal gut of guinea pigs and that this reconstruction involves neural stem cells. we aimed to explore a novel approach using a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri), which increases endogenous 5-ht, to repair enteric nerve fiber injury in the rat distal gut. enteric nerve fiber injury was performed by rectal transection and subsequent end-to-end one-layer anastomosis. the ssri fluvoxamine maleate (100 mol/l) was applied locally at the anastomotic site to compare with the 5-ht4 agonist mosapride citrate (100 mol/l) (applied for patent) applied locally and orally. unlike mosapride, fluvoxamine failed to promote the regeneration of the nerve fiber tract across the anastomosis. furthermore, fluvoxamine did not generate antidistal-less homeobox 2 (dlx2)and anti-sr4-positive cells (neural stem cells) and/or anti-neurofilament (nf)-positive cells (neural cells) in newly formed granulation tissue at the anastomosis, whereas these cell types were observed in mosapride-treated preparations. in contrast to its effects in guinea pigs, mosapride generated 5-bromo-2=-deoxyuridine (brdu)-positive neural cells in ganglia sites 3 mm oral and anal from the anastomosis 2 wk after nerve fiber injury. all actions of mosapride were observed after local and or oral applications. these findings indicate that local ssri treatment does not induce in vivo nerve fiber tract growth across the anastomosis in the rat distal gut. mosapride induces nerve fiber tract growth across the anastomosis, mediated through enteric neural stem cells possibly from neural crest-derived stem cells or mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow.  moderate rectal distension elicits recto-rectal reflex contractions and simultaneous recto-internal anal sphincter reflex relaxations that together comprise the defecation reflex. both reflexes are controlled by 1) pelvic nerves, 2) lumbar colonic nerves, and 3) enteric nervous system. the aim of the present study was to explore a novel approach to repairing the defecation reflex dysfunction by using the plasticity of enteric nervous pathways. experiments were performed in anesthetized guinea pigs with ethyl carbamate. the rectum 30 mm oral from the anal verge was transected without damage to extrinsic nerves, and subsequent end-to-end one-layer anastomosis was performed. recovery of the defecation reflex and associated reflex pathways were evaluated. eight weeks after sectioning of intrinsic reflex nerve pathways in the rectum, the defecation reflex recovered to the control level, accompanied with regeneration of reflex pathways. the 5-ht(4)-receptor agonist mosapride (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced the recovered defecation reflex 8 wk after surgery. two weeks after local treatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf: 10(-6) g/ml) at the rectal anastomotic site, the recto-internal anal sphincter reflex relaxations recovered and some bundles of fine nerve fibers were shown to interconnect the oral and anal ends of the myenteric plexus. these results suggested a possibility for repairing the anal dysfunction by promoting regeneration of the reflex pathways in the enteric nervous system with local application of bdnf.
mating systems can vary among species and populations and thus influence evolutionary trajectories, ecological traits, and population demography. the siring of offspring by an extrapair male, or extrapair paternity (epp), is a widespread and varied phenomenon in all vertebrate classes. however, we do not understand all of the factors associated with variation in epp rates. the breeding synchrony hypothesis suggests that epp rates should increase with latitude and elevation, whereas the paternal care hypothesis predicts that epp rates should decrease with elevation. to address these hypotheses, we investigated how population epp rates vary over elevation and latitude in emberizid sparrows. in comparative analyses including the effects of phylogeny, the relationship between epp rates and elevation depended on latitude. epp rates were greater in higher-latitude populations. but within higher-latitude populations, epp rates decreased with increasing elevation. these findings provide support for both the breeding synchrony and paternal care hypotheses, suggesting that in lower-latitude, higher-elevation populations, the need for male parental care does not outweigh the benefits of seeking extrapair fertilizations in populations with relatively synchronous breeding. in contrast, at higher-latitude, higher-elevation sites, the need for male parental care is greater and might drive lower rates of extrapair mating despite highly synchronous breeding.  comprehensive, accurate paternity assignment is critical to answering numerous questions in evolutionary ecology. yet, most studies of species with extra‐pair paternity (epp) fail to assign sires to all offspring. common limitations include incomplete and biased sampling of offspring and males, particularly with respect to male location and social status, potentially biasing estimated patterns of paternity. studies that achieve comprehensive sampling and paternity assignment are therefore required. accordingly, we genotyped virtually all males and >99% of 6‐day‐old offspring over 16 years in a song sparrow (melospiza melodia) population and used three complementary statistical methodologies to attempt complete paternity assignment for all 2207 offspring. assignments were highly consistent across maximum likelihood methods that used solely genotype data, and heuristic and integrated bayesian analyses that included data describing individual locations. sires were assigned to >99% of all genotyped offspring with ≥95% confidence, revealing an epp rate of c. 28%. extra‐pair sires primarily occupied territories neighbouring their extra‐pair offspring; spatial location was therefore highly informative for paternity assignment. epp was biased towards paired territorial males, although unpaired territorial and floater males sired c. 13% of extra‐pair offspring. failing to sample and include unpaired males as candidate sires would therefore substantially reduce assignment rates. these analyses demonstrate the integration of genetic and ecological information to achieve comprehensive paternity assignment and direct biological insight, illustrate the potential biases that common forms of incomplete sampling could have on estimated patterns of epp, and provide an essential basis for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of epp.
background typhoid fever, caused by the gram-negative bacterium salmonella enterica serovar typhi, is a major cause of community-acquired bacteremia and death worldwide. s100a8 (mrp8) and s100a9 (mrp14) form bioactive antimicrobial heterodimers (calprotectin) that can activate toll-like receptor 4, promoting lethal, endotoxin-induced shock and multi-organ failure. we aimed to characterize the expression and function of s100a8/a9 in patients with typhoid fever and in a murine invasive salmonella model. methods and principal findings s100a8/a9 protein levels were determined in acute phase plasma or feces from 28 bangladeshi patients, and convalescent phase plasma from 60 indonesian patients with blood culture or pcr-confirmed typhoid fever, and compared to 98 healthy control subjects. to functionally characterize the role of s100a8/a9, we challenged wildtype (wt) and s100a9-/- mice with s. typhimurium and determined bacterial loads and inflammation 2- and 5- days post infection. we further assessed the antimicrobial function of recombinant s100a8/a9 on s. typhimurium and s. typhi replication in vitro. typhoid fever patients demonstrated a marked increase of s100a8/a9 in acute phase plasma and feces and this increases correlated with duration of fever prior to admission. s100a8/a9 directly inhibited the growth of s. typhimurium and s. typhi in vitro in a dose and time dependent fashion. wt mice inoculated with s. typhimurium showed increased levels of s100a8/a9 in both the liver and the systemic compartment but s100a9-/- mice were indistinguishable from wt mice with respect to bacterial growth, survival, and inflammatory responses, as determined by cytokine release, histopathology and organ injury. conclusion s100a8/a9 is markedly elevated in human typhoid, correlates with duration of fever prior to admission and directly inhibits the growth of s. typhimurium and s. typhi in vitro. despite elevated levels in the murine invasive salmonella model, s100a8/a9 does not contribute to an effective host response against s. typhimurium in mice.  the discovery of toll-like receptors (tlrs) as components that recognize conserved structures in pathogens has greatly advanced understanding of how the body senses pathogen invasion, triggers innate immune responses and primes antigen-specific adaptive immunity. although tlrs are critical for host defense, it has become apparent that loss of negative regulation of tlr signaling, as well as recognition of self molecules by tlrs, are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. furthermore, it is now clear that the interaction between tlrs and recently identified cytosolic innate immune sensors is crucial for mounting effective immune responses. here we describe the recent advances that have been made by research into the role of tlr biology in host defense and disease.
we have previously demonstrated that infection by coxsackievirus b3 (cvb3), a positive-stranded rna enterovirus, results in the accumulation of insoluble ubiquitin–protein aggregates, which resembles the common feature of neurodegenerative diseases. the importance of protein aggregation in viral pathogenesis has been recognized; however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain ill-defined. transactive response dna-binding protein-43 (tdp-43) is an rna-binding protein that has an essential role in regulating rna metabolism at multiple levels. cleavage and cytoplasmic aggregation of tdp-43 serves as a major molecular marker for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration and contributes significantly to disease progression. in this study, we reported that tdp-43 is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during cvb3 infection through the activity of viral protease 2a, followed by the cleavage mediated by viral protease 3c. cytoplasmic translocation of tdp-43 is accompanied by reduced solubility and increased formation of protein aggregates. the cleavage takes place at amino-acid 327 between glutamine and alanine, resulting in the generation of an n- and c-terminal cleavage fragment of ~35 and ~8 kda, respectively. the c-terminal product of tdp-43 is unstable and quickly degraded through the proteasome degradation pathway, whereas the n-terminal truncation of tdp-43 acts as a dominant-negative mutant that inhibits the function of native tdp-43 in alternative rna splicing. lastly, we demonstrated that knockdown of tdp-43 results in an increase in viral titers, suggesting a protective role for tdp-43 in cvb3 infection. taken together, our findings suggest a novel model by which cytoplasmic redistribution and cleavage of tdp-43 as a consequence of cvb3 infection disrupts the solubility and transcriptional activity of tdp-43. our results also reveal a mechanism evolved by enteroviruses to support efficient viral infection.  ubiquitin-positive, tau- and α-synuclein–negative inclusions are hallmarks of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. although the identity of the ubiquitinated protein specific to either disorder was unknown, we showed that tdp-43 is the major disease protein in both disorders. pathologic tdp-43 was hyper-phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved to generate c-terminal fragments and was recovered only from affected central nervous system regions, including hippocampus, neocortex, and spinal cord. tdp-43 represents the common pathologic substrate linking these neurodegenerative disorders.
study question does fibronectin (fn) stimulate the sperm capacitation process in humans?   summary answer fibronectin stimulates human sperm capacitation.   what is known already capacitation is a process that occurs in the oviduct. it has been suggested that some molecules present in the oviductal fluid and cells as well as proteins present in the cumulus oophorus could be involved in the modulation of sperm function and their acquisition of fertilizing capacity. fibronectin is a glycoprotein that is present in the fluid and the oviduct epithelium, and its receptor (alpha 5 beta 1 integrin) is present in human sperm. when alpha 5 beta 1 (α5β1) integrin binds to fibronectin, intracellular signals similar to the process of sperm capacitation are activated.   study design, size, duration human sperm were selected via a percoll gradient and were then incubated in non-capacitated medium (ncm) or reconstituted capacitated medium (rcm), in the presence or absence of fibronectin for different time periods. a total of 39 donors were used during the study, which lasted 3 years.   participants/materials, setting, methods freshly ejaculated sperm from healthy volunteers were obtained by masturbation. all semen samples were normal according to the world health organization parameters. six approaches were used to determine the effects of fibronectin on sperm capacitation: chlortetracycline (ctc) assay, heterologous co-culture of human sperm with bovine oviductal epithelial cells (boec), measurement of cyclic (c) amp levels, activity of protein kinase a (pka), phosphorylation of proteins in tyrosine (tyr) residues, and induction of acrosome reaction with progesterone.   main results and the role of chance when sperm were incubated in rcm in the presence of fn, we observed differences with respect to sperm incubated in rcm without fn (control): (i) a 10% increase in the percentage of sperm with the b pattern (capacitated sperm) of ctc fluorescence from the beginning of capacitation (p < 0.001); (ii) an effect on both the concentration of camp (p < 0.05) and pka activity (p < 0.05) during early capacitation; (iii) an increase in the degree of phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues after 60 min of capacitation (p < 0.01); (iv) an increase in the percentage of acrosome-reacted sperm in response to progesterone (p < 0.05); and (v) a decrease in the percentage of sperm attached to boec (p < 0.05). moreover, we noted that the effect of fn was specific and mediated by alpha 5 beta 1 integrin (p < 0.001). fn by itself had no effect on sperm capacitation.   limitations, reasons for caution this study was carried out with sperm from young adult men. men with abnormal semen samples were excluded. the results cannot be directly extrapolated to other mammalian species.   wider implications of the findings currently, male subfertility has become a huge public health problem, which makes it imperative to develop new treatments. this is a novel discovery that extends our current knowledge concerning normal and pathological sperm physiology as well as events that regulate the process of fertilization.   study funding/competing interests this study was supported by grants from fondecyt (1130341, e.s.d. and 1120056, p.m.) and foncyt (pip 2011-0496, s.p.-m). the authors have no conflicts of interest.  signal transduction pathways regulate various aspects of mammalian sperm function. when human sperm were incubated in a medium supporting capacitation, proteins became tyrosine-phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner. this phosphorylation was inhibited by genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor. phosphorylation was also reduced when sperm were incubated either in the presence of increasing concentrations of extracellular ca2+ or in a medium containing the ca2+ ionophore a23187. this ca2+-induced dephosphorylation was calmodulin-dependent, suggesting that calcineurin was involved. in this regard, the calcineurin inhibitor deltamethrin inhibited the ca2+ ionophore-induced dephosphorylation. a limited number of mr 80,000-105,000 polypeptides were the most prominent phosphotyrosine-containing proteins present in human sperm. unlike mouse sperm, which contains a tyrosine-phosphorylated isoform of hexokinase, a phosphotyrosine-containing hexokinase in human sperm was not detected. most of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were triton x-100-insoluble and were localized to the principal piece of the flagellum, the region where the cytoskeletal fibrous sheath is found. prominent phosphotyrosine-containing proteins of mr 82,000 and 97,000 were identified as the human homologues of mouse sperm akap82, the major fibrous sheath protein, and pro-akap82, its precursor polypeptide, respectively. these proteins are a kinase anchor proteins, polypeptides that sequester protein kinase a to subcellular locations. taken together, these results suggest that protein tyrosine phosphorylation may be part of a signal transduction cascade(s) regulating events pertaining to capacitation and/or motility in mammalian sperm and that an interrelationship between tyrosine kinase and camp signaling pathways exists in these cells.
alternative polyadenylation (apa) is a widespread gene regulatory mechanism that generates mrnas with different 3′-ends, allowing them to interact with different sets of rna regulators such as micrornas and rna-binding proteins. recent studies have shown that during development, neural tissues produce mrnas with particularly long 3′utrs, suggesting that such extensions might be important for neural development and function. despite this, the mechanisms underlying neural apa are not well understood. here, we investigate this problem within the drosophila nervous system, focusing on the roles played by general cleavage and polyadenylation factors (cpa factors). in particular, we examine the model that modulations in cpa factor concentration may affect apa during development. for this, we first analyse the expression of the drosophila orthologues of all mammalian cpa factors and note that their expression decreases during embryogenesis. in contrast to this global developmental decrease in cpa factor expression, we see that cleavage factor i (cfi) expression is actually elevated in the late embryonic central nervous system, suggesting that cfi might play a special role in neural tissues. to test this, we use the uas/gal4 system to deplete cfi proteins from neural tissue and observe that in this condition, multiple genes switch their apa patterns, demonstrating a role of cfi in apa control during drosophila neural development. furthermore, analysis of genes with 3′utr extensions of different length leads us to suggest a novel relation between 3′utr length and sensitivity to cpa factor expression. our work thus contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms of apa control within the developing central nervous system.  cleavage factor i(m) (cfi(m)) is a highly conserved component of the eukaryotic mrna 3' processing machinery that functions in sequence-specific poly(a) site recognition through the collaboration of a 25 kda subunit containing a nudix domain and a larger subunit of 59, 68, or 72 kda containing an rna recognition motif (rrm). our previous work demonstrated that cfi(m)25 is both necessary and sufficient for sequence-specific binding of the poly(a) site upstream element ugua. here, we report the crystal structure of cfi(m)25 complexed with the rrm domain of cfi(m)68 and rna. the cfi(m)25 dimer is clasped on opposite sides by two cfi(m)68 rrm domains. each cfi(m)25 subunit binds one ugua element specifically. biochemical analysis indicates that the cfi(m)68 rrms serve to enhance rna binding and facilitate rna looping. the intrinsic ability of cfi(m) to direct rna looping may provide a mechanism for its function in the regulation of alternative poly(a) site selection.
abstract context. variable demographic rates can manifest themselves between habitat types in the form of source–sink dynamics where populations in sink habitats would not exist without the addition of migrants from source habitats. aims. arctic ground squirrels (urocitellus parryii pleisus (osgood, 1900)) occupy a large geographic area in northern canada and live in a variety of habitat types, including boreal forest, low-elevation meadows and alpine meadows, providing an opportunity to investigate the possible existence of source–sink dynamics. methods. we hypothesised that arctic ground squirrels in the south-western yukon exhibit demographic characteristics indicative of source–sink dynamics. boreal forest habitat could be a sink in spite of previous high squirrel densities, whereas meadows could be a source. we investigated this by mark–recapture live-trapping and radio-telemetry. key results. in the boreal forest in the kluane region, we found reduced recruitment, reduced population growth rates (λ), and reduced survivorship for radio-collared individuals that moved from low-elevation meadows into the boreal forest. there was no evidence from radio-collared juveniles of dispersal from high-density ground squirrel populations in alpine meadows down into boreal forest. conclusions. boreal forest is a sink habitat for arctic ground squirrels. source–sink dynamics observed between low-elevation meadow and boreal forest habitats appear to result from increased predation pressure in the boreal forest. the result has been a near extirpation of boreal forest arctic ground squirrels in the kluane region since 1998. implications. because the source areas of low-elevation meadows occupy only 7–9% of the lowland habitat, recolonisation of boreal forest sites has been very slow. whereas alpine populations remain high in 2011, boreal forest populations remain near zero. alpine populations do not appear to be a source for the boreal forest.  nous avons etudie les sousliks arctiques (urocitellus parryii plesius (osgood, 1900); anterieurement spermophilus parryii plesius osgood, 1900) dans trois types d'habitat distincts (la foret boreale, les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines) dans la region de kluane dans le sud-ouest du territoire du yukon, canada, de 2008 a 2010, afin de determiner si les populations de ces differents habitats presentaient des repartitions et des abondances specifiques aux habitats. on a demontre que leur abondance dans la foret boreale est synchronisee avec le cycle des lievres d'amerique (lepus americanus erxleben, 1777) dans la region a cause de leurs predateurs communs. nous avons predit que les populations dans la foret boreale devraient etre basses a cause du minimum actuel dans le cycle des lievres d'amerique, mais que les sousliks devraient etre relativement abondants dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines. les densites en fin d'ete differaient significativement entre les divers types d'habitats, avec 0,38 ± 0.13 souslik/ha (moyenne ± 1 es) dans l'habitat de foret boreale, 1,25 ± 0,22 souslik/ha dans l'habitat de prairie basse et 5,7 ± 0,22 sousliks/ha dans l'habitat de prairie alpine. en 2009, les populations ont ete extirpees de l'habitat de foret boreale, alors que les densites dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines etaient respectivement de 1,6 ± 0,34 souslik/ha et de 6,1 ± 0,7 sousliks/ha. l'absence actuelle de sousliks dans la foret boreale et la persistance des populations dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines laissent croire a l'existence d'une dynamique de type source-puits entre les types d'habitats de foret boreale et de prairie.
membrane-type (mt) 1 matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) is up-regulated in many tumor types and has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. mt1-mmp is critical for pericellular degradation of the extracellular matrix, thereby promoting tumor cell invasion and dissemination. to grow efficiently in vivo, tumor cells induce angiogenesis in both primary solid tumors and metastatic foci. the present study describes a functional link between the expression of mt1-mmp and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) production in human glioma u251 xenografts in athymic mice. to investigate the effects of mt1-mmp on vegf expression, u251 cells were stably transfected with mt1-mmp to generate the u-mt cell line overexpressing the enzyme. in vitro, the u-mt cells had an increased rate of proliferation and migration as well as the ability to activate the mmp-2 proenzyme and directionally remodel a three-dimensional collagen matrix. these findings suggested higher tumorigenicity of u-mt cells relative to the vector-control u-neo cells. in agreement with the in vitro data, u-mt xenografts in balb/c nu/nu mice displayed markedly increased growth rates and elevated levels of angiogenesis. in contrast, u-neo cells formed small, minimally vascularized tumors. the elevated angiogenesis in u-mt xenografts was associated with an up-regulation of vegf expression in tumor cells. in addition, u-mt cells in vitro secreted twice as much vegf as the control cells. gm6001, a hydroxamate inhibitor of mmp activity, down-regulated the production of vegf in u-mt cells to the levels observed in the u-neo control. our results demonstrate that the enhanced tumorigenicity of glioma cells overexpressing mt1-mmp involves stimulation of angiogenesis through the up-regulation of vegf production.  angiogenesis is the process in which new vessels emerge from existing endothelial lined vessels. this is distinct from the process of vasculogenesis in that the endothelial cells arise by proliferation from existing vessels rather than differentiating from stem cells. angiogenesis is an invasive process that requires proteolysis of the extracellular matrix and, proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, as well as synthesis of new matrix components. during embryonic development, both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis contribute to formation of the circulatory system. in the adult, with the single exception of the reproductive cycle in women, angiogenesis is initiated only in response to a pathologic condition, such as inflammation or hypoxia. the angiogenic response is critical for progression of wound healing and rheumatoid arthritis. angiogenesis is also a prerequisite for tumor growth and metastasis formation. therefore, understanding the cellular events involved in angiogenesis and the molecular regulation of these events has enormous clinical implications. this understanding is providing novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including cancer.
objective: reports on heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (hit) in paediatrics are confined to isolated case reports. the objective was to systematically combine the published data. design and setting: cases were identified by medline search and review of bibliographies. patients: we included subjects reported with hit, collecting patient demographics, clinical and laboratory characteristics, therapeutic regimens and outcomes. measurements and results: reports on 70 patients were retrieved. in a majority of children, hit occurred during hospitalisation in a paediatric icu. in most patients, the typical onset pattern was reported, although rapid-onset-pattern hit occurred in some. the median platelet-count nadir was 54×109/l; 11% of reported patients had nadirs in the normal range. clinical symptoms included isolated thrombocytopenia and solitary or combined venous, arterial and intracardiac thromboembolism, sometimes catheter-related. pulmonary embolism and major bleeding were rarely described. confirmatory functional or antigenic testing of hit antibodies showed a similar cumulative sensitivity of about 88%. an unfavourable outcome (death/limb amputation) was reported in 42.1% of patients without therapy and in 18% of patients treated with danaparoid, lepirudin, or argatroban. conclusions: hit in children mainly occurs in paediatric intensive care with diagnostic features and outcomes similar to those seen in adults. hit cannot be ruled out based on normal platelet counts or occurrence after fewer than 5 days of heparin exposure. children should be presumed to suffer from hit based on clinical grounds and treated accordingly (immediate heparin withdrawal and alternative anticoagulation). alternative anticoagulation with danaparoid, lepirudin and argatroban appears to improve outcomes.  we report on four children with heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia type ii. in three patients, therapy with unfractionated heparin was associated with development of cardiac thrombi or with thrombosis progression up to the inferior vena cava or with aggravation of peripheral arterial occlusion. in the fourth child, the disease was recognized early on, and no complication occurred. heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia type ii was confirmed by heparin‐induced platelet activation assay and/or heparin/platelet factor 4‐elisa. concomitant elevated antiphospholipid antibodies were seen in all patients. danaparoid sodium applied at a dosage of between 1.2 and 7.1 u/kg/h stopped the disease progression in each patient. three children had a clinical recovery with partial recanalization, but for the child with peripheral arterial occlusion disease, amputation of some of the toes became necessary.
the formation of human capital is important for a society’s welfare and economic success. recent literature shows that child health can provide an important explanation for disparities in children’s human capital development across different socio-economic groups. while this literature focuses on cognitive skills as determinants of human capital, it neglects non-cognitive skills. we analyze data from economic experiments with preschoolers and their mothers to investigate whether child health can explain developmental gaps in children’s non-cognitive skills. our measure for children’s non-cognitive skills is their willingness to compete with others. our findings suggest that health problems are negatively related to children’s willingness to compete and that the effect of health on competitiveness differs with socio-economic background. health has a strongly negative effect in our sub-sample with low socio-economic background, whereas there is no effect in our sub-sample with high socio-economic background.  this paper introduces a three-item "cognitive reflection test" (crt) as a simple measure of one type of cognitive ability—the ability or disposition to reflect on a question and resist reporting the first response that comes to mind. the author will show that crt scores are predictive of the types of choices that feature prominently in tests of decision-making theories, like expected utility theory and prospect theory. indeed, the relation is sometimes so strong that the preferences themselves effectively function as expressions of cognitive ability—an empirical fact begging for a theoretical explanation. the author examines the relation between crt scores and two important decision-making characteristics: time preference and risk preference. the crt scores are then compared with other measures of cognitive ability or cognitive "style." the crt scores exhibit considerable difference between men and women and the article explores how this relates to sex differences in time and risk preferences. the final section addresses the interpretation of correlations between cognitive abilities and decision-making characteristics.
supervised 3d reconstruction has witnessed a significant progress through the use of deep neural networks. however, this increase in performance requires large scale annotations of 2d/3d data. in this paper, we explore inexpensive 2d supervision as an alternative for expensive 3d cad annotation. specifically, we use foreground masks as weak supervision through a raytrace pooling layer that enables perspective projection and backpropagation. additionally, since the 3d reconstruction from masks is an ill posed problem, we propose to constrain the 3d reconstruction to the manifold of unlabeled realistic 3d shapes that match mask observations. we demonstrate that learning a log-barrier solution to this constrained optimization problem resembles the gan objective, enabling the use of existing tools for training gans. we evaluate and analyze the manifold constrained reconstruction on various datasets for single and multi-view reconstruction of both synthetic and real images.  inspired by the recent success of methods that employ shape priors to achieve robust 3d reconstructions, we propose a novel recurrent neural network architecture that we call the 3d recurrent reconstruction neural network (3d-r2n2). the network learns a mapping from images of objects to their underlying 3d shapes from a large collection of synthetic data [13]. our network takes in one or more images of an object instance from arbitrary viewpoints and outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3d occupancy grid. unlike most of the previous works, our network does not require any image annotations or object class labels for training or testing. our extensive experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for single view reconstruction, and (ii) enables the 3d reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional sfm/slam methods fail (because of lack of texture and/or wide baseline).
imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging seek to estimate neural signals in local brain regions through measurements of hemodynamic activity. however, hemodynamic activity is accompanied by large vascular fluctuations of unclear significance. to characterize these fluctuations and their impact on estimates of neural signals, we used optical imaging in visual cortex of awake mice. we found that hemodynamic activity can be expressed as the sum of two components, one local and one global. the local component reflected presumed neural signals driven by visual stimuli in the appropriate retinotopic region. the global component constituted large fluctuations shared by larger cortical regions, which extend beyond visual cortex. these fluctuations varied from trial to trial, but they did not constitute noise; they correlated with pupil diameter, suggesting that they reflect variations in arousal or alertness. distinguishing local and global contributions to hemodynamic activity may help understand neurovascular coupling and interpret measurements of hemodynamic responses.  potential contributions of concurrently acquired pupil dilation data to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) experiments were examined. sixteen healthy participants completed a working memory task (digit sorting) during measurement of pupil dilation outside the fmri environment and during concurrent 3t fmri assessment. pupil dilation increased parametrically with task difficulty inside and outside the scanner, on a similar time course, suggesting that task demand was similar in both environments. the time course of pupil dilation during digit sorting was similar to the time course of the fmri signal in the middle frontal gyrus, suggesting that middle-frontal gyrus activity indexed the engagement working memory processes. incorporating individual differences in pupil dilation improved the sensitivity and specificity of general linear modeling analyses of activity in the middle frontal gyrus, above and beyond standard analytic techniques. results suggest concurrent pupil dilation during fmri assessment can help to (1) specify whether task demand is the same inside and outside the fmri environment, (2) resolve the extent to which fmri signals reflect different aspects of event-related designs, and (3) explain variation in fmri data due to individual differences in information processing.
in most large-scale distributed applications, publish/subscribe (p/s) systems allow a decoupling between senders and receivers to interact with publishers and subscribers. recently, in these areas, there has been increasing emphasis in managing end-to-end message delivery performance and message order-based consistency, which have been addressed in distributed collaborative applications. especially, a causally ordered delivery consistency is more useful for these applications in which a large number of processes request collaboratively and interactively. in p/s systems of wireless sensor networks (wsns), data fusion, the process of correlating individual sensor readings into high-level sensing results, depends on a causally ordered delivery. and gossip protocols based on p/s systems are becoming one of the promising solutions for addressing p/s scalability problems and very useful for the applications with a mixture of diverse message order consistencies. in this paper, we present two versions of causally ordered delivery protocols based on p/s systems using gossip protocols. the one is that only the predecessors immediately before the multicast message are disseminated from brokers to subscribers. and the other, specifically for p/s systems of wsns, is that the timestamps that represent the gossip round in which the immediate predecessors are generated are disseminated from brokers to subscribers. the features of these two versions might be highly scalable and suitable for the area of the applications requiring only the minimum causal information with flexible consistency.  with the sharp increase in heterogeneity and distribution of elements in wide-area networks, more flexible, efficient and autonomous approaches for management and information distribution are needed. this paper proposes a novel approach, based on gossip protocols and firefly synchronisation theory, for the management policy distribution and synchronisation over a number of nodes in an application level active network (alan). the work is presented in the context of the ist project android (active network distributed open infrastructure development), which is developing an autonomous policy-based management system for alan. the preliminary simulation results suggest that with the appropriately optimised parameters, the algorithms developed are scalable, can work effectively in a realistic random network, and allow the policy updates to be distributed efficiently throughout the active network with a lower latency than other similar types of gossip protocols.
dendritic cell (dc)-based vaccinations represent a promising approach for the immunotherapy of cancer and infectious diseases as dcs play an essential role in initiating cellular immune responses. a number of clinical trials using ex vivo-generated dcs have been performed so far and only minor toxicity has been reported. both the induction of antigen-specific t cells and clinical responses have been observed in vaccinated cancer patients. nevertheless, dc-based immunotherapy is still in its infancy and there are many issues to be addressed such as antigen loading procedures, dc source and maturational state, migration properties, route, frequency, and dosage of dc vaccination. the increasing knowledge of dc biology should be used to improve the efficacy of this new therapy.  immunotherapies for human autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases are proliferating rapidly, and with these changes comes the opportunity to monitor patients for immune responses to therapy based on early surrogate markers for clinical responses. class ii tetramers have the potential to serve as these sorts of markers for immune monitoring, and thereby assist with patient management, therapy selection, and improved outcomes. however, important issues of tcr avidity require resolution, because much is still unknown regarding location, quantitation, and characterization of the human t cell response. opportunities for application of tetramer technologies in the near future will enable both clinical progress and the development of new insights into human cd4+ t cell biology in vivo.
community health workers (chws) have gained national recognition for their role in addressing health disparities and are increasingly integrated into the health care delivery system. there is a lack of consensus, however, regarding empirical evidence on the impact of chw interventions on health outcomes. in this paper, we present results from the 2010 national community health worker advocacy survey (nchwas) in an effort to strengthen a generalized understanding of the chw profession that can be integrated into ongoing efforts to improve the health care delivery system. results indicate that regardless of geographical location, work setting, and demographic characteristics, chws generally share similar professional characteristics, training preparation, and job activities. chws are likely to be female, representative of the community they serve, and to work in community health centers, clinics, community-based organizations, and health departments. the most common type of training is on-the-job and conference training. most chws work with clients, groups, other chws and less frequently community leaders to address health issues, the most common of which are chronic disease, prevention and health care access. descriptions of chw activities documented in the survey demonstrate that chws apply core competencies in a synergistic manner in an effort to assure that their clients get the services they need. nchwas findings suggest that over the past 50 years, the chw field has become standardized in response to the unmet needs of their communities. in research and practice, the field would benefit from being considered a health profession rather than an intervention.  the community health worker model is recognized nationally as a means to address glaring inequities in the burden of adverse health conditions that exist among specific population groups in the united states. this study explored arizona chw involvement in advocacy beyond the individual patient level into the realm of advocating for community level change as a mechanism to reduce the structural underpinnings of health disparities. a survey of chws in arizona found that chws advocate at local, state and federal political levels as well as within health and social service agencies and business. characteristics significantly associated with advocacy include employment in a not for profit organization, previous leadership training, and a work environment that allows flexible work hours and the autonomy to start new projects at work. intrinsic characteristics of chws associated with advocacy include their belief that they can influence community decisions, self perception that they are leaders in the community, and knowledge of who to talk to in their community to make change. community-level advocacy has been identified as a core chw function and has the potential to address structural issues such as poverty, employment, housing, and discrimination. agencies utilizing the chw model could encourage community advocacy by providing a flexible working environment, ongoing leadership training, and opportunities to collaborate with both veteran chws and local community leaders. further research is needed to understand the nature and impact of chw community advocacy activities on both systems change and health outcomes.
backgroundoculocutaneous albinism (oca) is a clinically and genetically heterogenic group of pigmentation abnormalities characterized by variable hair, skin, and ocular hypopigmentation. six known genes and a locus on human chromosome 4q24 have been implicated in the etiology of isolated oca forms (oca 1–7).methodsthe most frequent oca types among caucasians are oca1, oca2, and oca4. we aimed to investigate genes responsible for the development of these oca forms in hungarian oca patients (n = 13). mutation screening and polymorphism analysis were performed by direct sequencing on tyr, oca2, slc45a2 genes.resultsalthough the clinical features of the investigated hungarian oca patients were identical, the molecular genetic data suggested oca1 subtype in eight cases and oca4 subtype in two cases. the molecular diagnosis was not clearly identifiable in three cases. in four patients, two different heterozygous known pathogenic or predicted to be pathogenic mutations were present. seven patients had only one pathogenic mutation, which was associated with non-pathogenic variants in six cases. in two patients no pathogenic mutation was identified.conclusionsour results suggest that the concomitant screening of the non-pathogenic variants—which alone do not cause the development of oca, but might have clinical significance in association with a pathogenic variant—is important. our results also show significant variation in the disease spectrum compared to other populations. these data also confirm that the concomitant analysis of oca genes is critical, providing new insights to the phenotypic diversity of oca and expanding the mutation spectrum of oca genes in hungarian patients.  oculocutaneous albinism (oca) is a rare genetic disorder of melanin synthesis that results in hypopigmented hair, skin, and eyes. there are four types of oca caused by mutations in tyr (oca‐1), oca2 (oca‐2), tyrp1 (oca‐3), or slc45a2 (oca‐4). here we report 22 novel mutations in the oca genes; 14 from a cohort of 61 patients seen as part of the nih oca natural history study and eight from a prior study at the university of minnesota. we also include a comprehensive list of almost 600 previously reported oca mutations along with ethnicity information, carrier frequencies, and in silico pathogenicity predictions as a supplement. in addition to discussing the clinical and molecular features of oca, we address the cases of apparent missing heritability. in our cohort, 26% of patients did not have two mutations in a single oca gene. we demonstrate the utility of multiple detection methods to reveal mutations missed by sanger sequencing. finally, we review the tyr p.r402q temperature‐sensitive variant and confirm its association with cases of albinism with only one identifiable tyr mutation.
abstract background: b-natriuretic peptide (bnp) and aminoterminal probnp (nt-probnp) are clinically useful for the diagnosis of decompensated heart failure and for prognosis in heart failure and acute coronary syndromes. clinical use of these biomarkers in critically ill patients being treated in intensive care is not well established. methods: this is a narrative review of evidence identified searching medline with the strategy [(bnp or nt-probnp) and (critical illness and intensive care)]. seven primary reports and two narrative reviews were retrieved. for completeness, literature from each of the following searches was reviewed: [(bnp or nt-probnp) and (critical illness)] and [(bnp or nt-probnp) and (intensive care)]. results: primary literature used bnp and nt-probnp for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring. for diagnosis of acute lung injury in unselected intensive care patients and for diagnosis of heart failure in trauma patients, the biomarkers had low sensitivity and are of modest use. bnp and nt-probnp were found to have a significant ability to prognosticate adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. a single paper examined the use of bnp as a non-invasive replacement for pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, finding little value. the impact of renal insufficiency on the markers was noted as a confounder in most studies. in the secondary searches, some preliminary data suggested a possible role for the natriuretic peptides in exclusion of a cardiac cause for certain conditions among intensive care unit (icu) patients. however, the general findings were that the performance of bnp and nt-probnp is unimpressive among icu patients. conclusions: currently, utilization of bnp and nt-probnp does not appear to provide much useful information or have a substantial role in the care of critically ill patients in intensive care. clin chem lab med 2008;46:1524–32.  objective:the role of plasma b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) in critically ill patients with acute pulmonary edema is controversial. we postulated that a low bnp level would exclude cardiac dysfunction as the principal cause of pulmonary edema and therefore help in the diagnosis of acute lung injury. design:a retrospective derivation cohort was followed by a prospective validation cohort of consecutive patients with acute pulmonary edema admitted to three intensive care units. bnp was measured within 24 hrs from onset. critical care experts blinded to bnp results integrated clinical data with the course of disease and response to therapy and served as the reference standard. setting:three intensive care units at the tertiary center. patients:consecutive critically ill patients with acute pulmonary edema. interventions:none. measurements and main results:in a derivation cohort of 84 patients, a bnp threshold of ≤250 pg/ml had a specificity of 87% and sensitivity of 48% for the diagnosis of acute lung injury. high specificity of bnp (90%, likelihood ratio of 3.9) was confirmed in a validation cohort of 120 consecutive patients, 52 (43%) of whom had acute lung injury. notably, 32% of patients with acute lung injury had concomitant cardiac dysfunction. the median time from the onset of pulmonary edema to bnp testing was 3 hrs. the accuracy of bnp (area under receiver operator curve, 0.71) was comparable with pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (area under receiver operator curve, 0.66) and superior to ejection fraction (area under receiver operator curve, 0.60) in subgroups of patients in whom these tests were performed. the accuracy of bnp improved when patients with renal insufficiency were excluded (area under receiver operator curve, 0.82). conclusion:when measured early after the onset of acute pulmonary edema, a bnp level of <250 pg/ml supports the diagnosis of acute lung injury. the high rate of cardiac and renal dysfunction in critically ill patients limits the discriminative role of bnp. no level of bnp could completely exclude cardiac dysfunction.
objective the purpose of this study was to describe changes of health status as perceived by clients with hand or wrist impairments who received rehabilitation in acute, orthopedic outpatient facilities from occupational therapy or physical therapy personnel.   method one thousand three hundred ninety-nine adults with wrist (n = 692) or hand (n = 707) impairments who were treated between july 1996 and june 1997 were selected from the focus on therapeutic outcomes, inc. (foto) national rehabilitation database. each client completed a health status questionnaire on intake and discharge. data consisted of number of outpatient visits, duration of treatment episode, and health status scores for six functional scales. measures of intensity, global health status, global utilization, and client satisfaction were calculated. outcomes were evaluated across occupational therapists and physical therapists.   results clients perceived improvement (p < .05) in their health status over the course of therapy. number of visits and measures of health status and client satisfaction were similar across type of therapist. episode duration was longer (p < .05) and intensity was less (p < .05) for clients seen by occupational therapists.   conclusion clients receiving rehabilitation in acute orthopedic outpatient centers perceived improvement in their functional abilities and health and well-being (global health status and individual functional scales) over the time during which treatment was provided. results confirm the responsiveness of the outcomes instrument to clinical change in the clients' perception of their health status over the course of therapy and support the use of health status as a measure of clinical outcome.  study design effect of clinical specialization was studied in a retrospective analysis of a commercial outcomes database.   objective to assess effectiveness of care as measured by changes in health status and efficiency as measured by visits, duration of treatment episode, and net revenue between patients treated by clinicians with and without orthopaedic clinical specialist certification (ocs).   background clinical specialization is becoming common in physical therapy, but there are no studies to support improved efficiency or effectiveness with advanced practitioner competencies.   methods and measures a total of 258 adults treated in practices participating in the focus on therapeutic outcomes process during 1996 comprised the data set. seven physical therapists with ocs treated 129 patients (clinical specialist group). these patients were matched to 129 patients not treated by physical therapists with ocs (comparison group) randomly chosen from the aggregate data set. all patients completed a standardized health status questionnaire at initial evaluation and discharge. standardized response means (srms) were calculated to measure change during treatment.   results therapists with ocs were more efficient than therapists without ocs, using fewer visits (9.1 +/- 6.7 vs 11.2 +/- 7.4) for less estimated cost ($949 +/- $736 vs $1238 +/- $1227) during the same treatment duration (35.9 +/- 48.3 vs 35.4 +/- 25.6 days) and performed fewer treatment procedures. overall, there was no difference in effectiveness as measured by change in health status, that is, unit of functional improvement per episode (0.89 +/- 1.0 srm for clinical specialists compared with 0.88 +/- 1.0 srm for comparison group). the ocs group had better value (unit of functional improvement per estimated dollar) and utilization (unit of functional improvement per visit) for the constructs of physical functioning (value: 1.31 +/- 2.7 vs 0.78 +/- 1.8; utilization: 1.25 +/- 2.2 vs 0.76 +/- 1.6) and role physical (value: 1.26 +/- 2.9 vs 0.44 +/- 3.5; utilization: 1.11 +/- 1.9 vs 0.51 +/- 2.3) (srms for ocs group vs comparison group, respectively).   conclusions our data support the conclusion that physical therapists with ocs are more efficient compared with clinicians without ocs. study limitations in design, small sample size, and low number of clinicians are discussed.
free market advocates consider consumer choice unambiguously welfare-enhancing, but critics argue that availability of certain products can be detrimental for society. contributing to this debate, we study the case of controversial skin whitening products sold widely in emerging markets. although positioned as empowering female consumers by providing more choice, these have been scrutinized for perpetuating women’s disempowerment by reinforcing sociocultural biases. to test these claims, we experimentally examine a possible relationship between women’s disempowerment and preference for skin whitening products in india, and find some evidence of a positive relationship. participants primed temporarily to feel more disempowered show greater preference for the stronger (and medically risky) products, but not for the milder ones. implications from our findings for corporate social responsibility and policy are discussed.  according to the ‘doing well by doing good’ proposition, firms have a corporate social responsibility to achieve some larger social goals, and can do so without a financial sacrifice. this paper empirically tests this proposition by examining in depth the case of ‘fair & lovely,’ a skin whitening cream, marketed by unilever in many countries in asia and africa, and, in particular, india. fair & lovely is indeed doing well; it is a profitable and fast growing brand. it is, however, not doing good, and we demonstrate its negative implications for public welfare. we conclude with thoughts on how to reconcile this divergence between private profits and public welfare.
backgroundchildren with cardiac defects need many hospitalizations and repetitive antibiotic therapies, with an increasing risk of colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria (mdrb) such as extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (esbl-e) post-operative infections with these bacteria in paediatric cardiac surgery are life threatening. this article aims to study the prevalence of esbl colonization among paediatric cardiac surgery patients, and to compare occurrence of post-operative infections with and without esbl colonization. we also aim to study the correlation between the onset of postoperative infection and other parameters such as age, length of stay and preoperative antibiotic therapy.methodsa retrospective cohort study included paediatric cardiac surgery patients in cheikh zaid hospital in rabat, morocco, between the 1st of january 2011 and 31 december 2014. a screening for esbl colonization was requested for children who had a risk factor (previous hospitalization and/or taking antibiotics) at admission. swabs were collected from three sites (throat, nose and anus). two groups were compared – patients colonized and not colonized with esbls. statistical analysis was performed using r software.resultsesbl colonization screening was performed in 111 patients. positive colonization was detected in 17 cases (15%). klebsiella pneumoniae (kp): 9 (53%) was the most frequently isolated species. among the 17 patients, 23.5% (4/17) developed a postoperative infection due to esbls versus only one patient without colonization (1%).there was a statically significant difference in terms of occurrence of postoperative infection between the two groups (p = 0.001). relative risk of developing a postoperative infection with positive colonization was 22 (95% ci, 8.37–58.5).conclusionsthe analysis of colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria and the prevention of nosocomial infections appear to be important challenges for paediatric cardiac surgery. systematic screening of esbl colonization for cardiac surgery could have a significant contribution, on one hand to guide prophylactic antibiotic therapy of patients, and on the other, to prevent spread of those infections.  introduction the incidence of multidrug resistant microorganisms worldwide is increasing. the aim of the study was to present institutional experience with the multidrug resistant microorganism colonization patterns observed in children with congenital heart diseases hospitalized in a hybrid pediatric cardiac surgery center. material and methods microbiological samples were routinely collected in all children admitted to our department. all microbiological samples were analyzed with regard to multidrug resistant microorganisms: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), gram-negative rods producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl), multidrug resistant gram-negative rods (mdr-gnrs), carbapenemase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (kpc), carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (crab) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (crpa). results in 30 (9%) swabs ‘alert’ pathogens from the above group of listed microorganisms were found. all positive swabs were isolated in 19 (16.1%) children. multidrug resistant pathogen colonization was statistically significantly more often observed in children admitted from other medical facilities than in children admitted from home (38% vs. 10%, p = 0.0089). in the group of children younger than 6 months ‘alert’ pathogen were more often observed than in older children (34.1% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001). conclusions preoperative multidrug resistant pathogen screening in children admitted and referred for congenital heart disease procedures may be of great importance since many of these patients are colonized with resistant bacteria. knowledge of the patient's microbiome is important in local epidemiological control along with tailoring the most effective preoperative prophylactic antibiotic for each patient. the impact of preoperative screening on postoperative infections and other complications requires further analysis.
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is a second messenger generated by stimulation of the phosphoinositide cycle, thought to release calcium from intracellular stores. we have mapped the distribution of 3h- inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor binding sites in rat brain by autoradiographic techniques. the cerebellum contains the highest level of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding sites in brain, which appear to be selectively localized to purkinje cells. moderate levels of binding sites are present in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, caudate, and substantia nigra. lesion studies indicate that binding in the hippocampus is restricted to intrinsic neuronal elements and in the nigra is found on terminals of the striatonigral projection. overall, the autoradiographic distribution of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors resembles the distribution of phorbol ester binding sites associated with protein kinase c. however, the inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate receptor has a more restricted distribution since it is not detectable in the spinal cord or olfactory bulb, regions with substantial levels of protein kinase c.  protein kinase c is a calcium- and phospholipid-stimulated enzyme present in high concentration in the brain. phorbol esters are potent tumor promoters that bind to specific receptors with high affinity. several lines of evidence indicate that the phorbol ester receptor is identical to protein kinase c. to determine the distribution of protein kinase c, we have localized phorbol ester receptors in the rat brain by autoradiography, using [3h]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3h]pdbu) and have performed a variety of lesions to assess the nature of the cellular elements possessing the binding sites. the [3h]pdbu binding sites in the rat brain are discretely localized and primarily associated with neurons. evidence is presented for localization to intrinsic neurons of the cortex and hippocampus, terminals of the striatonigral projection, a projection to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, and to dendrites of purkinje cells.
backgroundtyphoid fever is a systemic illness which in high-income countries mainly affects travellers. the incidence is particularly high on the indian subcontinent. travellers who visit friends and relatives (vfr) have been shown to have a different risk profile than others. we wished to identify main characteristics for travellers infected with s. typhi considering both clinical and laboratory findings in order to provide for faster and better diagnostics in the future. the outcome of treatment, especially concerning relapse, was evaluated as well.methodsretrospectively collected data from 19 adult cases of typhoid fever over a 5-year period at the department of infectious diseases, copenhagen university hospital, hvidovre denmark.resultsthe patients were young adults, presenting with symptoms within a month after travelling. 84% were returned from travelling in the indian subcontinent. 17 out of 19 patients were vfr-travellers. the main symptoms were fever (100%), gastrointestinal symptoms (84%), headache (58%) and dry cough (26%). laboratory findings showed elevated c-reactive protein (crp) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) in all cases and elevated alanine transaminase (alat) in 47% of cases. in primary cases 4 isolates were fully susceptible to ciprofloxacin, the remaining were intermediate susceptible. relapse occurred in 37% of the cases and only in cases where the patient was infected by a strain with intermediate susceptibility.conclusionsbetter pre-travel counselling should be given to vfr-travellers. the main symptoms and laboratory findings confirm previous findings. the relapse rate was unexpected high and could be correlated to ciprofloxacin-resistance.  we reviewed 232 consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary-care hospital under the care of an infectious diseases unit for management of febrile illness acquired overseas. a total of 53% presented to hospital within 1 week of return and 96% within 6 months. malaria was the most common diagnosis (27% of patients), followed by respiratory tract infection (24%), gastroenteritis (14%), dengue fever (8%), and bacterial pneumonia (6%). pretravel vaccination may have prevented a number of admissions, including influenza (n=11), typhoid fever (n=8) and hepatitis a (n=6). compared to those who had not traveled to africa, those who had were 6 times more likely to present with falciparum than nonfalciparum malaria. an itinerary that included asia was associated with a 13-fold increased risk of dengue, but a lower risk of malaria. palpable splenomegaly was associated with an 8-fold risk of malaria and hepatomegaly with a 4-fold risk of malaria. as a cause of fever, bacterial pneumonia was > or =5 times more likely in those who were aged >40 years.
our aim was to investigate whether guinea pig urothelium-derived bioactivities compatible with the existence of urothelium-derived inhibitory factor could be demonstrated by in vitro serial bioassay and whether purinergic p1 receptor agonists, nitric oxide, nitrite or prostaglandins might explain observed activities. in a cascade superfusion system, urothelium-denuded guinea pig ureters were used as bioassay tissues, recording their spontaneous rhythmic contractions in presence of scopolamine. urothelium-intact or -denuded guinea pig urinary bladders were used as donor tissues, stimulated by intermittent application of carbachol before or during the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor ng-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name), the adenosine/p1 nucleoside receptor antagonist 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (8-pst) or the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor diclofenac infused to bath donor and bioassay tissues. the spontaneous contractions of bioassay ureters were unaltered by application of carbachol 1–5 µm in the presence of scopolamine 5–30 µm. when carbachol was applied over the urothelium-denuded bladder, the assay ureter contraction rate was unaltered. introducing carbachol over the everted urothelium-intact bladder significantly inhibited the contraction frequency of the assay ureter, suggesting the transfer of an inhibitory activity from the bladder to the assay ureter. the transmissible inhibitory activity was not markedly antagonized by l-name, 8-pst or diclofenac, while l-name nearly abolished nitrite release from the urothelium-intact bladder preparations. we suggest that urothelium-derived inhibitory factor is a transmissible entity over a significant distance as demonstrated in this novel cascade superfusion assay and seems less likely to be nitric oxide, nitrite, an adenosine receptor agonist or subject to inhibition by administration of a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor.  1 the effect of adenosine 5′‐triphosphate (atp) on the free cytosolic ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]i) as measured with the fluorescent ca2+‐indicator fura‐2, and on force was investigated in the intact smooth muscle strips of the mouse urinary bladder. 2 atp elicited, when exogenously applied, a large increase of [ca2+]i with limited force development resulting in a marked ca2+‐force dissociation. 3 release of endogenous neurotransmitters by transmural electrical stimulation (tes) for 30 s induced a steady increase of [ca2+]i and a peak contraction, followed within 15 s by a relaxation. 4 in carbachol‐prestimulated preparations, atp elicited an initial rise of [ca2+]i followed by a return to the initial precontraction ca2+‐level. force in contrast presented a biphasic pattern, i.e. an initial contraction was followed by a sustained relaxation. 5 in the k+‐depolarized precontracted preparation, atp elicited a slight initial rise of [ca2+]i. the partial relaxation of the force during depolarization was not preceded by a transient contraction. 6 the atp‐induced relaxation of the k+‐prestimulated preparations was not inhibited by 8‐phenyltheophylline, a potent p1‐purinoceptor antagonist. 7 the order of potency for relaxation of the atp analogues was 2‐mesatp>atp>βγme‐atp, which is characteristic for p2y‐purinoceptors. 8 these results indicate that, besides its activating effect, atp also relaxes the mouse urinary bladder. it is suggested that the relaxant effect, mediated through p2y‐purinoceptors, is mainly responsible for the low contractile potency of atp in the bladder.
the mass shooting at sandy hook elementary school on december 14, 2012 catalyzed a year of active debate and legislation on gun control in the united states. social media hosted an active public discussion where people expressed their support and opposition to a variety of issues surrounding gun legislation. in this paper, we show how a content-based analysis of twitter data can provide insights and understanding into this debate. we estimate the relative support and opposition to gun control measures, along with a topic analysis of each camp by analyzing over 70 million gun-related tweets from 2013. we focus on spikes in conversation surrounding major events related to guns throughout the year. our general approach can be applied to other important public health and political issues to analyze the prevalence and nature of public opinion.  this paper describes our approach for the detecting stance in tweets task (semeval-2016 task 6). we utilized recent advances in short text categorization using deep learning to create word-level and character-level models. the choice between word-level and character-level models in each particular case was informed through validation performance. our final system is a combination of classifiers using word-level or character-level models. we also employed novel data augmentation techniques to expand and diversify our training dataset, thus making our system more robust. our system achieved a macro-average precision, recall and f1-scores of 0.67, 0.61 and 0.635 respectively.
in most large-scale distributed applications, publish/subscribe (p/s) systems allow a decoupling between senders and receivers to interact with publishers and subscribers. recently, in these areas, there has been increasing emphasis in managing end-to-end message delivery performance and message order-based consistency, which have been addressed in distributed collaborative applications. especially, a causally ordered delivery consistency is more useful for these applications in which a large number of processes request collaboratively and interactively. in p/s systems of wireless sensor networks (wsns), data fusion, the process of correlating individual sensor readings into high-level sensing results, depends on a causally ordered delivery. and gossip protocols based on p/s systems are becoming one of the promising solutions for addressing p/s scalability problems and very useful for the applications with a mixture of diverse message order consistencies. in this paper, we present two versions of causally ordered delivery protocols based on p/s systems using gossip protocols. the one is that only the predecessors immediately before the multicast message are disseminated from brokers to subscribers. and the other, specifically for p/s systems of wsns, is that the timestamps that represent the gossip round in which the immediate predecessors are generated are disseminated from brokers to subscribers. the features of these two versions might be highly scalable and suitable for the area of the applications requiring only the minimum causal information with flexible consistency.  with the sharp increase in heterogeneity and distribution of elements in wide-area networks, more flexible, efficient and autonomous approaches for management and information distribution are needed. this paper proposes a novel approach, based on gossip protocols and firefly synchronisation theory, for the management policy distribution and synchronisation over a number of nodes in an application level active network (alan). the work is presented in the context of the ist project android (active network distributed open infrastructure development), which is developing an autonomous policy-based management system for alan. the preliminary simulation results suggest that with the appropriately optimised parameters, the algorithms developed are scalable, can work effectively in a realistic random network, and allow the policy updates to be distributed efficiently throughout the active network with a lower latency than other similar types of gossip protocols.
this paper summarizes the idea of subarray-level parallelism (salp) in dram, which was published in isca 2012, and examines the work's significance and future potential. modern drams have multiple banks to serve multiple memory requests in parallel. however, when two requests go to the same bank, they have to be served serially, exacerbating the high latency of on-chip memory. adding more banks to the system to mitigate this problem incurs high system cost. our goal in this work is to achieve the benefits of increasing the number of banks with a low-cost approach. to this end, we propose three new mechanisms, salp-1, salp-2, and masa (multitude of activated subarrays), to reduce the serialization of different requests that go to the same bank. the key observation exploited by our mechanisms is that a modern dram bank is implemented as a collection of subarrays that operate largely independently while sharing few global peripheral structures.  our three proposed mechanisms mitigate the negative impact of bank serialization by overlapping different components of the bank access latencies of multiple requests that go to different subarrays within the same bank. salp-1 requires no changes to the existing dram structure, and needs to only reinterpret some of the existing dram timing parameters. salp-2 and masa require only modest changes (< 0.15% area overhead) to the dram peripheral structures, which are much less design constrained than the dram core. our evaluations show that salp-1, salp-2 and masa significantly improve performance for both single-core systems (7%/13%/17%) and multi-core systems (15%/16%/20%), averaged across a wide range of workloads. we also demonstrate that our mechanisms can be combined with application-aware memory request scheduling in multicore systems to further improve performance and fairness.  modern drams have multiple banks to serve multiple memory requests in parallel. however, when two requests go to the same bank, they have to be served serially, exacerbating the high latency of off-chip memory. adding more banks to the system to mitigate this problem incurs high system cost. our goal in this work is to achieve the benefits of increasing the number of banks with a low cost approach. to this end, we propose three new mechanisms that overlap the latencies of different requests that go to the same bank. the key observation exploited by our mechanisms is that a modern dram bank is implemented as a collection of subarrays that operate largely independently while sharing few global peripheral structures. our proposed mechanisms (salp-1, salp-2, and masa) mitigate the negative impact of bank serialization by overlapping different components of the bank access latencies of multiple requests that go to different subarrays within the same bank. salp-1 requires no changes to the existing dram structure and only needs reinterpretation of some dram timing parameters. salp-2 and masa require only modest changes (<;0.15% area overhead) to the dram peripheral structures, which are much less design constrained than the dram core. evaluations show that all our schemes significantly improve performance for both single-core systems and multi-core systems. our schemes also interact positively with application-aware memory request scheduling in multi-core systems.

the thoraces of males and flightless females of the geometrid winter moth nyssiodes lefuarius are described, documented in detail, and compared. morphological, functional, and evolutionary aspects of the female phenotype are discussed. the flightlessness of female n. lefuarius is linked not only with complex modifications of the skeletomuscular structure, especially elements of the flight apparatus, but also with greatly enlarged ovaries and a reduced gut. compared with other flightless female lepidopterans, females of n. lefuarius display a specific thoracic skeletomuscular configuration, which strongly suggests independent evolution, in agreement with the phylogenetic pattern. the evolutionary scenario of flight ability enhancement in lepidoptera is demonstrated using a combined phylogeny from recent studies based on molecular data. thoracic skeletomuscular characters are compiled and mapped, mainly using extensive information from the literature, but also including the new morphological data obtained from the male n. lefuarius. important changes in the thoracic character system are linked with the rise of coelolepida, heteroneura, and ditrysia. only minor changes take place in the character system in more advanced groups of lepidoptera. a highly unusual feature is the secondarily stiff wing type in some groups of ditrysia without the neopteran basal folding mechanism. the morphological background of the secondarily evolved “palaeopteran” condition is a complex of different character changes. major problems in the reconstruction of the phylogeny are a high degree of homoplasy and missing detailed data for several crucial taxa emerging close to the root of the order.  in order to facilitate the study of the evolution of female flightlessness among the geometrid subfamily ennominae (lepidoptera, geometridae), we carried out a phylogenetic analysis based on a morphological data matrix, and dna sequences. we used seven nuclear gene fragments, elongation factor 1alpha (ef-1alpha), wingless (wgl), isocitrate dehydrogenase (idh), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), ribosomal protein s5 (rps5) and segments d1 and d2 of the 28s rrna gene, and one mitochondrial gene fragment, cytochrome oxidase subunit i (coi). sampling included 55 species of ennominae covering all tribes with flightless females of the holarctic boreal zone, and some other geometrids used as outgroups. our results clearly confirmed that ennominae (including alsophila of the traditional subfamily alsophilinae) is a monophyletic group, as well as supported the previously established morphology-based division of ennominae into "ennomine" and "boarmiine" groups of genera. a number of taxonomic ambiguities were resolved but the monophyly of the traditionally recognised tribe bistonini, comprising a number of flightless species, remained ambiguous. bistonini is thus suggested to be subsumed to the tribe boarmiini in the broad sense. indeed, an analysis of timing of divergence suggested that boarmiini s. lat. rapidly diversified in the late oligocene/early miocene. within the ennominae, seven independent origins of female flightlessness were revealed facilitating phylogenetic comparative analyses to be performed in search of causes and consequences of this phenomenon. the present phylogenetic hypothesis supports the conclusions of the "adaptive story", a hypothesis of the sequence of evolutionary events leading to flightlessness, we have presented earlier (snäll et al., 2007). in particular, in the "boarmiine" group, the tribe boarmiini s. lat. clearly represents a group of geometrids in which female flightlessness has evolved more frequently than in any other tribes, suggesting that this clade has likely been predisposed to evolutionary events leading to the manifestation of female flightlessness. the ancestor of the wing-reduced ennominae has likely been a winged but slow flying forest moth feeding polyphagously on deciduous trees.
one of the most fundamental changes in cell morphology is the ingression of a plasma membrane furrow. the drosophila embryo undergoes several cycles of rapid furrow ingression during early development that culminate in the formation of an epithelial sheet. previous studies have demonstrated the requirement for intracellular trafficking pathways in furrow ingression; however, the pathways that link compartmental behaviors with cortical furrow ingression events are unclear. here, we show that rab8 has striking dynamic behaviors in vivo. as furrows ingress, cytoplasmic rab8 puncta are depleted and rab8 accumulates at the plasma membrane in a location that coincides with known regions of directed membrane addition. we additionally use crispr/cas9 technology to n-terminally tag rab8, which is then used to address endogenous localization and function. endogenous rab8 displays partial coincidence with rab11 and the golgi, and this colocalization is enriched during the fast phase of cellularization. when rab8 function is disrupted, furrow formation in the early embryo is completely abolished. we also demonstrate that rab8 behaviors require the function of the exocyst complex subunit sec5 as well as the recycling endosome protein rab11. active, gtp-locked rab8 is primarily associated with dynamic membrane compartments and the plasma membrane, whereas gdp-locked rab8 forms large cytoplasmic aggregates. these studies suggest a model in which active rab8 populations direct furrow ingression by guiding the targeted delivery of cytoplasmic membrane stores to the cell surface through interactions with the exocyst tethering complex. summary: during drosophila cellularization, the gtpase rab8 guides the targeting of cytoplasmic membrane stores to the cell surface through interactions with the exocyst complex.  cellularization of the drosophila embryo is a specialized form of cytokinesis that results in the formation of a polarized epithelium. the mechanisms of membrane growth during cytokinesis are largely unknown. it is also unclear whether membrane growth and polarization represent distinct processes that occur simultaneously or whether growth of the membrane is involved in the emergence of polarity. using a combination of surface labeling and particles tracking techniques, we monitored the dynamics of marked membrane regions during cellularization. we find that the major source of membrane is intracellular, rather than in the form of a plasma membrane reservoir. depolymerization of microtubules inhibits the export of a newly synthesized transmembrane protein from the golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane and simultaneously blocks membrane growth. membrane insertion occurs in a defined sequence at specific sites, first apical, then apical–lateral. diffusion of the membrane appears insufficient to compete with the massive local insertion of new membrane. we thus identify a tightly regulated scheme of polarized membrane insertion during cellularization. we propose that such a mechanism could participate in the progressive emergence of apical–basal polarity.
abstract background: b-natriuretic peptide (bnp) and aminoterminal probnp (nt-probnp) are clinically useful for the diagnosis of decompensated heart failure and for prognosis in heart failure and acute coronary syndromes. clinical use of these biomarkers in critically ill patients being treated in intensive care is not well established. methods: this is a narrative review of evidence identified searching medline with the strategy [(bnp or nt-probnp) and (critical illness and intensive care)]. seven primary reports and two narrative reviews were retrieved. for completeness, literature from each of the following searches was reviewed: [(bnp or nt-probnp) and (critical illness)] and [(bnp or nt-probnp) and (intensive care)]. results: primary literature used bnp and nt-probnp for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring. for diagnosis of acute lung injury in unselected intensive care patients and for diagnosis of heart failure in trauma patients, the biomarkers had low sensitivity and are of modest use. bnp and nt-probnp were found to have a significant ability to prognosticate adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. a single paper examined the use of bnp as a non-invasive replacement for pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, finding little value. the impact of renal insufficiency on the markers was noted as a confounder in most studies. in the secondary searches, some preliminary data suggested a possible role for the natriuretic peptides in exclusion of a cardiac cause for certain conditions among intensive care unit (icu) patients. however, the general findings were that the performance of bnp and nt-probnp is unimpressive among icu patients. conclusions: currently, utilization of bnp and nt-probnp does not appear to provide much useful information or have a substantial role in the care of critically ill patients in intensive care. clin chem lab med 2008;46:1524–32.  objective:the role of plasma b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) in critically ill patients with acute pulmonary edema is controversial. we postulated that a low bnp level would exclude cardiac dysfunction as the principal cause of pulmonary edema and therefore help in the diagnosis of acute lung injury. design:a retrospective derivation cohort was followed by a prospective validation cohort of consecutive patients with acute pulmonary edema admitted to three intensive care units. bnp was measured within 24 hrs from onset. critical care experts blinded to bnp results integrated clinical data with the course of disease and response to therapy and served as the reference standard. setting:three intensive care units at the tertiary center. patients:consecutive critically ill patients with acute pulmonary edema. interventions:none. measurements and main results:in a derivation cohort of 84 patients, a bnp threshold of ≤250 pg/ml had a specificity of 87% and sensitivity of 48% for the diagnosis of acute lung injury. high specificity of bnp (90%, likelihood ratio of 3.9) was confirmed in a validation cohort of 120 consecutive patients, 52 (43%) of whom had acute lung injury. notably, 32% of patients with acute lung injury had concomitant cardiac dysfunction. the median time from the onset of pulmonary edema to bnp testing was 3 hrs. the accuracy of bnp (area under receiver operator curve, 0.71) was comparable with pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (area under receiver operator curve, 0.66) and superior to ejection fraction (area under receiver operator curve, 0.60) in subgroups of patients in whom these tests were performed. the accuracy of bnp improved when patients with renal insufficiency were excluded (area under receiver operator curve, 0.82). conclusion:when measured early after the onset of acute pulmonary edema, a bnp level of <250 pg/ml supports the diagnosis of acute lung injury. the high rate of cardiac and renal dysfunction in critically ill patients limits the discriminative role of bnp. no level of bnp could completely exclude cardiac dysfunction.
in rheumatoid arthritis (ra), the patient global assessment (pga) has been strongly associated with pain severity, but less often with other measures, including disease activity measures. we tested whether ra activity and psychological measures had direct associations with the pga or indirect associations that were mediated by pain. we also tested whether the correlates of the pga differed with the degree of ra activity.  a structure for representation of patient outcome is presented, together with a method for outcome measurement and validation of the technique in rheumatoid arthritis. the paradigm represents outcome by five separate dimensions: death, discomfort, disability, drug (therapeutic) toxicity, and dollar cost. each dimension represents an outcome directly related to patient welfare. quantitation of these outcome dimensions may be performed at interview or by patient questionnaire. with standardized, validated questions, similar scores are achieved by both methods. the questionnaire technique is preferred since it is inexpensive and does not require interobserver validation. these techniques appear extremely useful for evaluation of long term outcome of patients with rheumatic diseases.
backgroundbrazil has seen a great decline in malaria and the country is moving towards elimination. however, for eventual elimination, the control program needs efficient tools in order to monitor malaria exposure and transmission. in this study, we aimed to evaluate whether seroprevalence to the circumsporozoite protein (csp) is a good tool for monitoring the exposure to and/or evaluating the burden and distribution of plasmodium species in the brazilian amazon.methodscross-sectional surveys were conducted in a rural area of porto velho, rondônia state. parasite infection was detected by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction. antibodies to the sporozoite csp repeats of plasmodium vivax, p. falciparum, and p. malariae (pvcs, pfcs, and pmcs) were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. human leukocyte antigen (hla)-drb1 and dqb1 genes were typed using luminex® xmap® technology.resultsthe prevalence of immunoglobulin g against p. vivax csp peptide (62%) was higher than p. falciparum (49%) and p. malariae (46%) csp peptide. most of the studied individuals had antibodies to at least one of the three peptides (72%), 34% had antibodies to all three peptides and 28% were non-responders. although the majority of the population was not infected at the time of the survey, 74.3% of parasite-negative individuals had antibodies to at least one of the csps. importantly, among individuals carrying the haplotypes drb1*04~dqb1*03, there was a significantly higher frequency of pfcs responders, and drb1*16~dqb1*03 haplotype for pvcs and pfcs responders. in contrast, hla-drb1*01 and hla-dqb1*05 allelic groups were associated with a lack of antibodies to p. vivax and p. falciparum csp repeats, and the haplotype drb1*01~dqb1*05 was also associated with non-responders, including non-responders to p. malariae.conclusionsour results show that in low transmission settings, naturally acquired antibody responses against the csp repeats of p. vivax, p. falciparum, and p. malariae in a single cross-sectional study may not represent a valuable marker for monitoring recent malaria exposure, especially in an area with a high prevalence of p. vivax. furthermore, hla class ii molecules play an important role in antibody response and require further study with a larger sample size. it will be of interest to consider hla analysis when using serosurveillance to monitor malaria exposure among genetically diverse populations.  the persistence of malarial antibodies was evaluated in subjects living in a rural community (in minas gerais state, brazil) briefly exposed to a plasmodium vivax malaria outbreak outside of the area in which malaria was endemic. transmission was interrupted by treatment of all patients and their relatives and/or neighbors, although the latter had neither symptoms nor blood parasites. antibodies to p. vivax antigens (recombinant proteins from sporozoites [rpvcs] and from blood stages [rpv200]) were measured in parallel by elisa with sera collected at two time points after transmission. anti-rpvcs igg antibodies were positive in approximately 40% and 20% of the subjects 8 months and 7 years after exposure, respectively. anti-rpv200 igg was first detected in 61% of the subjects who had had malarial symptoms and remained positive in 47% after 7 years. among the prophylactically treated group, anti-rpv200 igg was detected in only 28% after 8 months. the levels of both antibodies decreased with time in all positive subjects.
the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of image resolution on (a) relative and absolute values of caudate glucose consumption (rcmrgic) determined by positron emission tomography (pet), and (b) the detection of significant differences in these metabolic values between groups of subjects. for this purpose, raw data of cerebral accumulation of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg) obtained in 11 normal subjects and in nine patients with unilateral thalamic infarction were reconstructed using filtered backprojection with four different cut-off frequencies (cfs), yielding images with a transaxial resolution of 5.7, 7.1, 8.9 and 11 mm (full-width at half-maximum; fwhm). absolute values of caudate rcmrgic decreased significantly by more than 30% over the range of image resolutions studied. bilateral ratios of caudate rcmrgic were insensitive to variations in image resolution. levels of significance assessing the differences in mean metabolic values between patients and controls were all below 0.01. they were, however, slightly better at image resolutions of 7.1 and 8.9 mm than at a resolution of 5.7 mm. these data indicate (a) that relative values of rcmrgic are better suited to compare quantitative results from different pet cameras than are absolute values, and (b) that the cf used for the filtered back-projection exerts a small but not negligible influence on levels of significance assessing differences in metabolic values between groups of subjects.  the aim of this study was to analyze the influence of variations in the size of regions of interest (rois) on values of caudate glucose consumption [regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rcmrglc)] assessed by pet. in addition, we tried to establish the influence of roi size on levels of significance assessing differences in mean caudate glucose consumption between two groups of subjects. for this purpose, rcmrglc was measured using [18f]fluorodeoxyglucose and the pc-4096 pet camera with an in-plane resolution of 7.1 mm in 12 normal subjects and 12 subjects with early huntington disease. caudate rcmrglc was histographically determined using 10 different roi widths ranging from 2 mm, corresponding to the peak value of caudate rcmrglc, to 20 mm. the increase in roi width from 2 to 20 mm led to a significant decrease of caudate rcmrglc by ∼66% in the normal subjects and in the patients. the student t value assessing the differences in mean caudate rcmrglc between the two groups decreased gradually from 5.61 for an roi width of 2 mm to 3.78 for an roi width of 20 mm. this corresponds to a worsening of the level of significance from 10–5 to 10–3, i.e., by a factor of 100. these data show that (given the resolution of presently used pet cameras) the selection of peak values of caudate rcmrglc is the best way to discriminate between groups of subjects supposed to differ with respect to caudate rcmrglc.
we investigate the properties of multifractal products of geometric gaussian processes with possible long-range dependence and geometric ornstein–uhlenbeck processes driven by levy motion and their finite and infinite superpositions. we present the general conditions for the lq convergence of cumulative processes to the limiting processes and investigate their qth order moments and renyi functions, which are non-linear, hence displaying the multifractality of the processes as constructed. we also establish the corresponding scenarios for the limiting processes, such as log-normal, log-gamma, log-tempered stable or log-normal tempered stable scenarios.  in various fields, such as teletraffic and economics, measured time series have been reported to adhere to multifractal scaling. classical cascading measures possess multifractal scaling, but their increments form a nonstationary process. to overcome this problem, we introduce a construction of random multifractal measures based on iterative multiplication of stationary stochastic processes, a special form of t-martingales. we study the ℒ2-convergence, nondegeneracy, and continuity of the limit process. establishing a power law for its moments, we obtain a formula for the multifractal spectrum and hint at how to prove the full formalism.
mycophenolic acid (mpa) is the active immunosuppressive metabolite of the anti-organ rejection drug mycophenolate mofetil (mmf) and is implicated in the gastrointestinal toxicity associated with mmf therapy. intestinal udp-glucuronosyltransferases (ugt) have been proposed to provide intrinsic resistance against mmf-induced gastrointestinal toxicity by converting mpa to the inactive mpa 7-o-glucuronide. using an optimized intestinal microsome preparation method that stabilized the intestinal mpa ugt activity, the mpa ugt activity of male sprague-dawley rat intestinal microsomes was characterized. a longitudinal gradient similar to that described for other phenolic compounds was observed, with the activity decreasing from the duodenum to the distal small intestine and colon. the catalytic efficiency of mpa glucuronidation decreased from the proximal to distal intestine as a result of decreasing vmax and increasing km. the finding that homozygous gunn rats lack detectable intestinal mpa ugt activity indicates exclusive roles of ugt1a1, ugt1a6, and/or ugt1a7. quantitative immunoblotting revealed a parallel between the mpa ugt activity and the content of ugt1a7-like immunoreactivity (18.7 and 7.3 μg/mg for duodenum and colon, respectively). in contrast, the lesser mpa-metabolizing ugt, ugt1a1 and ugt1a6, were lower in abundance (1.6–2.1 and 1.7–2.9 μg/mg, respectively), and their patterns of longitudinal distribution were distinct from the mpa ugt activity. these data suggest a dominant role of a ugt1a7-like enzyme, presumably ugt1a7 itself, in the catalysis of rat intestinal mpa glucuronidation. studies are ongoing to investigate the relationship between intestinal ugt1a enzymes and susceptibility to mmf-induced gastrointestinal toxicity.  gastrointestinal surgery was used in order to determine the role of normal food components, bile and pancreatic secretion in the control of mucosal glucuronide synthesis. furthermore a few rats were treated either intragastrically or intraperitoneally with phenobarbitone. both the rate of o-aminophenyl glucuronide synthesis in slices and the activity of udp glucuronyltransferase in mucosal extracts were studied. in partial jejunectomies no changes were found in glucuronide synthesis when compared with the controls, but in jejunal thiry-vella loops and in duodenal and jejunal blind sacs the glucuronide synthesis rate was significantly lower. in gastro-jejunostomized rats a transient increase in the glucuronide synthesis rate was noted in the gastro-jejunostomy area. phenobarbitone administration did not increase the small intestinal udp glucuronyltransferase activity when administered either intraperitoneally or intragastrically. the results indicate that the chyme factors are of importance in the control of glucuronide synthesis in the small intestine of the rat, but that phenobarbitone has no effect.
during the dna damage response (ddr), ubiquitination plays an important role in the recruitment and regulation of repair proteins. however, little is known about elimination of the ubiquitination signal after repair is completed. here we show that the ubiquitin-specific protease 5 (usp5), a deubiquitinating enzyme, is involved in the elimination of the ubiquitin signal from damaged sites and is required for efficient dna double-strand break (dsb) repair. depletion of usp5 sensitizes cells to dna damaging agents, produces dsbs, causes delayed disappearance of γh2ax foci after bleocin treatment, and influences dsb repair efficiency in the homologous recombination pathway but not in the non-homologous end joining pathway. usp5 co-localizes to dsbs induced by laser micro-irradiation in a rad18-dependent manner. importantly, polyubiquitin chains at sites of dna damage remained for longer periods in usp5-depleted cells. our results show that disassembly of polyubiquitin chains by usp5 at sites of damage is important for efficient dsb repair.  mutations in brca1 are associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. brca1 participates in the dna damage response and acts as a ubiquitin ligase. however, its regulation remains poorly understood. here we report that brca1 is modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo) in response to genotoxic stress, and co-localizes at sites of dna damage with sumo1, sumo2/3 and the sumo-conjugating enzyme ubc9. pias sumo e3 ligases co-localize with and modulate sumo modification of brca1, and are required for brca1 ubiquitin ligase activity in cells. in vitro sumo modification of the brca1/bard1 heterodimer greatly increases its ligase activity, identifying it as a sumo-regulated ubiquitin ligase (srubl). further, pias sumo ligases are required for complete accumulation of double-stranded dna (dsdna) damage-repair proteins subsequent to rnf8 accrual, and for proficient double-strand break repair. these data demonstrate that the sumoylation pathway plays a significant role in mammalian dna damage response.
providing learning materials and support services that are adapted to the needs of individuals has the potential to enable learners to obtain maximal benefit from university level studies. this paper describes eu4all project which has been exploring how to present customized learning materials and services for people with disabilities. a number of the technical components of the eu4all framework are described. this is followed with a brief description of prototype implementations. this is then followed by a discussion of a number of research directions that may enhance the adaptability, usability and accessibility of information and support systems can be used and consumed by a diverse user population.  uned uses dotlrn learning management system (lms) in two different scopes i) exploitation and ii) research due to the integration capabilities, adaptivity, reusability and accessibility support. the paper introduces the main features of openacs/dotlrn architecture and provides an historical overview of the usage of dotlrn in innova (exploitation) and adenu (research) groups. it details the reasons why openacs/dotlrn was chosen in both groups and presents a comparison among dotlrn and other lms, with special emphasis on moodle (the most commonly used open source lms) to show their pros and cons. the paper describes how it is being used in each group and what contributions have been done to the community so far.
backgroundthe ability to estimate durations in the seconds-to-minutes range - interval timing - is essential for survival, adaptation and its impairment leads to severe cognitive and/or motor dysfunctions. the response rate near a memorized duration has a gaussian shape centered on the to-be-timed interval (criterion time). the width of the gaussian-like distribution of responses increases linearly with the criterion time, i.e., interval timing obeys the scalar property.resultswe presented analytical and numerical results based on the striatal beat frequency (sbf) model showing that parameter variability (noise) mimics behavioral data. a key functional block of the sbf model is the set of oscillators that provide the time base for the entire timing network. the implementation of the oscillators block as simplified phase (cosine) oscillators has the additional advantage that is analytically tractable. we also checked numerically that the scalar property emerges in the presence of memory variability by using biophysically realistic morris-lecar oscillators. first, we predicted analytically and tested numerically that in a noise-free sbf model the output function could be approximated by a gaussian. however, in a noise-free sbf model the width of the gaussian envelope is independent of the criterion time, which violates the scalar property. we showed analytically and verified numerically that small fluctuations of the memorized criterion time leads to scalar property of interval timing.conclusionsnoise is ubiquitous in the form of small fluctuations of intrinsic frequencies of the neural oscillators, the errors in recording/retrieving stored information related to criterion time, fluctuation in neurotransmitters’ concentration, etc. our model suggests that the biological noise plays an essential functional role in the sbf interval timing.  humans and other animals demonstrate the ability to perceive and respond to temporally relevant information with characteristic behavioral properties. for example, the response time distributions in peak-interval timing tasks are well described by gaussian functions, and superimpose when scaled by the criterion duration. this superimposition has been referred to as the scalar property and results from the fact that the standard deviation of a temporal estimate is proportional to the duration being timed. various psychological models have been proposed to account for such responding. these models vary in their success in predicting the temporal control of behavior as well as in the neurobiological feasibility of the mechanisms they postulate. a review of the major interval timing models reveals that no current model is successful on both counts. the neurobiological properties of the basal ganglia, an area known to be necessary for interval timing and motor control, suggests that this set of structures act as a coincidence detector of cortical and thalamic input. the hypothesized functioning of the basal ganglia is similar to the mechanisms proposed in the beat frequency timing model [r.c. miall, neural computation 1 (1989) 359-371], leading to a reevaluation of its capabilities in terms of behavioral prediction. by implementing a probabilistic firing rule, a dynamic response threshold, and adding variance to a number of its components, simulations of the striatal beat frequency model were able to produce output that is functionally equivalent to the expected behavioral response form of peak-interval timing procedures.
background a vaccine for chlamydia trachomatis is of urgent medical need. we explored bioinformatic approaches to generate an immunogen against c. trachomatis that would induce cross-serovar t-cell responses as (i) cd4+ t cells have been shown in animal models and human studies to be important in chlamydial protection and (ii) antibody responses may be restrictive and serovar specific. methods a consensus antigen based on over 1,500 major outer membrane protein (momp) sequences provided high epitope coverage against the most prevalent c. trachomatis strains in silico. having designed the t-cell immunogen, we assessed it for immunogenicity in prime-boost regimens. this consensus momp transgene was delivered using plasmid dna, human adenovirus 5 (huad5) or modified vaccinia ankara (mva) vectors with or without mf59® adjuvanted recombinant momp protein. results different regimens induced distinct immune profiles. the dna-huad5-mva-protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal momp-specific antibodies. this regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal c. trachomatis serovar d infection in both balb/c and b6c3f1 mouse strains. this enhanced clearance was shown to be cd4+ t-cell dependent. future studies will need to confirm the specificity and precise mechanisms of protection. conclusion a c. trachomatis vaccine needs to induce a robust cellular response with broad cross-serovar coverage and a heterologous prime-boost regimen may be an approach to achieve this.  the majority of vaccine candidates in clinical development are highly purified proteins and peptides relying on adjuvants to enhance and/or direct immune responses. despite the acknowledged need for novel adjuvants, there are still very few adjuvants in licensed human vaccines. a vast number of adjuvants have been tested pre-clinically using different experimental conditions, rendering it impossible to directly compare their activity. we performed a head-to-head comparison of five different adjuvants alum, mf59®, gla-se, ic31® and caf01 in mice and combined these with antigens from m. tuberculosis, influenza, and chlamydia to test immune-profiles and efficacy in infection models using standardized protocols. regardless of antigen, each adjuvant had a unique immunological signature suggesting that the adjuvants have potential for different disease targets. alum increased antibody titers; mf59® induced strong antibody and il-5 responses; gla-se induced antibodies and th1; caf01 showed a mixed th1/th17 profile and ic31® induced strong th1 responses. mf59® and gla-se were strong inducers of influenza hi titers while caf01, gla-se and ic31® enhanced protection to tb and chlamydia. importantly, this is the first extensive attempt to categorize clinical-grade adjuvants based on their immune profiles and protective efficacy to inform a rational development of next generation vaccines for human use.
although physical activity (pa) has been inversely associated with depressive symptoms, it is not clear whether regular pa and television watching are associated with clinical depression risk. the authors conducted a prospective analysis involving 49,821 us women from the nurses' health study who were free from depressive symptoms at baseline (1996). information on pa was obtained from validated questionnaires completed in 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000; analyses were conducted using the cumulative average of pa (minutes/day) with a 2-year latency period applied. participants were asked about television-watching habits in 1992. cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for multiple risk factors were used to estimate relative risks of clinical depression (self-reported physician-diagnosed depression or use of antidepressants). during 10 years of follow-up (1996-2006), 6,505 incident cases of depression were documented. higher levels of pa were associated with lower depression risk. the multivariate relative risk comparing the highest level of pa (≥ 90 minutes/day) with the lowest (<10 minutes/day) was 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.70, 0.92; p(trend) < 0.001). in contrast, the risk of depression increased with increasing television-watching time. the multivariate relative risk comparing women who spent 21 hours/week or more watching television with those who spent 0-1 hour/week was 1.13 (95% confidence interval: 1.00, 1.27; p(trend) = 0.01). analyses simultaneously considering pa and television watching suggested that both contributed independently to depression risk.  background: a growing body of evidence suggests that physical activity might reduce the risk of depressive symptoms, but there are limited data on black women.purpose: the objective was to evaluate the association between leisure time physical activity and depressive symptoms in u.s. black women.methods: participants included 35,224 women ages 21 to 69 from the blackwomen’s health study, a follow-up study of african american women in which data are collected biennially by mail questionnaire.women answered questions on past and current exercise levels at baseline (1995) and follow-up (1997). the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (ces-d) was used to measure depressive symptoms in 1999. women who reported a diagnosis of depression before 1999 were excluded. we used multivariate logistic regression models to compute odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for physical activity in relation to depressive symptoms (ces-d score <= 16) with control for potential confounders.results: adult vigorous physical activity was inversely associated with depressive symptoms. women who reported vigorous exercise both in high school (<= 5 hr per week) and adulthood (<= 2 hr per week) had the lowest odds of depressive symptoms (or = 0.76, 95% ci = 0.71−0.82) relative to never active women; the or was 0.90 for women who were active in high school but not adulthood (95% ci = 0.85-0.96) and 0.83 for women who were inactive in high school but became active in adulthood (95% ci = 0.77-0.91). although walking for exercise was not associated with risk of depressive symptoms overall, there was evidence of a weak inverse relation among obese women (body mass index <= 30).conclusions: leisure time vigorous physical activity was associated with a reduced odds of depressive symptoms in u.s. black women.
objective: to evaluate age of the patient at the time of surgery and estimated postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1%) as predictors of long-term survival following complete resection of non-small cell lung carcinoma (nsclc). methods: retrospective, observational study. records of patients operated on for nsclc between january 1994 and december 1997 were reviewed. one hundred and ninety three patients who underwent complete pathological resection and survived surgery were included for study. patients were divided in groups depending on age at the time of surgery and predicted postoperative fev1% calculated according to the number of resected segments. values of the 75th percentile of age (70.29 years) and 50th percentile of predicted fev1% (52.9) were the cut-points selected for group division. to increase the power of the analysis pathological staging was also converted in a binary variable and resumed to localized (stage i) or extended (stage ii±iiib). univariate analysis of the effect of each variable on survival was assessed by kaplan±meier method and log-rank test. relationship between variables was investigated using 2 £ 2 tables and fisher's exact test. unrelated variables (extension, age and low estimated postoperative fev1%) entered in a cox-regression model to predict long-term survival following resection. results: pathological stage (p , 0:0001), age (p  0:01) and low estimated postoperative fev1% (p  0:0007) showed independent value to predict the outcome. conclusion: advanced age and low predicted postoperative fev1% play an adverse effect on survival of completely resected nsclc. q 2000 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.  for men participating in the multiple risk factor intervention trial, the authors evaluated the relation between the baseline forced expiratory volume in one second and lung cancer mortality among smokers between the third and tenth years of follow-up (1973-1974 to 1984). this measure of ventilatory function was a powerful predictor of lung cancer deaths, with rates that increased from 3.02 per 1,000 person-years in the lowest quintile of forced expiratory volume to 0.43 in the highest quintile. this relation was not weakened by adjustments for smoking dose, including number of cigarettes smoked per day, tar and nicotine content, duration of smoking, or age at onset of smoking. nor was forced expiratory volume related to time between its determination and lung cancer death. if these observations can be verified in other studies, the forced expiratory volume in one second may identify smokers at very high risk of lung cancer and, hence, in need of more aggressive preventive approaches.
abstract the basal ganglia have traditionally been associated with motor control functions and this view has prevailed since the late nineteenth century. recent experimental studies suggest that this neuroanatomical system is also critically involved in motor learning. in the present study, motor learning/transfer capabilities were compared between patients with parkinson’s disease and a group of normal elderly people. subjects practiced a bimanual coordination task that required continuous flexion-extension movements in the transverse plane with a 90° phase offset between the forearms. during acquisition, augmented visual feedback of the relative motions was provided in real time. the findings revealed improvements in the bimanual coordination pattern across practice in both groups when the augmented concurrent feedback was present. however, when transferred to performance conditions in which the augmented information was withheld, performance deteriorated (relative to the augmented condition) and this effect was more prevalent in the parkinson patients. more specifically, no improvement in interlimb coordination was observed under nonaugmented feedback conditions across practice. instead, a drift toward the preferred in-phase and anti-phase coordination patterns was evident. the present findings suggest that parkinson patients can improve their performance on a new motor task, but they remain strongly dependent on augmented visual information to guide these newly acquired movements. the apparent adoption of a closed-loop control mode is accompanied with decreases in movement speed in order to use the feedback to ensure accuracy. when the augmented feedback is withheld and the movement pattern is to be controlled by means of intrinsic information feedback sources, performance is severely hampered. the findings are hypothesized to indicate that learning/transfer is affected in parkinson patients who apparently prefer some constancy in the environmental contingencies under which practice takes place. the present findings are consistent with the notion that the basal ganglia form a critical neuroanatomical substrate for motor learning.  normal voluntary movements are considered to be of two kinds, or to involve two components, (i) a ballistic or "open-loop" type, which are preprogrammed and executed without reference to current sensory information and (ii) a corrective or "closed-loop" type, whose course or termination are regulated by such information. in a previous paper it was suggested that parkinsonism disrupted the first kind of movement, but intention tremor did not. in the present paper three experiments designed to test this hypothesis are described. subjects were tested on an acquisition-tracking task using an oscilloscope display and joystick control, and measurements were made of the duration, velocity and error of their initial movements to acquire the target. parkinsonian movements were found to be considerably different from normal in that (a) most movements by this group lasted longer than the reaction time for their initiation, as if including some secondary correction in their execution, (b) the rate of movement was not varied for different amplitudes (so keeping the duration fairly constant) as in normal subjects, but rather movements of all amplitudes were made at a constant slow rate, so that duration increased markedly with the larger steps, (c) error increased disproportionately as the velocity of movement increased; in particular any movements completed in one reaction time or less tended to be wildly inaccurate, (d) removing either the target or the response marker from the screen at the beginning of a movement had a significant effect, making it shorter in duration and smaller in amplitude than those usually produced with both markers visible all the time. parkinsonian subjects showed no improvement in performance with repeated attempts at one movement over a whole sequence, so their deficit appears to be stable even after practice on a known fixed task. these results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that parkinsonism interferes with the generation of accurate ballistic action which are characteristic of normal skilled movement. tremor subjects in general resembled normal control subjects in their initial acquistion movements, but their accuracy was less with the larger steps.
background ccl18 has been shown to have an important role in the progression of gastric and breast cancers. however, the prognostic value of ccl18 in colorectal cancer (crc) remains unknown.   materials and methods we used immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of ccl18 in crc patients. we applied both univariate and multivariate analysis to evaluate the prognostic value of ccl18 on crc patients' survival. we used double staining to investigate the relationship between ccl18 and macrophages.   results a total 371 crc patient samples were enrolled in immunohistochemical analysis. according to our criteria, 118 samples (31.8%) showed a high ccl18 expression level. clinicopathologic analysis revealed an association between the expression level of ccl18 and the preoperative carcino embryonic antigen level (p = 0.001), and the preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level (p = 0.003). survival analysis and multivariate analysis revealed that ccl18 was an independent favorable prognostic factor in patients with crc (p = 0.033). double staining implied that ccl18 was expressed by macrophages.   conclusions a high ccl18 level might be an independent biomarker for predicting better survival of patients with crc.  cell-mediated immunity plays a crucial role in the control of many infectious diseases, necessitating the need for adjuvants that can augment cellular immune responses elicited by vaccines. it is well established that protection against one such disease, malaria, requires strong cd8+ t cell responses targeted against the liver stages of the causative agent, plasmodium spp. in this report we show that the dendritic cell-specific chemokine, dendritic cell-derived cc chemokine 1 (dc-ck1), which is produced in humans and acts on naive lymphocytes, can enhance ag-specific cd8+ t cell responses when coadministered with either irradiated plasmodium yoelii sporozoites or a recombinant adenovirus expressing the p. yoelii circumsporozoite protein in mice. we further show that these enhanced t cell responses result in increased protection to malaria in immunized mice challenged with live p. yoelii sporozoites, revealing an adjuvant activity for dc-ck1. dc-ck1 appears to act preferentially on naive mouse lymphocytes, and its adjuvant effect requires il-12, but not ifn-γ or cd40. overall, our results show for the first time an in vivo role for dc-ck1 in the establishment of primary t cell responses and indicate the potential of this chemokine as an adjuvant for vaccines against malaria as well as other diseases in which cellular immune responses are important.
rehabilitation services are less-studied aspects of the management following total knee arthroplasty (tka) despite long-term suboptimal physical functioning and chronic deficits in muscle function. this paper describes the preliminary findings of a six-week (12 session) eccentrically-biased rehabilitation program targeted at deficits in physical function and muscle function, initiated one month following surgery. a quasiexperimental, one group, pretest-posttest study with thirteen individuals (6 female, 7 male; mean age 57 ± 7 years) examined the effectiveness of an eccentrically-biased rehabilitation program. the program resulted in improvements in the primary physical function endpoints (sf-36 physical component summary and the six-minute walk test) with increases of 59% and 47%, respectively. muscle function endpoints (knee extension strength and power) also increased 107% and 93%, respectively. eccentrically-biased exercise used as an addition to rehabilitation may help amplify and accelerate physical function following tka surgery.  background context in the last decade, the number of patients undergoing surgical treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis (lss), particularly instrumented fusions, has significantly increased. the surgical procedures for lss represent a significant cost to the health-care system and are a priority focus for most governments, insurers, hospital administrators, and spine care physicians.   purpose the purpose of this study was to directly compare the relative improvement in self-reported quality of life after surgical intervention for matched groups of patients with primary hip or knee osteoarthritis (h-oa/k-oa) and focal lumbar spinal stenosis (flss).   study design/setting observational cohort study of prospectively collected outcomes.   patient sample patients, following elective primary one- to two-level spinal decompression (n=90) with (n=28/90) or without fusion for flss, were compared with a matched (age, sex, and time of surgery) cohort of patients who had undergone elective total hip (n=90) or total knee (n=90) arthroplasty (total joint arthroplasty [tja]) for primary osteoarthritis.   outcome measures medical outcomes study short form-36 (sf-36).   methods patents were obtained for prospective outcomes databases (tja and spine). inclusion and exclusion criteria were independently applied, and matching was performed in a blinded fashion. the primary outcome measure was the relative change between preoperative and 2-year postoperative sf-36 questionnaires. data were analyzed with the t test and repeated measures analysis of variance (anova).   results the three groups (flss/h-oa/k-oa) were equally matched with respect to mean age (64/63/65 years), sex (female/male, 51/39 for all groups), body mass index (bmi) (27/24/27), and american society of anesthesiologists (asa) physical status (2/2/2). comparison of preoperative sf-36 physical component summary (pcs) scores and mental component summary (mcs) scores between groups showed no statistical difference (pcs: flss=32.0, h-oa=30.2, k-oa=31.3 [p=.32, anova]/mcs: flss=43.5, h-oa=45.0, k-oa=46.2 [p=.25, anova]). postoperatively, pcs improved significantly for all groups (1 year-pcs: flss=39.6, h-oa=44.5, k-oa=38.5 [p<.0001 for all groups]; 2 years-pcs: flss=38.6, h-oa=43.2, k-oa=37.1 [p<.0001 for all groups]). at both 1- and 2-year follow-ups, the pcs improvement between groups was greater for the h-oa group compared with the flss (p=.0037, p=.0073) and k-oa (p=.00016, p=.00053) groups. at the 1-year follow-up, mcs did not significantly increase for any group; however, 2 years postoperatively, mcs improved significantly for the flss and h-oa groups (2 years-mcs: flss=50.3, h-oa=50.9, k-oa=44.8 [p=.00021, p=.00079, p=.35]). at the 1-year follow-up, there was no statistical difference in mcs improvement between groups (p=.45, anova). two years postoperatively, the mcs for both the flss and h-oa groups was significantly greater than that for the k-oa group (p=.0014, p=.00055).   conclusions the results of this study show that surgical intervention for flss can obtain and maintain improvement in self-reported quality of life comparable to that of total hip and knee arthroplasty. this study provides data to support the need for prospective cost-effectiveness studies for the surgical management of appropriately selected patients suffering from flss.
abstract    macrophages are an important natural target cell for hiv-1, but previous studies of virus entry into these cells are limited, and the involvement of membrane cholesterol and lipid rafts is unknown. cholesterol disruption of macrophage membranes using four pharmacological agents acting by different mechanisms: methyl-β cyclodextrin, nystatin, filipin complex and lovastatin, all significantly inhibited productive hiv entry and reverse transcription. the inhibitory effects of these drugs resulted in decreased virus release from infected cells, and could be substantially reversed by the addition of water-soluble cholesterol. the virus bound equally to cholesterol-disrupted cells even though hiv receptor expression levels were significantly reduced. macrophage cd4 and ccr5 were found to partition with the detergent-resistant membranes with a typical raft-associating protein flotillin-1. hiv particles were observed co-localising with a marker of lipid rafts (ctb-fitc) early post infection. these data suggest that macrophage membrane cholesterol is essential for hiv entry, and implicate lipid raft involvement.  rice mutant database (rmd, ) is an archive for collecting, managing and searching information of the t-dna insertion mutants generated by an enhancer trap system. we have generated ∼129 000 rice mutant (enhancer trap) lines that are now being gathered in the database. information collected in rmd includes mutant phenotypes, reporter-gene expression patterns, flanking sequences of t-dna insertional sites, seed availability and others, and can be searched by respective id, keyword, nucleotide sequence or protein sequence on the website. this database is both a mutant collection for identifying novel genes and regulatory elements and a pattern line collection for ectopic expression of target gene in specific tissue or at specific growth stage.
background maternal diabetes alters gene expression leading to neural tube defects (ntds) in the developing brain. the mechanistic pathways that deregulate the gene expression remain unknown. it is hypothesized that exposure of neural stem cells (nscs) to high glucose/hyperglycemia results in activation of epigenetic mechanisms which alter gene expression and cell fate during brain development. methods and findings nscs were isolated from normal pregnancy and streptozotocin induced-diabetic pregnancy and cultured in physiological glucose. in order to examine hyperglycemia induced epigenetic changes in nscs, chromatin reorganization, global histone status at lysine 9 residue of histone h3 (acetylation and trimethylation) and global dna methylation were examined and found to be altered by hyperglycemia. in nscs, hyperglycemia increased the expression of dcx (doublecortin) and pafah1b1 (platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase, isoform 1b, subunit 1) proteins concomitant with decreased expression of four micrornas (mmu-mir-200a, mmu-mir-200b, mmu-mir-466a-3p and mmu-mir-466 d-3p) predicted to target these genes. knockdown of specific micrornas in nscs resulted in increased expression of dcx and pafah1b1 proteins confirming target prediction and altered nsc fate by increasing the expression of neuronal and glial lineage markers. conclusion/interpretation this study revealed that hyperglycemia alters the epigenetic mechanisms in nscs, resulting in altered expression of some development control genes which may form the basis for the ntds. since epigenetic changes are reversible, they may be valuable therapeutic targets in order to improve fetal outcomes in diabetic pregnancy.  maternal diabetes causes congenital malformations in various organs including the neural tube in fetuses. in this study, we have analyzed the differential gene expression profiling in the cranial neural tube of embryos from diabetic and control mice by using the oligonucleotide microarray. expression patterns of genes and proteins that are differentially expressed in the cranial neural tube were further examined by the real‐time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. proliferation index and apoptosis were examined by brdu (5‐bromo‐2‐deoxyuridine) labeling and tunel (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick‐end labeling) assay, respectively. embryos (e11.5) of diabetic pregnancies displayed distortion in neuroepithelia of the cranial neural tube. microarray analysis revealed that a total of 390 genes exhibited more than twofold changes in expression level in the cranial neural tube of embryos from diabetic mice. several genes involving apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neurons in the cranial neural tube were differentially expressed in embryos of diabetic pregnancy. in addition, maternal diabetes perturbed the development of choroid plexus and ventricular systems and reduced the production of proteins such as ttr and igf2 in the developing brain, indicating that these changes could impair the survival and proliferation of neuroepithelial cells and neurogenesis in embryos of diabetic mice. it is concluded that altered expression of a variety of genes involved in brain development is associated with cranial neural tube dysmorphogenesis that may subsequently contribute to intellectual impairment of the offspring of a diabetic mother. © 2008 wiley‐liss, inc.
chronic alcohol consumption reduces nitric oxide synthase-dependent responses of pial arterioles via mechanisms that remain uncertain. in addition, the temporal effects of alcohol on pial arterioles is unclear. thus our goals were to examine the role of oxygen-derived free radicals in alcohol-induced impairment of cerebrovascular reactivity and the temporal effect of alcohol on reactivity of pial arterioles. sprague-dawley rats were pair-fed a liquid diet with or without alcohol for 2-3 wk, 2-3 mo, or 5-6 mo. we measured the in vivo diameter of pial arterioles in response to nitric oxide synthase-dependent dilators acetylcholine and adp and the nitric oxide synthase-independent dilator nitroglycerin. in nonalcohol-fed rats, acetylcholine (1.0 and 10 microm) and adp (10 and 100 microm) produced dose-related dilatation of pial arterioles. whereas there was no difference in reactivity of arterioles to the agonists in rats fed the nonalcohol and alcohol diets for a period of 2-3 wk, there was a significant impairment in reactivity of arterioles to acetylcholine and adp, but not nitroglycerin, in rats fed the alcohol diet for longer durations. we then found that treatment with superoxide dismutase did not alter baseline diameter of pial arterioles in nonalcohol-fed or alcohol-fed rats, but significantly improved impaired nitric oxide synthase-dependent dilatation of pial arterioles in alcohol-fed rats. thus our findings suggest a temporal relationship in the effects of alcohol on reactivity of pial arterioles and that impaired nitric oxide synthase-dependent cerebral vasodilatation during chronic alcohol consumption may be related, in part, to enhanced release of oxygen-derived free radicals.  the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ethanol exposure on responses of cerebral arterioles in vivo. rats were fed liquid diets with or without ethanol for 2-3 mo. using intravital microscopy, we measured diameter of cerebral arterioles in non-ethanol- and ethanol-fed rats in response to acetylcholine, histamine, adp, the thromboxane analogue (u-46619), and nitroglycerin. in non-ethanol-fed rats, acetylcholine, histamine, and adp produced dose-related dilatation of cerebral arterioles. in ethanol-fed rats, however, acetylcholine produced vasoconstriction, and vasodilatation in response to histamine and adp was impaired. dilatation of cerebral arterioles in response to nitroglycerin and vasoconstriction in response to the thromboxane analogue (u-46619) were similar in non-ethanol-fed and ethanol-fed rats. thus these findings suggest that chronic ethanol exposure impairs responses of cerebral arterioles to agonists, which produce dilatation via the release of an endothelium-derived relaxing factor. we speculate that impaired vasodilatation coupled with preservation of vasoconstriction in ethanol-fed rats may have important implications for the pathogenesis of stroke during chronic alcohol ingestion.
several bioengineering approaches have been proposed for peripheral nervous system repair, with limited results and still open questions about the underlying molecular mechanisms. we assessed the biological processes that occur after the implantation of collagen scaffold with a peculiar porous micro-structure of the wall in a rat sciatic nerve transection model compared to commercial collagen conduits and nerve crush injury using functional, histological and genome wide analyses. we demonstrated that within 60 days, our conduit had been completely substituted by a normal nerve. gene expression analysis documented a precise sequential regulation of known genes involved in angiogenesis, schwann cells/axons interactions and myelination, together with a selective modulation of key biological pathways for nerve morphogenesis induced by porous matrices. these data suggest that the scaffold's micro-structure profoundly influences cell behaviors and creates an instructive micro-environment to enhance nerve morphogenesis that can be exploited to improve recovery and understand the molecular differences between repair and regeneration.  this report describes a new approach for fabricating microchannels within three‐dimensional electrospun constructs. these key features serve to mimic the fascicular architecture and fibrous extracellular matrix found in native nerve. both electrospun fibers and multi‐channeled structure nerve guides have become areas of increasing interest for their beneficial roles in nerve repair. however, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a guide that incorporates both. multiple parallel channels provide a greater number of defined paths and increased surface area compared to cylindrical guides. additionally, the fibrous nature of electrospun fibers permits better mass transport than solid‐walled constructs. the flexible fabrication scheme allows tailoring of nerve guide parameters such as channel diameters ranging from 33 to 176 µm and various wall thicknesses. channel and fiber structures were assessed by optical and electron microscope images. geometric calculations estimated a porosity of over 85% for these guides with 16% or less from the channels. in vitro culture with schwann cells demonstrated cellular infiltration into channels with restricted migration between fibers. finally, cell proliferation and survival throughout the guide indicates that this design warrants future in vivo examination. biotechnol. bioeng. 2012; 109:1571–1582. © 2011 wiley periodicals, inc.
polo-like kinase-1 (plk1) is activated before mitosis by aurora a and its cofactor bora. in mitosis, bora is degraded in a manner dependent on plk1 kinase activity and the e3 ubiquitin ligase scf-βtrcp. here, we show that plk1 is also required for the timely destruction of its activator aurora a in late anaphase. it has been shown that aurora a destruction is controlled by the auxiliary subunit cdh1 of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (apc/c). remarkably, we found that plk1-depletion prevented the efficient dephosphorylation of cdh1 during mitotic exit. plk1 mediated its effect on cdh1, at least in part, through direct phosphorylation of the human phosphatase cdc14a, controlling the phosphorylation state of cdh1. we conclude that plk1 facilitates efficient aurora a degradation through apc/c-cdh1 activation after mitosis, with a potential role for hcdc14a.  we show that human cdc14a phosphatase interacts with interphase centrosomes, and that this interaction is independent of microtubules and cdc14a phosphatase activity, but requires active nuclear export. disrupting the nuclear export signal (nes) led to cdc14a being localized in nucleoli, which in unperturbed cells selectively contain cdc14b (ref. 1). conditional overproduction of cdc14a, but not its phosphatase-dead or nes-deficient mutants, or cdc14b, resulted in premature centrosome splitting and formation of supernumerary mitotic spindles. in contrast, downregulation of endogenous cdc14a by short inhibitory rna duplexes (sirna) induced mitotic defects including impaired centrosome separation and failure to undergo productive cytokinesis. consequently, both overexpression and downregulation of cdc14a caused aberrant chromosome partitioning into daughter cells. these results indicate that cdc14a is a physiological regulator of the centrosome duplication cycle, which, when disrupted, can lead to genomic instability in mammalian cells.
candida albicans is a common opportunistic fungal pathogen, causing both superficial candidiasis and life-threatening systemic infections in immune-compromised individuals. calcium signaling is responsible for this pathogen in responding to several stresses, such as antifungal drugs, alkaline ph and membrane-perturbing agents. our recent study revealed that it is also involved in oxidative stress response. in this study, we investigated the effect of verapamil, an l-type voltage-gated calcium channel blocker, on oxidative stress response in this fungus. the addition of verapamil resulted in increased sensitivity to the oxidative agent h2o2, which is associated with a decrease of calcium fluctuation under the stress. moreover, this agent caused enhanced oxidative stress, with increased levels of ros and enhanced dysfunction of the mitochondria under the oxidative stress. further investigations in sod activity, gsh contents and expression of oxidative stress response-related genes indicated that the effect of verapamil is related to the repression of oxidative stress response. our findings demonstrated that verapamil has an inhibitory effect on oxidative stress response, confirming the relationship between calcium signaling and oxidative stress in c. albicans. therefore, calcium channels may be potential targets for therapy to enhance the efficacy of oxidative stress against c. albicans-related infections.  abstract the ability of the major systemic fungal pathogen of humans, candida albicans, to sense and respond to reactive oxygen species (ros), such as h2o2 generated by the host immune system, is required for survival in the host. however, the intracellular signaling mechanisms underlying such responses are poorly understood. here, we show that thioredoxin (trx1), in addition to its antioxidant activity, plays a central role in coordinating the response of c. albicans to ros by regulating multiple pathways. in particular, trx1 function is important for h2o2-induced phosphorylation of the hog1 stress-activated protein kinase and to reverse h2o2-induced oxidation and activation of the ap-1 like transcription factor cap1. furthermore, trx1 regulates h2o2-induced hyperpolarized bud growth in a mechanism that involves activation of the rad53 checkpoint kinase. consistent with its key roles in responses to ros, cells lacking trx1 displayed significantly attenuated virulence in a murine model of c. albicans systemic infection. collectively, our data indicate that trx1 has a multifaceted role in h2o2 signaling and promotes c. albicans survival in the host.
backgroundvertebrate alpha (α)- and beta (β)-globin gene families exemplify the way in which genomes evolve to produce functional complexity. from tandem duplication of a single globin locus, the α- and β-globin clusters expanded, and then were separated onto different chromosomes. the previous finding of a fossil β-globin gene (ω) in the marsupial α-cluster, however, suggested that duplication of the α-β cluster onto two chromosomes, followed by lineage-specific gene loss and duplication, produced paralogous α- and β-globin clusters in birds and mammals. here we analyse genomic data from an egg-laying monotreme mammal, the platypus (ornithorhynchus anatinus), to explore haemoglobin evolution at the stem of the mammalian radiation.resultsthe platypus α-globin cluster (chromosome 21) contains embryonic and adult α- globin genes, a β-like ω-globin gene, and the gby globin gene with homology to cytoglobin, arranged as 5'-ζ-ζ'-αd-α3-α2-α1-ω-gby-3'. the platypus β-globin cluster (chromosome 2) contains single embryonic and adult globin genes arranged as 5'-ε-β-3'. surprisingly, all of these globin genes were expressed in some adult tissues. comparison of flanking sequences revealed that all jawed vertebrate α-globin clusters are flanked by mpg-c16orf35 and luc7l, whereas all bird and mammal β-globin clusters are embedded in olfactory genes. thus, the mammalian α- and β-globin clusters are orthologous to the bird α- and β-globin clusters respectively.conclusionwe propose that α- and β-globin clusters evolved from an ancient mpg-c16orf35-α-β-gby-luc7l arrangement 410 million years ago. a copy of the original β (represented by ω in marsupials and monotremes) was inserted into an array of olfactory genes before the amniote radiation (>315 million years ago), then duplicated and diverged to form orthologous clusters of β-globin genes with different expression profiles in different lineages.  we have explored the evolution of the alpha-globin gene family by comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses of mammalian alpha-globin genes. our analyses reveal the existence of a new alpha-globin gene lineage in mammals that is related to the alpha(d)-globin genes of birds, squamates and turtles. the gene is located in the middle of the alpha-globin gene cluster of a marsupial, sminthopsis macroura and of humans. it exists in a wide variety of additional mammals, including pigs, cows, cats, and dogs, but is a pseudogene in american marsupials. evolutionary analyses suggest that the gene has generally evolved under purifying selection, indicative of a functional gene. the presence of mrna products in humans, pigs, and cows also suggest that the gene is expressed and likely to be functional. the analyses support the hypothesis that the alpha(d)-globin gene lineage has an ancient evolutionary origin that predates the divergence of amniotes. the structural similarity of alpha-globin gene clusters of marsupials and humans suggest that an eight gene cluster (5'-zeta2-zeta1-alpha(d)-alpha3-alpha2-alpha1-theta-omega-3'), including seven alpha-like genes and one beta-like globin gene (omega-globin) existed in the common ancestor of all marsupial and eutherian mammals. this basic structure has remained relatively stable in marsupials and in the lineage leading to humans, although omega-globin has been lost from the alpha-globin gene cluster of humans.
linear discriminant analysis (lda) is a commonly-used feature extraction technique. for matrix-variate data such as spatio-spectral electroencephalogram (eeg), matrix-variate lda formulations have been proposed. compared to the standard vector-variate lda, these formulations assume a separable structure for the within-class and between-class scatter matrices; these structured parameters can be estimated more accurately with a limited number of training samples. however, separable scatters do not fit some data, resulting in aggravated performance for matrix-variate methods. this paper first proposes a common framework for the vector-variate lda with non-separable scatters and our previously proposed solution with separable scatters. then, a regularization of the non-separable scatter estimates toward the separable estimates is introduced. this novel regularized framework integrates vector-variate and matrix-variate approaches, and allows the estimated scatter matrices to adapt to the data characteristics. experiments on data set v from bci competition iii demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a considerable classification performance gain.  linear discriminant analysis (lda) is a well-known scheme for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of labeled data in a vector space. lda has been extended to two-dimensional lda (2dlda), which is an iterative algorithm for data in matrix representation. in this paper, we propose non-iterative algorithms for 2dlda. experimental results show that the non-iterative algorithms achieve competitive recognition rates with the iterative 2dlda, while they are computationally more efficient than the iterative 2dlda
background the purpose of this study was to review surgery-proven lumbar disc herniation in adolescents with an emphasis on the distinguishing features.   methods twenty-eight adolescents between 14 and 18 years old had lumbar discectomy after conservative treatment for 9 months. indications for surgery were intractable pain and failure of conservative treatment for more than 6 weeks. lumbar spine apophyseal ring fracture was found in 10 of the 24 patients (42%) who had computed tomography studies. seven patients had piecemeal excision of the fractured apophysis together with the discectomy.   results all but three patients could raise their leg more than 70 degrees after the operation. the latest follow-up was conducted an average of 6.1 years after surgery. good or excellent results were noted in 93% of the patients. two patients had follow-up operations for recurrent disc herniation and wound infection.   conclusion apophyseal ring fracture was a feature in adolescent disc herniation that requires surgical intervention. early computed tomography study is proposed to detect apophyseal ring lesion, which may lead to failure of conservative treatment. excision of the fractured ring apophysis is suggested in addition to discectomy when the canal space is occupied.  study design. the authors examined a case series of patients under the age of 18 years treated for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. objectives. to evaluate postoperative and long-term results of surgery in patients younger than 18 years. summary of background data. there are only a few series, with controversial results, available on the surgical treatment of disc herniation in growing patients. methods. between 1975 and 1991, a consecutive series of 129 patients 9–18 years of age (average age, 16.2 years) underwent surgery for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. low back pain associated with leg pain was the main clinical symptom in 106 subjects (82%), back pain in 17 (13%), and leg pain in 6 (5%). results. short-term results were excellent or good for 123 cases (95%), with complete pain relief in 97 (75%) and moderate but incomplete relief in 26 (20%). a total of 98 (76%) long-term responses obtained at a mean follow-up of 12.4 years revealed excellent outcomes in 40% of the cases, good in 47%, and poor in 13%. ten patients (10%) underwent reintervention after 9 years on average (2 fusions and 8 re-explorations for herniated disc). conclusions. results have confirmed a tendency for outcomes to deteriorate between the short-term and long-term follow-up in young patients treated by discectomy: this tendency and the rate of reintervention (10%) confirmed the need for long-term follow-up of children and adolescents treated for disc herniation.
objective. type 1 diabetes has a bad prognosis concerning the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (cvd). the purpose of this study was to evaluate different possible new risk indices for cvd in children with type 1 diabetes. material and methods. the present study included 30 children with diabetes (mean hba1c 9.8%), aged between 4.7 and 18.6 years and with no clinical evidence of vascular complications, and 30 healthy subjects matched by sex, age and body mass index. blood pressure was measured and blood samples were obtained for lipid profile, creatinine, glucose, high sensitive c‐reactive protein (hscrp), intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 (icam‐1), asymmetric dimethylarginine (adma), adiponectin and homocysteine. results. children with diabetes had significantly higher blood pressure, plasma hscrp, icam‐1, adiponectin levels and lower homocysteine, adma concentrations than their control subjects. in multivariate regression analysis, the best predictors for systolic blood pressure were diabetes group, plasma homocysteine concentration and bmi (adj r2 = 0.38, p<0.0001), and for diastolic blood pressure diabetes group and triglycerides level (adj r2 = 0.27, p<0.0001). conclusions. children with diabetes, in view of their higher future risk of cvd, are characterized by a higher concentration of protective adiponectin and paradoxically lower blood concentrations of some other possible risk markers of atherosclerosis, i.e. adma and homocysteine compared to healthy children.  adiponectin, also referred to as acrp30, adipoq, and gbp28, is a plasma protein exclusively produced by adipose tissue and a possible insulin-sensitizing agent (1–6). serum adiponectin levels are negatively correlated to bmi in healthy individuals and decreased in type 2 diabetic patients (1–6). however, serum adiponectin levels in type 1 diabetes have not been elucidated.  we examined the serum adiponectin concentrations in 46 type 1 diabetic patients (21 males and 25 females) and compared them with those of bmi-matched healthy control subjects (17 males and 19 females). mean age was 33 ± 3 and 33 ± 4 years, bmi was 19.8 ± 0.5 and 19.9 ± 0.6 kg/m2, hba1c level was 9.7± 0.7 and 10.4 ± 0.6%, duration of diabetes was 3.2 ± 0.9 and 3.4 ± 1.3 years, and urinary c-peptide excretion was 18.4 ± 4.3 and 18.0 ± 2.4 μg/day in male and …
the ability to inhibit irrelevant information is essential for coping with the demands of everyday life. inhibitory deficits are present in all stages of dementia and commonly observed in people with parkinson's disease (pwpd). inhibition is frequently tested with the stroop test, but this may lack ecological validity. this study investigates inhibitory control in people with alzheimer's disease dementia (pwd) and pwpd using the hayling sentence completion test (hsct), which aspires to be a more ecologically valid task. a total of 117 people completed the hsct, a test where participants have to complete a sentence with an unrelated word. the sample comprised 30 pwd, 33 pwpd, and 54 healthy older controls. we compared response times and the number and type of errors across the three groups. completion time in part b (inhibition) did not distinguish between pwd, pwpd, and controls when controlling for the initiation speed, but a higher proportion of category a errors (producing a word that fits the sentence when instructed otherwise) was a unique characteristic of inferior performance in pwd and pwpd. while not part of the standard test scoring protocol, controlling for the initiation speed and distinguishing between speed and accuracy in test performance appear to be essential for accurate evaluation of the inhibitory control in hsct in older people. the findings suggest that the hsct may be sensitive to verbal suppression deficits and may provide insight into inhibitory control in pwd and pwpd.  successful communication requires speakers to consider their listeners׳ perspectives. little is known about how this ability changes in alzheimer׳s disease (ad) although such knowledge could reveal the cognitive mechanisms fundamental to perspective-taking ability, and reveal which cognitive deficits are fundamental to communication disorders in ad. patients with mild to moderate ad and age and education matched controls were tested in a communicative perspective-taking task, and on measures of executive control, general cognitive functioning, and lexical retrieval. patients׳ ability to perform the perspective-taking task was significantly correlated with performance on measures of general cognitive functioning, visual scanning and construction, response conflict and attention. measures of lexical retrieval tended not to be correlated with performance on the communication task with one exception: semantic but not letter fluency predicted a derived score of perspective-taking ability. these findings broaden our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying perspective taking, and suggest that impairments in perspective taking in ad occur during utterance planning, and at a relatively early processing stage which involves rapid visual scanning and problem solving, rather than during retrieval of lexical items needed to speak. more broadly, these data reveal executive function and semantic deficits, but not problems with lexical retrieval, as more fundamental to the basis of cognitive changes associated with ad.
system identification is defined as finding mathematical models of systems, using experimental measurements and observations. this paper proposes an identification approach based on the singular spectrum analysis (ssa) and least squares support vector machines (ls-svm) model. the ssa is used in the pre-processing stage for de-noising the measurement data and then the ls-svm model is trained by the de-noised data. the proposed approach was employed for identification of two nonlinear systems. the simulation results demonstrated the promising performance of the proposed approach and favorable capabilities of the ssa for nonlinear system identification.  support vector machines is a powerful methodology for solving problems in nonlinear classification, function estimation and density estimation which has also led recently to many new developments in kernel based learning in general. in these methods one solves convex optimization problems, typically quadratic programs. we focus on least squares support vector machines which are reformulations to standard svms that lead to solving linear kkt systems. least squares support vector machines are closely related to regularization networks and gaussian processes but additionally emphasize and exploit primaldual interpretations from optimization theory. in view of interior point algorithms such ls-svm kkt systems can be considered as a core problem. where needed the obtained solutions can be robustified and/or sparsified. as an alternative to a top-down choice of the cost function, methods from robust statistics are employed in a bottom-up fashion for further improving the estimates. we explain the natural links between ls-svm classifiers and kernel fisher discriminant analysis. the framework is further extended towards unsupervised learning by considering pca analysis and its kernel version as a one-class modelling problem. this leads to new primal-dual support vector machine formulations for kernel pca and kernel canonical correlation analysis. furthermore, ls-svm formulations are mentioned towards recurrent networks and control, thereby extending the methods from static to dynamic problems. in general, support vector machines may pose heavy computational challenges for large data sets. for this purpose, we propose a method of fixed size ls-svm where the estimation is done in the primal space in relation to a nyström sampling with active selection of support vectors and we discuss extensions to committee networks. the methods will be illustrated by several benchmark and real-life applications.
the p300 of the event-related potential is typically obtained for infrequent target stimuli that are embedded in a sequence of frequent irrelevant stimuli. the p300 has been suggested as a marker of high-level cognitive processing and might be useful in ophthalmology to confirm the diagnosis of a functional disorder. however, typical p300 measurements require relatively lengthy recording sessions. it would therefore be desirable to minimize the required time and to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio by finding the optimal balance between parameters such as stimulus probability and the number of target trials or the recording time. this is different from previous studies, which assessed the amplitude only. we recorded event-related potentials to visual stimuli using standard oddball paradigms with various target frequencies ranging from 2:1 (target majority) to 1:16 (massive non-target majority). we compared the signal-to-noise ratios for a fixed number of target trials as well as for a fixed total recording time and assessed effects of the immediate stimulus history. as expected, p300 amplitudes depend strongly on target infrequency. this did not reach saturation within the range tested. for a given number of target trials, the signal-to-noise ratio also increases with target infrequency. for a given recording duration, the signal-to-noise ratio is optimal around 1:8. in the 1:4 condition, the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved by excluding trials that were preceded by a target trial.  to examine the topographic relationship of p3(00) between the visual and auditory modalities, especially to examine whether there are any modality-specific hemispheric differences of p3 in normal adults. methods: the p3s were recorded from the same 41 normal right-handed males between the ages of 20 and 33 in both a typical auditory oddball task and a visual oddball paradigm with novel stimuli, with an extensive set of 61 scalp electrodes. in addition to the visual comparison and quantitative assessment of current source density (csd) maps between the two modalities, canonical correlation analyses on the p3 raw amplitudes and examination of interaction effects of modality × location on both raw and normalized p3 data were performed. results: the canonical correlation between modalities was generally high, especially at the left parietal brain region. there were no significant hemispheric effects in anterior brain but significant left-greater- than-right hemispheric effects in posterior brain regions in both modalities; modality-specific hemispheric effect was observed only at the parietal region. strong surface current density activities were observed in the midline parietal-occipital area, and left and right boundary areas of temporal and inferior frontal region. conclusions: the topographic similarities between p3s recorded in the visual and auditory modality outnumber the differences. combining data from csd assessments and profile analysis of p3 topography support the hypothesis of multiple generators of p3 that are differentially active in processing stimuli from different sensory modalities and are not symmetrically distributed between the two hemispheres.
in many real-world optimization problems, the objective function evaluation is subject to noise, and we cannot obtain the exact objective value. evolutionary algorithms (eas), a type of general-purpose randomized optimization algorithm, have been shown to be able to solve noisy optimization problems well. however, previous theoretical analyses of eas mainly focused on noise-free optimization, which makes the theoretical understanding largely insufficient for the noisy case. meanwhile, the few existing theoretical studies under noise often considered the one-bit noise model, which flips a randomly chosen bit of a solution before evaluation; while in many realistic applications, several bits of a solution can be changed simultaneously. in this paper, we study a natural extension of one-bit noise, the bit-wise noise model, which independently flips each bit of a solution with some probability. we analyze the running time of the ($$1+1$$1+1)-ea solving onemax and leadingones under bit-wise noise for the first time, and derive the ranges of the noise level for polynomial and super-polynomial running time bounds. the analysis on leadingones under bit-wise noise can be easily transferred to one-bit noise, and improves the previously known results. since our analysis discloses that the ($$1+1$$1+1)-ea can be efficient only under low noise levels, we also study whether the sampling strategy can bring robustness to noise. we prove that using sampling can significantly increase the largest noise level allowing a polynomial running time, that is, sampling is robust to noise.  a combination tow and pressure relief valve for use in a hydraulic fluid circuit used in a hydraulically driven wide area lawn mower. the valve includes a cylindrical valve body having a hexagonal head. a slideable valve tip with a shank and a valve head has its shank slidably mounted within the valve body. the valve tip is biased by a spring to move in a direction away from the hex head. in operation, the valve is inserted into a suitable chamber placed in series with a bypass passage. the valve tends to block the bypass passage under steady state conditions. when a surge in hydraulic pressure occurs, as would occur in response to operator input or at startup, the hydraulic fluid overcomes the bias of the spring and urges the valve tip away from the otherwise blocked orifice which links the bypass passage to the chamber. opening the orifice tends to diminish the magnitude of the pressure peak and helps eliminate jerky starts of the mower. the spring eventually overcomes the reduced hydraulic fluid pressure and returns the head of the valve tip into a sealed relationship with the bypass passage orifice. a shoulder nut permits the valve to be secured at a fixed position within the chamber. varying the position of the valve within the chamber permits adjustment of the absolute value of the peak pressure which will be reached within the bypass passage. loosening the valve further permits its use as a tow valve, so that the associated mower can be moved without skidding of the mower tires or actually starting the mower engine. closing the valve further permits maximum operating pressure availability for larger and heavier equipment.
we propose a new built-in self-test (bist) method based on a combination of a pseudo-random test method with a deterministic test. this enables us to reach a high fault coverage in a short test time and with a l ow area overhead. the main feature of the method is that there are no memory elements to store the deterministic test patterns; the test pat terns are being produced by a transformation of the non-testing pseudo-random patterns. this transformation is being done by a purely combinational block, while we try to keep this block as small as possible. our method can be apprehended as a generalization of a bit-fixing method. we synthesize the transformation logic by a slightly modified column-matching algorithm proposed before.  a new design methodology for a pattern generator is proposed, formulated in the context of on-chip bist. the design methodology is circuit-specific and uses synthesis techniques to design bist generators. the pattern generator consists of two components: a pseudorandom pattern generator (like an lfsr or, preferably, a glfsr) and a combinational logic to map the outputs of the pseudorandom pattern generator. this combinational logic is synthesized to produce a given set of target patterns by mapping the outputs of the pseudorandom pattern generator. it is shown that, for a particular cut, an area-efficient combinational logic block can be designed/synthesized to achieve 100 (or almost 100) percent single stuck-at fault coverage using a small number of test the this method is significantly different from weighted pattern generation and can guarantee testing of all hard-to-detect faults without expensive test point insertion. experimental results on common benchmark netlists demonstrate that the fault coverage of the proposed pattern generator is significantly higher compared to conventional pattern generation techniques. the design technique for the logic mapper is unique and can be used effectively to improve existing pattern generators for combinational logic and scan-based bist structures.
the ghmp genes family, a unique class of atp-dependent enzymes, consists of galactokinases, homoserine kinases, mevalonate kinases and phosphomevalonate kinase etc. it was implicated in the biosynthesis of isoprenes and amino acids as well as in carbohydrate metabolism. previous studies mainly focused on the structure, catalytic mechanism or function in abiotic stress signaling. in this study, we integrated the research progress on ghmp genes and identified 12 members (five previously discovered and seven newly identified here) of this family in arabidopsis thaliana. the gene ontology, phylogenetic relationship, motifs, cis-acting element, expression profiles, structures and protein–protein interaction network of ghmp family were analyzed. the neighbor-joining tree and cluster of gene structures indicated that the 12 members were divided into two classes. the three motifs in the ghmp family were highly conserved among the ghmp family by multiple em for motif elicitation, providing further proof on their phylogenetic relationship. additionally, prediction on cis-acting elements indicated that these genes were likely to be involved in multiple responses stimulated by various hormones and abiotic stress. it is roughly consistent with the data of microarray. the identification and bioinformatic analysis of ghmp family in arabidopsis thaliana could provide reference data for further study on their biological functions, especially in the responsiveness to hormones and stress signaling.  kinases that catalyze phosphorylation of sugars, called here sugar kinases, can be divided into at least three distinct nonhomologous families. the first is the hexokinase family, which contains many prokaryotic and eukaryotic sugar kinases with diverse specificities, including a new member, rhamnokinase from salmonella typhimurium. the three‐dimensional structure of hexokinase is known and can be used to build models of functionally important regions of other kinases in this family. the second is the ribokinase family, of unknown three‐dimensional structure, and comprises pro‐ and eukaryotic ribokinases, bacterial fructokinases, the minor 6‐phosphofructokinase 2 from escherichia coli, 6‐phosphotagatokinase, 1‐phosphofructokinase, and, possibly, inosine‐guanosine kinase. the third family, also of unknown three‐dimensional structure, contains several bacterial and yeast galactokinases and eukaryotic mevalonate and phosphomevalonate kinases and may have a substrate binding region in common with homoserine kinases.
abstract background current standards for fine particulates and nitrogen dioxide are under revision. patients with cardiovascular disease have been identified as the largest group which need to be protected from effects of urban air pollution. methods we sought to estimate associations between indicators of urban air pollution and daily mortality using time series of daily tsp, pm 10 , pm 2.5 , no 2 , so 2 , o 3 and nontrauma deaths in vienna (austria) 2000–2004. we used polynomial distributed lag analysis adjusted for seasonality, daily temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and incidence of influenza as registered by sentinels. results all three particulate measures and no 2 were associated with mortality from all causes and from ischemic heart disease and copd at all ages and in the elderly. the magnitude of the effect was largest for pm 2.5 and no 2 . best predictor of mortality increase lagged 0–7 days was pm 2.5 (for ischemic heart disease and copd) and no 2 (for other heart disease and all causes). total mortality increase, lagged 0–14 days, per 10 μg m −3 was 2.6% for pm 2.5 and 2.9% for no 2 , mainly due to cardiopulmonary and cerebrovascular causes. conclusion acute and subacute lethal effects of urban air pollution are predicted by pm 2.5 and no 2 increase even at relatively low levels of these pollutants. this is consistent with results on hospital admissions and the lack of a threshold. while harvesting (reduction of mortality after short increase due to premature deaths of most sensitive persons) seems to be of minor importance, deaths accumulate during 14 days after an increase of air pollutants. the limit values for pm 2.5 and no 2 proposed for 2010 in the european union are unable to prevent serious health effects.  air pollution consists of both gaseous and particulate-matter pollutants. the former include nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3), and sulphur dioxide (so2). the latter consist of particulate matter of varying aerodynamic diameter, as defined by cutoff points—for example, particles with diameters of ,10 mm (pm10) or ,2.5 mm (pm2.5). because of their small size, these particles can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and deposited in the alveoli. why should cardiologists care about ambient air? it has long been known that air pollution can adversely affect human health. extreme levels of pollution may cause markedly increased mortality rates; in this regard one often refers to the meuse valley fog of 1930 or the london smog of 1952. these episodes initiated successful efforts and legislation to reduce air pollution. nevertheless, even at current ambient pollution levels, the relation between pollution and excess morbidity and mortality still exists. however, the nature of the pollutants and the type of health effects have shifted, with a special emphasis now being placed on the heart rather than the lungs. maı̂tre et al. gathered the available epidemiological evidence on the association between coronary disease and air pollution at current ambient concentrations. from both biological and public health perspectives, one should distinguish between acute and long-term effects of air pollution.
topsoil from arid regions is the main source of dust clouds that move through the earth's atmosphere, and microbial communities within these soils can survive long-range dispersion. microbial abundance and chemical composition were analyzed in topsoil from various desert regions. statistical analyses showed that microbial direct counts were strongly positively correlated with calcium concentrations and negatively correlated with silicon concentrations. while variance between deserts was expected, it was interesting to note differences between sample sites within a given desert region, illustrating the 'patchy' nature of microbial communities in desert environments.  charles darwin, like others before him, collected aeolian dust over the atlantic ocean and sent it to christian gottfried ehrenberg in berlin. ehrenberg's collection is now housed in the museum of natural history and contains specimens that were gathered at the onset of the industrial revolution. geochemical analyses of this resource indicated that dust collected over the atlantic in 1838 originated from the western sahara, while molecular-microbiological methods demonstrated the presence of many viable microbes. older samples sent to ehrenberg from barbados almost two centuries ago also contained numbers of cultivable bacteria and fungi. many diverse ascomycetes, and eubacteria were found. scanning electron microscopy and cultivation suggested that bacillus megaterium, a common soil bacterium, was attached to historic sand grains, and it was inoculated onto dry sand along with a non-spore-forming control, the gram-negative soil bacterium rhizobium sp. ngr234. on sand b. megaterium quickly developed spores, which survived for extended periods and even though the numbers of ngr234 steadily declined, they were still considerable after months of incubation. thus, microbes that adhere to saharan dust can live for centuries and easily survive transport across the atlantic.
we performed a systematic review of the behavioral lifestyle intervention trials conducted in the united states published between 1990 and 2011 that included a maintenance phase of at least six months, to identify intervention features that promote weight loss maintenance in african american women. seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. generally, african american women lost less weight during the intensive weight loss phase and maintained a lower % of their weight loss compared to caucasian women. the majority of studies failed to describe the specific strategies used in the delivery of the maintenance intervention, adherence to those strategies, and did not incorporate a maintenance phase process evaluation making it difficult to identify intervention characteristics associated with better weight loss maintenance. however, the inclusion of cultural adaptations, particularly in studies with a mixed ethnicity/race sample, resulted in less % weight regain for african american women. studies with a formal maintenance intervention and weight management as the primary intervention focus reported more positive weight maintenance outcomes for african american women. nonetheless, our results present both the difficulty in weight loss and maintenance experienced by african american women in behavioral lifestyle interventions.  context behavioral weight loss interventions achieve short-term success, but re-gain is common.   objective to compare 2 weight loss maintenance interventions with a self-directed control group.   design, setting, and participants two-phase trial in which 1032 overweight or obese adults (38% african american, 63% women) with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or both who had lost at least 4 kg during a 6-month weight loss program (phase 1) were randomized to a weight-loss maintenance intervention (phase 2). enrollment at 4 academic centers occurred august 2003-july 2004 and randomization, february-december 2004. data collection was completed in june 2007.   interventions after the phase 1 weight-loss program, participants were randomized to one of the following groups for 30 months: monthly personal contact, unlimited access to an interactive technology-based intervention, or self-directed control. main outcome changes in weight from randomization.   results mean entry weight was 96.7 kg. during the initial 6-month program, mean weight loss was 8.5 kg. after randomization, weight regain occurred. participants in the personal-contact group regained less weight (4.0 kg) than those in the self-directed group (5.5 kg; mean difference at 30 months, -1.5 kg; 95% confidence interval [ci], -2.4 to -0.6 kg; p = .001). at 30 months, weight regain did not differ between the interactive technology-based (5.2 kg) and self-directed groups (5.5 kg; mean difference -0.3 kg; 95% ci, -1.2 to 0.6 kg; p = .51); however, weight regain was lower in the interactive technology-based than in the self-directed group at 18 months (mean difference, -1.1 kg; 95% ci, -1.9 to -0.4 kg; p = .003) and at 24 months (mean difference, -0.9 kg; 95% ci, -1.7 to -0.02 kg; p = .04). at 30 months, the difference between the personal-contact and interactive technology-based group was -1.2 kg (95% ci -2.1 to -0.3; p = .008). effects did not differ significantly by sex, race, age, and body mass index subgroups. overall, 71% of study participants remained below entry weight.   conclusions the majority of individuals who successfully completed an initial behavioral weight loss program maintained a weight below their initial level. monthly brief personal contact provided modest benefit in sustaining weight loss, whereas an interactive technology-based intervention provided early but transient benefit.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct00054925.
although much evidence indicates that rt increases as a function of computational load in many cognitive tasks, quantification of changes in neural activity related to increasing demand of cognitive control has rarely been attempted. in this fmri study, we used a majority function task to quantify the effect of computational load on brain activation, reflecting the mental processes instantiated by cognitive control under conditions of uncertainty. we found that the activation of the frontoparieto-cingulate system as well as the deactivation of the anticorrelated default mode network varied parametrically as a function of information uncertainty, estimated as entropy with an information theoretic model. the current findings suggest that activity changes in the dynamic networks of the brain (especially the frontoparieto-cingulate system) track with information uncertainty, rather than only conflict or other commonly proposed targets of cognitive control.  tasks involving conflict between stimulus dimensions have been shown to activate dorsal anterior cingulate and prefrontal areas. it has been proposed that the dorsal anterior cingulate is involved a domain general process of monitoring conflict, while prefrontal areas are involved in resolving conflict. we examine three tasks that all require people to respond based on one stimulus dimension while ignoring another conflicting dimension, but which vary in the source of conflict. one of the tasks uses language stimuli (stroop effect) and two use nonlanguage spatial conflicts appropriate for children and nonhuman animals. in experiment 1, 12 participants were studied with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) while performing each of the three tasks. reaction times for each of the three tasks were significantly longer in the incongruent condition compared with the congruent condition, demonstrating that each task elicits a conflict. by studying the same people in the same session, we test the hypothesis that conflict activates a similar brain network in the three tasks. significant activations were found in the anterior cingulate and left prefrontal cortex for all three conflict tasks. within these regions, the conflict component demonstrated evidence for significant common activation across the three tasks, although the peak activation point and spatial extent were not identical. other areas demonstrated activation unique to each task. experiments 2-4 provide behavioral evidence indicating considerable independence between conflict operations involved in the tasks. the behavioral and fmri results taken together seem to argue against a single unified network for processing conflict, but instead support either distinct networks for each conflict task or a single network that monitors conflict with different sites used to resolve the conflict.
the current microelectromechanical systems (mems) technology enables the deployment of relatively low-cost wireless sensor networks composed of mems microphone arrays for accurate sound source localization. however, the evaluation and the selection of the most accurate and power-efficient network’s topology are not trivial when considering dynamic mems microphone arrays. although software simulators are usually considered, they consist of high-computational intensive tasks, which require hours to days to be completed. in this paper, we present an fpga-based platform to emulate a network of microphone arrays. our platform provides a controlled simulated acoustic environment, able to evaluate the impact of different network configurations such as the number of microphones per array, the network’s topology, or the used detection method. data fusion techniques, combining the data collected by each node, are used in this platform. the platform is designed to exploit the fpga’s partial reconfiguration feature to increase the flexibility of the network emulator as well as to increase performance thanks to the use of the pci-express high-bandwidth interface. on the one hand, the network emulator presents a higher flexibility by partially reconfiguring the nodes’ architecture in runtime. on the other hand, a set of strategies and heuristics to properly use partial reconfiguration allows the acceleration of the emulation by exploiting the execution parallelism. several experiments are presented to demonstrate some of the capabilities of our platform and the benefits of using partial reconfiguration.  the use of microphone arrays for sound-source localization is a well-researched topic. the response of such sensor arrays is dependent on the quantity of microphones operating on the array. a higher number of microphones, however, increase the computational demand, making real-time response challenging. in this paper, we present a filter-and-sum based architecture and several acceleration techniques to provide accurate sound-source localization in real-time. experiments demonstrate how an accurate sound-source localization is obtained in a couple of milliseconds, independently of the number of microphones. finally, we also propose different strategies to further accelerate the sound-source localization while offering increased angular resolution.
repair of full thickness defects of articular cartilage in the knee is difficult but important to prevent progression to osteoarthritis. the purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical results of osteochondral autograft transplant system (oats) treatment for articular defects of the knee. between 1999 and 2005, 15 knees (14 patients) were treated by the oats technique. age ranged from 27 to 52 years. cartilage defects were up to 3.75 cm2. the mean follow-up was 42 months. knee function was assessed by the lysholmscore and international knee documentation committee (ikdc) subjective knee form. six patients scored good or excellent. no patient had knee instability. twelve of 13 patients returned to sports at an intermediate or high level. the subjective assessment score (0-10) changed from 4.7 before operation to 7.2 afterward (p=0.007). the oats-technique resulted in a decrease in symptoms in patients with localized articular cartilage defects. we consider the oats technique to be an appropriate treatment for cartilage defects to prevent progression of symptoms.  purpose the purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of mosaic-type osteochondral autologous transplantation (oat) and microfracture (mf) procedures for the treatment of the articular cartilage defects of the knee joint in young active athletes.   type of study prospective randomized clinical study.   methods between 1998 and 2002, a total of 60 athletes with a mean age of 24.3 years (range, 15 to 40 years) and with a symptomatic lesion of the articular cartilage in the knee were randomized to undergo either an oat or an mf procedure. only those athletes playing in competitive sports at regional or national levels were included in the study. fifty-seven athletes (95%) were available for a follow-up. there were 28 athletes in the oat group and 29 athletes in the mf group. the mean duration of symptoms was 21.32 +/- 5.57 months and the mean follow-up was 37.1 months (range, 36 to 38 months), and none of the athletes had prior surgical interventions to the affected knee. patients were evaluated using modified hospital for special surgery (hss) and international cartilage repair society (icrs) scores, radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging (mri), and clinical assessment. an independent observer performed a follow-up examination after 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. at 12.4 months postoperatively, arthroscopy with biopsy for histologic evaluation was carried out. a radiologist and a pathologist, both of whom were blinded to each patient's treatment, did the radiologic and histologic evaluations.   results after 37.1 months, both groups had significant clinical improvement (p < .05). according to the modified hss and icrs scores, functional and objective assessment showed that 96% had excellent or good results after oat compared with 52% for the mf procedure (p < .001). at 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery, the hss and icrs showed statistically significantly better results in the oat group (p = .03; p = .006; p = .006). younger athletes did better in both groups. no serious complications were reported. there was 1 failure in the oat group and 9 in the mf group. the icrs cartilage repair assessment for macroscopic evaluation during arthroscopy at 12.4 months showed excellent or good repairs in 84% after oat and in 57% after mf. biopsy specimens were obtained from 58% of the patients and histologic evaluation of repair showed better scores (according to icrs) for the oat group (p < .05). mri evaluation showed excellent or good repairs in 94% after oat compared with 49% after mf. twenty-six (93%) oat patients and 15 (52%) mf patients returned to sports activities at the preinjury level at an average of 6.5 months (range, 4 to 8 months). others showed a decline in sports activity level.   conclusions at an average of 37.1 months (range, 36 to 38 months) follow-up, our prospective, randomized, clinical study in young active athletes under the age of 40 has shown significant superiority of oat over mf for the repair of articular cartilage defects in the knee. we found that only 52% of mf athletes could return to sports at the preinjury level. limitations of our study included a small number of athletes and a relatively short (3-year) follow-up. a long-term follow-up is needed to assess the durability of articular cartilage repair using these methods in young active athletes.   level of evidence level i, therapeutic study, randomized controlled trial, significant difference (a).
the purpose of the present study was twofold. our first purpose was to test whether joint position sense is similar under instructions to memorize hand position and instructions to memorize shoulder and elbow angles. we hypothesized that instructions to memorize hand position would produce smaller errors due to evidence suggesting that the cns directly determines hand position but indirectly determines joint angles from proprioceptive information. our second purpose was to assess biases in joint position sense at various joint angles in a sagittal workspace. we hypothesized that akin to previous single-joint investigations, the shoulder and elbow would demonstrate better joint position sense as joint angles approached 90° during our multi-joint task. sixteen healthy and right-hand-dominant subjects participated in the present investigation. subjects were required to actively position their right upper extremity to one of three targets for a memorization period. after returning to the rest position, subjects then actively repositioned back into the target. we did not find evidence of a substantial difference in joint position sense between instructions to memorize the hand position or joint angle. this finding, when considered in conjunction with other evidence, suggests that studies employing either a joint angle protocol or a hand estimation protocol likely produce results that are similar enough to be compared. proprioception has been shown to be non-uniform across a two-dimensional horizontal workspace. the present investigation provides evidence that proprioception is also non-uniform across a two-dimensional sagittal workspace. specifically, angular errors decrease as upper extremity joint angles approach 90° of flexion and endpoint errors decrease as targets are located increasingly closer to the head.  our understanding of age-related declines in upper limb proprioceptive abilities is limited. furthermore, the extent to which physical activity might ameliorate age-related changes in proprioception is not known. upper limb proprioceptive acuity was examined in young and older (active and sedentary) right-handed adults using a wrist-position-matching task that varied in terms of processing demands. older individuals were also classified according to their participation in tasks specific to the upper limb. errors were greater for older than younger individuals. older sedentary adults showed greater errors and performed movements less smoothly than older active adults. the nonspecific group showed greater errors and longer movement times than the upper-limb-specific group. in older adults, decreased ability to perceive limb position may be related to a sedentary lifestyle and declines associated with memory and transfer of proprioceptive information. performing tasks specific to the upper limbs may reduce age-related declines in proprioception.
the house gecko hemidactylus frenatus is currently displacing an ecologically similar, all-female parthenogenetic gecko h. garnotii on a global scale. we tested the previously proposed hypotheses that resource competition is responsible for this displacement, and that competitive interference occurs through male aggression. we quantified consumption of insect resources and behavioural interactions in dyads and triads composed of different combinations of sexes and species. geckos consumed fewer insects when in pairs than when they were alone, indicating general evidence of resource competition. however, resource consumption of parthenogenetic h. garnotii was not negatively affected by the presence of invasive h. frenatus, suggesting that resource competition is not the primary mechanism of displacement. males were aggressive towards conspecific males, but showed little aggression towards conspecific females and parthenogenetic females; females and parthenogens displayed little aggression. male h. frenatus courted and copulated with both conspecific and heterospecific females in dyads and in triads and, by some measures, showed a preference for larger h. garnotii females. when paired with females or parthenogens, males consumed fewer resources because they turned their attention to courtship. evidence of interspecific courtship suggests that sexual interference may be a more likely mechanism of displacement. our results exclude the possibility that courtship decreases resource consumption in h. garnotii, but further study is required to determine whether interspecific mating disrupts parthenogenetic reproduction. this study demonstrates the importance of testing commonly invoked mechanisms of invasion and displacement by quantifying individual behaviour in an experimental setting.  since the age of exploration began, there has been a drastic breaching of biogeographic barriers that previously had isolated the continental biotas for millions of years. we explore the nature of these recent biotic exchanges and their consequences on evolutionary processes. the direct evidence of evolutionary consequences of the biotic rearrangements is of variable quality, but the results of trajectories are becoming clear as the number of studies increases. there are examples of invasive species altering the evolutionary pathway of native species by competitive exclusion, niche displacement, hybridization, introgression, predation, and ultimately extinction. invaders themselves evolve in response to their interactions with natives, as well as in response to the new abiotic environment. flexibility in behavior, and mutualistic interactions, can aid in the success of invaders in their new environment.
we have compared the ability of a number of μ-opioid receptor (mopr) ligands to activate g proteins with their abilities to induce mopr phosphorylation, to promote association of arrestin-3 and to cause mopr internalization. for a model of g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) activation where all agonists stabilize a single active conformation of the receptor, a close correlation between signaling outputs might be expected. our results show that overall there is a very good correlation between efficacy for g protein activation and arrestin-3 recruitment, whereas a few agonists, in particular endomorphins 1 and 2, display apparent bias toward arrestin recruitment. the agonist-induced phosphorylation of mopr at ser375, considered a key step in mopr regulation, and agonist-induced internalization of mopr were each found to correlate well with arrestin-3 recruitment. these data indicate that for the majority of mopr agonists the ability to induce receptor phosphorylation, arrestin-3 recruitment, and internalization can be predicted from their ability as agonists to activate g proteins. for the prototypic mopr agonist morphine, its relatively weak ability to induce mopr internalization can be explained by its low agonist efficacy.  we investigated the ability of the activated μ‐opioid receptor (mor) to differentiate between myristoylated gαi1 and gαoa type g proteins, and the maximal activity of a range of synthetic and endogenous agonists to activate each g protein. membranes from hek293 cells stably expressing transfected mor were chaotrope extracted to denature endogenous g‐proteins and reconstituted with specific purified g‐proteins. the g subunits were generated in bacteria and were demonstrated to be recognised equivalently to bovine brain purified g protein by cb1 cannabinoid receptors. the ability of agonists to catalyse the mor‐dependent gdp/[35s]gtps exchange was then compared for gαi1 and gαoa. activation of mor by damgo produced a high‐affinity saturable interaction for gαoa (km=20±1 nm) but a low‐affinity interaction with gαi1 (km=116±12 nm). damgo, met‐enkephalin and leucine‐enkephalin displayed maximal g activation among the agonists evaluated. endomorphins 1 and 2, methadone and β‐endorphin activated both g to more than 75% of the maximal response, whereas fentanyl partially activated both g‐proteins. buprenorphine and morphine demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the maximal activities between gαi1 and gαoa. interestingly, damgo, morphine, endomorphins 1 and 2, displayed significant differences in the potencies for the activation of the two g. differences in maximal activity and potency, for gαi1 versus gαoa, are both indicative of agonist selective activation of g‐proteins in response to mor activation. these findings may provide a starting point for the design of drugs that demonstrate greater selectivity between these two g‐proteins and therefore produce a more limited range of effects.
sepsis progression is linked to the imbalance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidant enzymes. sepsis affects multiple organs, but when associated with a chronic inflammatory disease, such as obesity, it may be exacerbated. we hypothesized that obesity could aggravate the oxidative damage to peripheral organs of rats submitted to an animal model of sepsis. male wistar rats aged 8 weeks received hypercaloric nutrition for 2 months to induce obesity. sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (clp) procedure, and sham-operated rats were considered as control group. the experimental groups were divided into sham + eutrophic, sham + obese, clp + eutrophic, and clp + obese. twelve and 24 h after surgery, oxidative damage to lipids and proteins and superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase (cat) activities were evaluated in the liver, lung, kidney, and heart. the data indicate that obese rats subjected to sepsis present oxidative stress mainly in the lung and liver. this alteration reflected an oxidative damage to lipids and proteins and an imbalance of sod and cat levels, especially 24 h after sepsis. it follows that obesity due to its pro-inflammatory phenotype can aggravate sepsis-induced damage in peripheral organs.  there is strong evidence indicating that excess adiposity negatively impacts immune function and host defence in obese individuals. this is a review of research findings concerning the impact of obesity on the immune response to infection, including a discussion of possible mechanisms. obesity is characterised by a state of low-grade, chronic inflammation in addition to disturbed levels of circulating nutrients and metabolic hormones. the impact of these metabolic abnormalities on obesity-related comorbidities has undergone intense scrutiny over the past decade. however, relatively little is known of how the immune system and host defence are influenced by the pro-inflammatory and excess energy milieu of the obese. epidemiological data suggest obese human subjects are at greater risk for nosocomial infections, especially following surgery. additionally, the significance of altered immunity in obese human subjects is emphasised by recent studies reporting obesity to be an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality following infection with the 2009 pandemic influenza a (h1n1) virus. rodent models offer important insight into how metabolic abnormalities associated with excess body weight can impair immunity. however, more research is necessary to understand the specific aspects of immunity that are impaired and what factors are contributing to reduced immunocompetence in the obese. additionally, special consideration of how infection in this at-risk population is managed is required, given that this population may not respond optimally to antimicrobial drugs and vaccination. obesity impacts millions globally, and greater understanding of its associated physiological disturbances is a key public health concern.
medical devices, such as infusion pumps that deliver life-critical medication, are frequently used at home by patient's themselves as a cost saving measure. as individuals age, many are impacted by cognitive decline such that the proper sequencing of steps of a task is forgotten. since the danger of making an error can be quite high. so, to detect errors when patients operate a home medical device, we observe them with multiple cameras and record pump sensor information. we then use a robust approach to recognize actions based on explicitly encoding motion information using mosift, which detects interest points and encodes not only their local appearance but also explicitly models local motion. our goal is to see if the patient has correctly performed the required actions in the prescribed sequence for the device. thus, firstly, we will evaluate how to group the requiring 22 operation steps. secondly, we will analysis the duration of actions, and consider the user adaption. thirdly, the order of actions is introduced, and hmm is used in our algorithm. fourthly, as some actions are very difficult to recognize by computer vision, so the physical sensor information is borrowed in our system. subsequently, we also consider how to fuse the results from different cameras. finally, we also evaluate the performances when we add different numbers of videos from test subjects. from the experiments, we can see that the improvement of our system performance changes from 49% to over 80%. and if we can obtain 6-7 videos from the patients, and add them into the training dataset, the performance of our system with our simplest way can be 83.7%.  the aim of this paper is to address recognition of natural human actions in diverse and realistic video settings. this challenging but important subject has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the lack of realistic and annotated video datasets. our first contribution is to address this limitation and to investigate the use of movie scripts for automatic annotation of human actions in videos. we evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. we present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear svms. the method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard kth action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set. we finally apply the method to learning and classifying challenging action classes in movies and show promising results.
the initiation of drug therapy results in a reduction in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) population, which represents a potential genetic bottleneck. the effect of this drug-induced genetic bottleneck on the population dynamics of the envelope (env) regions has been addressed in several in vivo studies. however, it is difficult to investigate the effect on the env gene of the genetic bottleneck induced not only by entry inhibitors but also by non-entry inhibitors, particularly in vivo. therefore, this study used an in vitro selection system using unique bulk primary isolates established in the laboratory to observe the effects of the antiretroviral drug-induced bottleneck on the integrase and env genes. env diversity was decreased significantly in one primary isolate [kp-1, harbouring both cxcr4 (x4)- and ccr5 (r5)-tropic variants] when passaged in the presence or absence of raltegravir (ral) during in vitro selection. furthermore, the ral-selected kp-1 variant had a completely different env sequence from that in the passage control (particularly evident in the gp120, v1/v2 and v4-loop regions), and a different number of potential n-glycosylation sites. a similar pattern was also observed in other primary isolates when using different classes of drugs. this is the first study to explore the influence of anti-hiv drugs on bottlenecks in bulk primary hiv isolates with highly diverse env sequences using in vitro selection.  it has been reported that the addition of a potential n-linked glycosylation site (pngs) to the gp120 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) envelope glycoprotein provides protection against neutralizing antibodies (nabs) by acting as a 'glycan shield'. in this study, we induced insertion of a pngs into the v2 region of hiv-1(bal) with the kd-247 anti-v3 neutralizing monoclonal antibody. in the presence of kd-247 (200 microg ml(-1)) at passage five, viruses with 3 aa mutations in the c2 (t240s and i283t) and v3 (t319a) regions expanded from pre-existing variants. after six passages with kd-247 (>300 microg ml(-1)), a pngs emerged in the v2 region in addition to c2 (t240s) and v3 mutations (r315k and f317l). a variant with a pngs insertion in v2, but no v3 mutations was sensitive to kd-247, whereas a clone with a v2 pngs insertion and mutations in v3 demonstrated a high level of resistance to kd-247. replication kinetic analysis revealed that the f317l mutation in v3 played a compensatory role for fitness-loss caused by the pngs insertion in v2. the evading hiv-1 variant did not revert back to the wild-type virus after 14 passages without kd-247. these findings demonstrate that the virus with fitness-loss mutations can replicate equally as well as the wild-type virus to acquire some key mutations in the v3 stem and the c2 region, and the compensated variants containing pngs do not revert back to the ancestral virus even in the absence of nab.
repeat unit length variation and internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences of nuclear ribosomal dna were used to assess genetic diversity, and phylogenetic relationships in chickpea (c. arietinum) cultivars, and its related wild species. total genomic dnas of 76 accessions of 10 cicer species, belonging to three sections of the genus, were restricted with seven enzymes and the restriction fragments were hybridized to heterologous ribosomal clones of wheat pta71 and vicia faba probes ver 6-5 and ver18-6. a single repeat unit length class of 11.4 kb or 10.5 kb was recognized across cicer accessions with pta71. the intraspecific variation was negligible in those species where more than one accession was studied, except the four c. judaicum accessions, which were different from the rest. ecori and drai digests gave two and one-two fragments, respectively. all the accessions produced three and three-five bands with bamhi and saci, respectively. both the accessions of c. yamashitae differed in their rdna repeat unit length as well as restriction site variation. maximum likelihood tree with rdna rflp recognized five clades which were more or less congruent with the previous data. length of its-1 region was more variable (235–239 bp) than the its-2 region (212–213 bp). cladistic analysis of its data revealed two major clades, clade i consisting of c. arietinum, c. reticulatum and c. echinospermum, and clade ii comprised of c. judaicum, c. chorassanicum, c. bijugum and c. cuneatum. c. microphyllum grouped with the above four species. c. pinnatifidum was present as a separate branch. c. yamashitae emerged as the most distinct species.  molecular phylogeny based on internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences was studied to resolve the taxonomic contradiction in vigna and its relation to phaseolus. the its region of the 18s-26s nuclear ribosomal dna repeat was sequenced for 29 vigna species, selected from five of the nine subgenera, and 9 species of phaseolus. the length of its-1 ranged from 187 to 243 bp and 217 to 290 bp, and that of its-2 from 187 to 219 bp and 225 to 243 bp, within vigna and phaseolus species, respectively. phylogenies derived from its sequences based on maximum-parsimony and neighbor-joining methods gave trees essentially of similar topology. the its phylogeny was generally congruent with recent classifications based largely on morphological, biochemical, cytogenetical, and palynological features, except that subgenus plectotropis of neotropical origin was revealed to be closely related to subgenus vigna instead of forming a link between african (subgenus vigna) and asiatic (subgenus ceratotropis) vignas, and subgenus sigmoidotropis, featuring morphological characters of both vigna and phaseolus, was placed as the sister group to the phaseolus taxa. the its sequences were shown to be useful for identifying wild progenitors of v. mungo, v. radiata, v. umbellata, and v. unguiculata and for clarifying taxonomy-related problems in many previously controversial cases. this study also affirms that v. umbellata and v. angularis are the diploid progenitors of the only tetraploid species (v. glabrescens) known in the genus.
we applied an extensive data set from 211 locations along austrian rivers to assess community structure and the ratios of functional feeding groups of benthic macroinvertebrates. a total of 569 taxa have been identified. at the catchment scale, the enns, salzach, and traun rivers exhibited the highest taxa richness whereas the inn river showed the lowest richness. beta-diversity was highest along the impounded and fragmented enns and drau rivers. consequently, high corridor diversity corresponded to a low degree of nestedness. overall, scrapers and gathering-collectors dominated the benthic community. further, the relationship between habitat conditions and metrics based on functional feeding groups were statistically analyzed to validate the potential of these metrics as indicators of ecosystem attributes. we examined four major ecosystem attributes: species diversity, material cycling, longitudinal material transport, and lateral material input. multiple regression analyses for midorder rivers demonstrated that metrics were significantly related to habitat conditions. for example, the metric set indicating primary production was positively correlated with periphyton cover, dissolved oxygen, dominant sediment size, and average annual discharge. overall, most metrics exhibited unique responses to habitat conditions, implying that they are useful proxies of ecosystem attributes. thus, a function-based approach based on macroinvertebrates has the potential to become an effective tool for the assessment of river ecosystems.  an exact expression is given for the jackknife estimate of the number of species in a community and for the variance of this number when quadrat sampling procedures are used. the jackknife estimate is a function of the number of species that occur in one and only one quadrat. the variance of the number of species can be constructed, as can approximate two-sided confidence intervals. the behavior of the jackknife estimate, as affected by quadrat size, sample size and sampling area, is investigated by simulation.
developing seeds are expected to be strongly defended against microbial attack. in keeping with this, only 26% of seeds of centaurea stoebe from its native and invaded ranges in eurasia and north america were infected with fungi, and 92.2% of those were infected with a single fungus per seed. even when developing seeds in flower heads were inoculated under conducive conditions for infection with 14 of these seed-infecting fungi, re-isolation of inoculants was only 16% overall, and again limited to the particular inoculant. environmental fungi (i.e. those not isolated from seed of c. stoebe) were present in control flower heads under conditions conducive to infection but they were never re-isolated from fully developed seeds in any experiments. when two or three seed isolates were co-inoculated to compete in flower heads, only one inoculant, and always the same one, was re-isolated from all matured seeds, regardless of maternal plant genotype. pcr-based detection methods confirmed that these fungal interactions were exclusionary rather than suppressive. in these strongly defended, developing seeds, we had expected the plant to control not only the overall level of infection but also the outcome of co-inoculations. consequences for the next plant generation of this exclusionary competition among seed-infecting fungi included effects on seedling emergence, growth and fecundity.  fungal endophytes are important in plant ecology and common in plants. we attempted to test cointroduction and host-jumping hypotheses on a community basis by comparing endophytes isolated from invasive spotted knapweed (centaurea stoebe, asteraceae) in its native and invaded ranges. of 92 combined, sequence-based haplotypes representing eight classes of fungi, 78 occurred in only one of the two ranges. in the native range of c. stoebe, one haplotype of alternaria alternata was clearly dominant, whereas in the invaded range, no haplotype was dominant. many haplotypes were closely related to one another and novel. for example, six putative, new species of botrytis were discovered as endophytes of c. stoebe, which has never been reported to have botrytis spp.. apparent differences between the two communities of endophytes were significant according to an analysis of similarity, but phylogenetic community structure did not differ significantly between the ranges. both host-jumping and cointroduction of fungal endophytes likely took place during the spotted knapweed invasion.
introduction:  targeted intrathecal drug infusion to treat moderate to severe chronic pain has become a standard part of treatment algorithms when more conservative options fail. this therapy is well established in the literature, has shown efficacy, and is an important tool for the treatment of both cancer and noncancer pain; however, it has become clear in recent years that intrathecal drug delivery is associated with risks for serious morbidity and mortality.  objectives:the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intrathecal narcotics pump (itnp) as an alternative treatment for patients with pain from chronic pancreatitis (cp). itnp offers the advantages of reversibility, lower total narcotic dose, and the pancreas remaining intact.methods:thirteen patients (8 female, 5 male), with mean age 40.6 years (s.d. 9.6 years), who had experienced intractable upper abdominal pain from cp were reviewed. each patient had multiple other failed treatment modalities, including partial pancreatic resection (n=6). they were offered itnp after a successful intraspinal opioid trial. etiologies of cp included idiopathy (n=3), cystic fibrosis (n=2), alcohol (n=2), and pancreas divisum (n=6).results:the median duration of severe, intractable pain prior to itnp was 6 years (2–22 years). the median follow-up time after itnp was 29 months (range, 7–94 months). the itnp was in situ for a mean duration of 29 months (range, 0.5–94 months). seven patients had pump exchange or removal for various reasons; improvement of pain at month 53 (n=1), meningitis (n=1), meningitis with subsequent replacement (n=1), pump failure at month 31, 68, 79, and 84 (n=4). there were no deaths. the mean pain score prior to implantation (score=8.3, s.d.=0.9) was significantly higher than 1 year after (score=2.7, s.d.=1.9) (p<0.01) and last follow-up (score=0.75, s.d.=2.1) (p<0.01). the median oral narcotic dose before and 1 year after itnp were morphine sulfate equivalents 337.5 mg per day (range, 67.5–1,320) and 40 mg per day (range, 0–1,680), respectively (p<0.01). two patients were considered failures, as they still require a high dosage of both oral and intrathecal medications to control their pain, despite significant pain-score improvement. one patient who was excluded due to meningitis was also considered a failure. therefore, the overall success rate of itnp based on an intention-to-treat analysis was 76.9% (10/13). the major complications of itnp were central nervous system infection requiring pump removal (n=1), cerebrospinal fluid leak requiring laminectomy (n=1), and perispinal abscess with bacterial meningitis requiring pump removal (n=1).conclusions:this study shows the many risks and benefits of itnp. a longer follow-up is awaited; such pumps appear to be one alternative to aggressive surgical intervention. failed itnp trials leave other options open. therapeutic trials directly comparing pancreatectomy, itnp, and implanted nerve stimulators are of interest.
the ability to use information about the uncertainty of future outcomes is critical for adaptive behavior in an uncertain world. we show that the basal forebrain (bf) contains at least two distinct neural-coding strategies to support this capacity. the dorsal-lateral bf, including the ventral pallidum (vp), contains reward-sensitive neurons, some of which are selectively suppressed by uncertain-reward predictions (u−). in contrast, the medial bf (mbf) contains reward-sensitive neurons, some of which are selectively enhanced (u+) by uncertain-reward predictions. in a two-alternative choice-task, u− neurons were selectively suppressed while monkeys chose uncertain options over certain options. during the same choice-epoch, u+ neurons signaled the subjective reward value of the choice options. additionally, after the choice was reported, u+ neurons signaled reward uncertainty until the choice outcome. we suggest that uncertainty-related suppression of vp may participate in the mediation of uncertainty-seeking actions, whereas uncertainty-related enhancement of the mbf may direct cognitive resources to monitor and learn from uncertain-outcomes. significance statement to survive in an uncertain world, we must approach uncertainty and learn from it. here we provide evidence for two mostly distinct mechanisms for processing uncertainty about rewards within different subregions of the primate basal forebrain (bf). we found that uncertainty suppressed the representation of certain (or safe) reward values by some neurons in the dorsal-lateral bf, in regions occupied by the ventral pallidum. this uncertainty-related suppression was evident as monkeys made risky choices. we also found that uncertainty-enhanced the activity of many medial bf neurons, most prominently after the monkeys' choices were completed (as they awaited uncertain outcomes). based on these findings, we propose that different subregions of the bf could support action and learning under uncertainty in distinct but complimentary manners.  it has been suggested that the basal forebrain (bf) exerts strong influences on the formation of memory and behavior. however, what information is used for the memory-behavior formation is unclear. we found that a population of neurons in the medial bf (medial septum and diagonal band of broca) of macaque monkeys encodes a unique combination of information: reward uncertainty, expected reward value, anticipation of punishment, and unexpected reward and punishment. the results were obtained while the monkeys were expecting (often with uncertainty) a rewarding or punishing outcome during a pavlovian procedure, or unexpectedly received an outcome outside the procedure. in vivo anterograde tracing using manganese-enhanced mri suggested that the major recipient of these signals is the intermediate hippocampal formation. based on these findings, we hypothesize that the medial bf identifies various contexts and outcomes that are critical for memory processing in the hippocampal formation.
purpose:castration therapy adjuvant to radiotherapy can significantly improve overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. although many of the adverse effects of castration therapy are manageable, they can have a detrimental effect on quality of life. here we evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the non-castration-based therapy bicalutamide (‘casodex’) 150 mg adjuvant to radiotherapy in patients with t1-4, m0, any n prostate cancer.methods:the subset of patients within the early prostate cancer (epc) program who received radiotherapy with curative intent (n = 1,370) were included in the analysis. these patients were randomized to receive oral bicalutamide 150 mg once daily (n = 699) or placebo (n = 671).results:the median follow-up for patients included in this analysis was 7.2 years. in patients with locally advanced disease (n = 305), bicalutamide adjuvant to radiotherapy significantly improved: progression-free survival (pfs), reducing the risk of objective progression by 44% compared with radiotherapy alone [hazard ratio (hr) 0.56; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.40, 0.78; p < 0.001). prostate-specific antigen (psa)–pfs, reducing the risk of psa progression by 59% compared with radiotherapy alone (hr 0.41; 95% ci 0.30, 0.55; p < 0.001). overall survival, reducing the risk of death by 35% compared with radiotherapy alone (hr 0.65; 95% ci 0.44, 0.95; p = 0.03). this significant overall survival benefit for bicalutamide was driven by a lower risk of prostate cancer-related deaths (16.1 vs 24.3%, respectively). there was no significant difference in pfs or overall survival in patients with localized disease (n = 1,065).conclusions:in patients with locally advanced disease, bicalutamide 150 mg adjuvant to radiotherapy demonstrates significant clinical benefits in terms of overall survival, pfs and psa–pfs compared with radiotherapy alone. the overall survival benefit in these patients is consistent with prior studies evaluating castration-based therapies adjuvant to radiotherapy (bolla et al. in lancet 360:103–108, 2002; pilepich et al. in int j radiat oncol biol phys 61:1285–1290, 2005). in addition, the clinical benefit of bicalutamide 150 mg in locally advanced patients, but not in those with localized disease, is consistent with the overall results from the epc program (mcleod et al. bju int 97:247–254, 2006). given the quality-of-life advantages of bicalutamide relative to castration, bicalutamide 150 mg adjuvant to radiotherapy is an attractive alternative for men with locally advanced prostate cancer.  to evaluate, in the ongoing early prostate cancer (epc) trial programme, the efficacy and tolerability of bicalutamide 150 mg once daily in addition to standard care for localized or locally advanced, nonmetastatic prostate cancer.
the optimal number of offspring for males and females may differ, as males and females invest differently in different aspects of reproduction. this creates potential for a sexual conflict leading to reduced residual reproductive value of the sex that experiences exploitation by the other sex. we experimentally investigated (by changing the brood size by one offspring) the effects of increased or decreased parental effort on the future local survival and breeding success of adult pied flycatchers (ficedula hypoleuca), and on the future expression of male ornamentation. in addition, we studied how experimentally changing the brood size affected offspring condition and their recruitment. we show that females (but not males) rearing enlarged broods had lower local survival compared to those rearing reduced or control broods. this indicates a sexual conflict concerning optimal brood size. however, even though brood size manipulation did not affect the local survival of males, it did have an influence on the dorsal melanin coloration of young males. young males rearing enlarged broods showed a stronger increase in plumage darkness from the current to the next breeding season than those rearing reduced or control broods. this suggests that stress experienced during reproduction might have carry-over effects that influence the complicated melanocortin system and lead to changes in the expression of melanin-based coloration. alternatively, successful breeding might have stimulated young males to further invest in reproduction in the following season. taken together these results indicate that both sexes are affected by brood demands, but in different ways.  a fundamental premise of life‐history theory is that organisms that increase current reproductive investment suffer increased mortality. possibly the most studied life‐history phenotypic relationship is the trade‐off between parental effort and survival. however, evidence supporting this trade‐off is equivocal. here, we conducted a meta‐analysis to test the generality of this tenet. using experimental studies that manipulated parental effort in birds, we show that (i) the effect of parental effort on survival was similar across species regardless of phylogeny; (ii) individuals that experienced reduced parental effort had similar survival probabilities than control individuals, regardless of sex; and (iii) males that experienced increased parental effort were less likely to survive than control males, whereas females that experienced increased effort were just as likely to survive as control females. our results suggest that the trade‐off between parental effort and survival is more complex than previously assumed. finally, our study provides recommendations of unexplored avenues of future research into life‐history trade‐offs.
worldwide more than 400 plant species are now known that hyperaccumulate various trace metals (cd, co, cu, mn, ni, and zn), metalloids (as) and nonmetals (se) in their shoots. of these, almost one-quarter are brassicaceae family members, including numerous thlaspi species that hyperaccumulate ni up to 3% of there shoot dry weight. we observed that concentrations of glutathione, cys, and o-acetyl-l-serine (oas), in shoot tissue, are strongly correlated with the ability to hyperaccumulate ni in various thlaspi hyperaccumulators collected from serpentine soils, including thlaspi goesingense, t. oxyceras, and t. rosulare, and nonaccumulator relatives, including t. perfoliatum, t. arvense, and arabidopsis thaliana. further analysis of the austrian ni hyperaccumulator t. goesingense revealed that the high concentrations of oas, cys, and gsh observed in this hyperaccumulator coincide with constitutively high activity of both serine acetyltransferase (sat) and glutathione reductase. sat catalyzes the acetylation of l-ser to produce oas, which acts as both a key positive regulator of sulfur assimilation and forms the carbon skeleton for cys biosynthesis. these changes in cys and gsh metabolism also coincide with the ability of t. goesingense to both hyperaccumulate ni and resist its damaging oxidative effects. overproduction of t. goesingense sat in the nonaccumulator brassicaceae family member arabidopsis was found to cause accumulation of oas, cys, and glutathione, mimicking the biochemical changes observed in the ni hyperaccumulators. in these transgenic arabidopsis, glutathione concentrations strongly correlate with increased resistance to both the growth inhibitory and oxidative stress induced effects of ni. taken together, such evidence supports our conclusion that elevated gsh concentrations, driven by constitutively elevated sat activity, are involved in conferring tolerance to ni-induced oxidative stress in thlaspi ni hyperaccumulators.  copper tolerance among arabidopsis ecotypes is inversely correlated with long-term k(+) leakage and positively correlated with short-term k(+) leakage (a. murphy, l. taiz [1997] new phytol 136: 211-222). to probe the mechanism of the early phase of k(+) efflux, we tested various channel blockers on copper and peroxide-induced k(+) efflux from seedling roots. the k(+) channel blockers tetraethyl ammonium chloride and 4-aminopyridine (4-ap) both inhibited short-term copper-induced k(+) efflux. in contrast, peroxide-induced k(+) efflux was insensitive to both tetraethyl ammonium chloride and 4-ap. copper-induced lipid peroxidation exhibited a lag time of 4 h, while peroxide-induced lipid peroxidation began immediately. these results suggest that short-term copper-induced k(+) efflux is mediated by channels, while peroxide-induced k(+) efflux represents leakage through nonspecific lesions in the lipid bilayer. tracer studies with (86)rb(+) confirmed that copper promotes k(+) efflux rather than inhibiting k(+) uptake. short-term k(+) release is electroneutral, since electrophysiological measurements indicated that copper does not cause membrane depolarization. short-term k(+) efflux was accompanied by citrate release, and copper increased total citrate levels. since citrate efflux was blocked by 4-ap, k(+) appears to serve as a counterion during copper-induced citrate efflux. as copper but not aluminum selectively induces citrate production and release, it is proposed that copper may inhibit a cytosolic form of aconitase.
supervised machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with learning computer programs to automatically improve with experience through knowledge extraction from examples. it builds predictive models from labeled data. such learning approaches are useful for many interesting real-world applications, but are particularly useful for tasks involving the automatic categorization, retrieval and extraction of knowledge from large collections of data such as text, images and videos. in traditional supervised learning, one uses ”labeled” data to build a model. however, labeling the training data for real-world applications is difficult, expensive, or time consuming, as it requires the effort of human annotators sometimes with specific domain experience and training. there are implicit costs associated with obtaining these labels from domain experts, such as limited time and financial resources. this is especially true for applications that involve learning with large number of class labels and sometimes with similarities among them. semi-supervised learning (ssl) addresses this inherent bottleneck by allowing the model to integrate part or all of the available unlabeled data in its supervised learning. the goal is to maximize the learning performance of the model through such newly-labeled examples while minimizing the work required of human annotators. exploiting unlabeled data to help improve the learning performance has become a hot topic during the last decade and it is divided into four main directions: ssl with graphs, ssl with generative models, semi-supervised support vector machines and ssl by disagreement (ssl with committees). it is interesting to see that semi-supervised learning and ensemble learning are two important paradigms that were developed almost in parallel and with different philosophies. semi-supervised learning tries to improve generalization performance by exploiting unlabeled data, while ensemble learning tries to achieve the same objective by using multiple predictors. in this thesis, i concentrate on ssl by disagreement and especially on cotraining style algorithms. co-training is a popular ssl algorithm introduced by  this paper shows that the accuracy of learned text classifiers can be improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training documents with a large pool of unlabeled documents. this is important because in many text classification problems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available.we introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of expectation-maximization (em) and a naive bayes classifier. the algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. it then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. this basic em procedure works well when the data conform to the generative assumptions of the model. however these assumptions are often violated in practice, and poor performance can result. we present two extensions to the algorithm that improve classification accuracy under these conditions: (1) a weighting factor to modulate the contribution of the unlabeled data, and (2) the use of multiple mixture components per class. experimental results, obtained using text from three different real-world tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification error by up to 30%.
we present an approach to feature weight optimization for document-level decoding. this is an essential task for enabling future development of discourse-level statistical machine translation, as it allows easy integration of discourse features in the decoding process. we extend the framework of sentence-level feature weight optimization to the document-level. we show experimentally that we can get competitive and relatively stable results when using a standard set of features, and that this framework also allows us to optimize documentlevel features, which can be used to model discourse phenomena.  we collected a corpus of parallel text in 11 languages from the proceedings of the european parliament, which are published on the web1. this corpus has found widespread use in the nlp community. here, we focus on its acquisition and its application as training data for statistical machine translation (smt). we trained smt systems for 110 language pairs, which reveal interesting clues into the challenges ahead.
non-enzymatic glycation of peripheral nerve extracellular matrix (ecm) may contribute to the development of diabetic distal sensory neuropathy (dnp). we investigated the relative importance of glycation of collagen types i and iv, laminin and fibronectin in dnp-related impairment in peripheral nerve regeneration. dorsal root ganglia (drgs) from young adult mice were embedded in collagen type i modified by 10% substitution with normal or glycated forms of the proteins and incubated for 3 days. outgrowth of axons and migration of cells into the ecm were quantified. mean length of growing axons was significantly reduced by glycation of laminin and collagen type iv. the sum of lengths of all axons from each drg was greatly reduced with glycated laminin, collagen types iv and i. glycation of fibronectin had no effect on axonal growth. the number of migrating cells was not affected by glycation. we conclude that non-enzymatic glycation of laminin and collagen types iv and i (in decreasing order) impairs peripheral nerve regeneration in vitro.  abstract the pattern of collagenisation in peripheral nerve in diabetic polyneuropathy was examined in nerve biopsy specimens from patients with diabetic polyneuropathy in comparison with organ donor control nerves and disease controls (other neuropathies). there was increased endoneurial collagenisation both in the diabetic polyneuropathy cases and the disease controls, this predominantly involving types i and iii. type ii collagen was not detected in organ donor control nerves or in the diabetic and the disease control nerves. there was a relative increase in type vi collagen in the endoneurium in the diabetic nerves immediately surrounding groups of schwann cells. this was not a feature in the other neuropathies. the quantity of types iv, v and vi collagen was increased around the endoneurial microvessels in the diabetic patients and, to a lesser extent, in those with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (hmsn). increased deposition of types iv and v collagen was observed in the perineurium in the diabetic nerves, the latter being most evident in the innermost lamellae where the amount of laminin was possibly also increased. the diameter of the general endoneurial collagen fibrils was greater in the diabetic nerves, although this was not more than in a disease control (hmsn). the collagen fibrils that were present within the basal laminal tubes that had surrounded degenerated myelinated fibres in the diabetic nerves, and those within the onion bulbs of the hmsn cases, were of the normal endoneurial calibre. the expression of laminin by büngner bands in diabetic neuropathy did not differ from that in disease control nerves, nor were any differences detected for fibronectin. whether the changes observed are important for the impaired regenerative capacity in diabetic neuropathy requires further investigation.
the social environment has potent effects on individual phenotype and fitness in group-living species. we asked whether the presence of kin might act on energy allocation, a central aspect of life-history variation. using a 22-year data set on reproductive and somatic allocations in columbian ground squirrels (urocitellus columbianus), we tested the effects of co-breeding and non-breeding kin on the fitness and energy allocation balance between reproduction and personal body condition of individual females. greater numbers of co-breeding kin had a positive effect on the number of offspring weaned, through the mechanism of altering energy allocation patterns. on average, females with higher numbers of co-breeding kin did not increase energy income but biased energy allocation towards reproduction. co-breeding female kin ground squirrels maintain close nest burrows, likely providing a social buffer against territorial invasions from non-kin ground squirrels. lower aggressiveness, lower risks of infanticide from female kin and greater protection of territorial boundaries may allow individual females to derive net fitness benefits via their energy allocation strategies. we demonstrated the importance of kin effects on a fundamental life-history trade-off.  since w. d. hamilton's seminal work on the evolution of sociality, a large body of research has accumulated on how kin selection might explain the evolution of cooperation in many group-living species. our study examined the evolutionary basis of philopatry and cooperation; specifically, whether individuals benefit from the presence of close kin. we applied an individual fitness approach to a 16-year study of columbian ground squirrels (urocitellus columbianus) to investigate potential causal paths by which the presence of kin might act on individual fitness. our results indicate that individual fitness benefits resulted from associations of philopatric female kin, and support the hypothesis that increased tolerance of proximity of kin is a proximate mechanism for these benefits. the major life-history influence of kin on individual fitness was through improved reproductive success, and this benefit may have been owing to philopatric settlement of kin that were recognized through familiarization in the natal burrow. thus, we demonstrated an evolutionary basis necessary for ongoing kin-selected cooperation in columbian ground squirrels, though the mechanism of familiarity may determine which kin individuals benefit from cooperative behaviours.
alpha-synuclein gene (snca) polymorphisms have been associated with the common sporadic form of parkinson’s disease (pd). we searched for dna variants at the snca 3′ utr through single strand conformation analysis and direct sequencing in a cohort of spanish pd patients and controls. we have genotyped the rs356165 snca 3′ utr polymorphism in a total of 1,135 pd patients and 772 healthy controls from two spanish cohorts (asturias and navarre). we identified six snca 3′ utr variants. single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) rs356165 was significantly associated with pd risk in the spanish cohort (p = 0.0001; odd ratio = 1.37, 95%ci = 1.19–1.58). this snp was also significantly associated with early age at onset of pd. our work highlights rs356165 as an important determinant of the risk of developing pd and early age at onset and encourages future research to identify a functional effect on snca expression.  few detailed clinico-pathological correlations of parkinson's disease have been published. the pathological findings in 100 patients diagnosed prospectively by a group of consultant neurologists as having idiopathic parkinson's disease are reported. seventy six had nigral lewy bodies, and in all of these lewy bodies were also found in the cerebral cortex. in 24 cases without lewy bodies, diagnoses included progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, alzheimer's disease, alzheimer-type pathology, and basal ganglia vascular disease. the retrospective application of recommended diagnostic criteria improved the diagnostic accuracy to 82%. these observations call into question current concepts of parkinson's disease as a single distinct morbid entity.
background their large scaffold diversity and properties, such as structural complexity and drug similarity, form the basis of claims that natural products are ideal starting points for drug design and development. consequently, there has been great interest in determining whether such molecules show biological activity toward protein targets of pharmacological relevance. one target of particular interest is hikk-2, a serine-threonine protein kinase belonging to the ikk complex that is the primary component responsible for activating nf-κb in response to various inflammatory stimuli. indeed, this has led to the development of synthetic atp-competitive inhibitors for hikk-2. therefore, the main goals of this study were (a) to use virtual screening to identify potential hikk-2 inhibitors of natural origin that compete with atp and (b) to evaluate the reliability of our virtual-screening protocol by experimentally testing the in vitro activity of selected natural-product hits. methodology/principal findings we thus predicted that 1,061 out of the 89,425 natural products present in the studied database would inhibit hikk-2 with good admet properties. notably, when these 1,061 molecules were merged with the 98 synthetic hikk-2 inhibitors used in this study and the resulting set was classified into ten clusters according to chemical similarity, there were three clusters that contained only natural products. five molecules from these three clusters (for which no anti-inflammatory activity has been previously described) were then selected for in vitro activity testing, in which three out of the five molecules were shown to inhibit hikk-2. conclusions/significance we demonstrated that our virtual-screening protocol was successful in identifying lead compounds for developing new inhibitors for hikk-2, a target of great interest in medicinal chemistry. additionally, all the tools developed during the current study (i.e., the homology model for the hikk-2 kinase domain and the pharmacophore) will be made available to interested readers upon request.  we have recently identified bms-345541 (1) as a highly selective and potent inhibitor of ikk-2 (ic50 = 0.30 microm), which however was considerably less potent against ikk-1 (ic50 = 4.0 microm). in order to further explore the sar around the imidazoquinoxaline tricyclic structure of 1, we prepared a series of tetracyclic analogues (7, 13, and 18). the synthesis and biological activities of these potent ikk inhibitors are described.
we develop a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms a la melitz (2003), where both the government and firms can invest into r&d to improve the country's technological potential. a higher technological potential raises the average productivity of firms, thus implying lower consumer prices, and eventually leads to a welfare gain. the government's public and firms' private investments are modelled in a three-stage game, in which the government in the first stage invests into a basic research level, and then firms conduct private r&d building on this publicly provided 'technology' in the second stage. we find that private r&d investments are hump-shaped with respect to the basic research level. for lower levels public and private investments are complements, while for higher levels they are substitutes.  economic interest in innovation policy largely arises from the fundamental importance of innovation to social welfare and from inefficiencies in innovation in a competitive market environment. as a result, a wide variety of public innovation policies are used in practice. this study reviews the economic justifications for public innovation policies and compares the existing policy tools, paying particular attention to the finnish innovation policy environment.
chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (cr-eae) was induced in lewis rats by inoculation with guinea pig spinal cord and adjuvants and treatment with low dose cyclosporin a (csa). acute eae was induced by the same method without csa treatment. immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry were used to assess inflammatory cells and mhc class ii (ia) antigen expression in the central nervous system of these rats. the inflammatory infiltrate was composed mainly of cd4+ t cells and macrophages, and alpha beta t cells constituted about 65% of the cd2+ t cells. after recovery from acute eae and during the first remission of cr-eae, the number of t cells was significantly less than in the preceding episodes. the number of t cells was higher in the second episode of cr-eae than in the first remission. throughout the course of cr-eae, the majority of the cd2+ t cells were cd45rc-. the ratio of il-2r+ cells to cd2+ cells ranged from 10.5 to 24.0%. the ratio of cd4+ t cells to b cells was lower in the later episodes of cr-eae than in the first episode. ia antigen was expressed on infiltrating round cells at all stages of cr-eae and on microglial cells (identified by dendritic morphology) with increasing intensity throughout the course of cr-eae. with flow cytometry, the number of ia+ cells obtained from the spinal cord rose throughout the course of cr-eae. the number of fsclowox1low cells, which we consider represent microglia, also increased during the course of cr-eae.  in addition to the major population of infiltrating leukocytes recovered from inflamed rat central nervous system (cns), all of which expressed high levels of leukocyte common antigen cd45, many cells were coisolated that were mrc ox42+ (complement receptor 3/cd11b) but expressed low-to-moderate levels of cd45 and major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i molecules. most cells from normal cns, in contrast, lay within this latter, cd45low population. from previous in situ immunohistochemical studies, the fortuitously isolated cd45low cells were probably resident (ramified) microglia. using irradiation chimeras, we show that resident microglia respond to inflammation by upregulating cd45, cd4, and mhc class i molecules with a minority of these cells increasing their expression of mhc class ii molecules. a 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of microglia isolated from inflamed cns provided indirect evidence that the cells had proliferated. in normal cns, a very small population of blood-derived cd45high-expressing cells are present; most mhc class ii expression is associated with these few cells and not with the resident microglia.
previous confirmatory factor analytic research that has examined the factor structure of the wechsler adult intelligence scale–fourth edition (wais-iv) has endorsed either higher order models or oblique factor models that tend to amalgamate both general factor and index factor sources of systematic variance. an alternative model that has not yet been examined for the wais-iv is the bifactor model. bifactor models allow all subtests to load onto both the general factor and their respective index factor directly. bifactor models are also particularly amenable to the estimation of model-based reliabilities for both global composite scores (ω h ) and subscale/index scores (ω s ). based on the wais-iv normative sample correlation matrices, a bifactor model that did not include any index factor cross loadings or correlated residuals was found to be better fitting than the conventional higher order and oblique factor models. although the ω h estimate associated with the full scale intelligence quotient (fsiq) scores was respectably high (.86), the ω s estimates associated with the wais-iv index scores were very low (.13 to .47). the results are interpreted in the context of the benefits of a bifactor modeling approach. additionally, in light of the very low levels of unique internal consistency reliabilities associated with the index scores, it is contended that clinical index score interpretations are probably not justifiable.  the present study examined the factor structure of the wechsler adult intelligence scale--fourth edition (wais-iv; d. wechsler, 2008a) standardization sample using exploratory factor analysis, multiple factor extraction criteria, and higher order exploratory factor analysis (j. schmid & j. m. leiman, 1957) not included in the wais-iv technical and interpretation manual (d. wechsler, 2008b). results indicated that the wais-iv subtests were properly associated with the theoretically proposed first-order factors, but all but one factor-extraction criterion recommended extraction of one or two factors. hierarchical exploratory analyses with the schmid and leiman procedure found that the second-order g factor accounted for large portions of total and common variance, whereas the four first-order factors accounted for small portions of total and common variance. it was concluded that the wais-iv provides strong measurement of general intelligence, and clinical interpretation should be primarily at that level.
in this paper, we addressed the named entity recognition (ner) problem for morphologically rich languages by employing a semi-supervised learning approach based on neural networks. we adopted a fast unsupervised method for learning continuous vector representations of words, and used these representations along with language independent features to develop a ner system. we evaluated our system for the highly inflectional turkish and czech languages. we improved the state-of-the-art f-score obtained for turkish without using gazetteers by 2.26% and for czech by 1.53%. unlike the previous state-of-the-art systems developed for these languages, our system does not make use of any language dependent features. therefore, we believe it can easily be applied to other morphologically rich languages.  in this paper, we present our effort to consolidate and push further the named entity recognition (ner) research for the czech language. the research in czech is based upon a non-standard basis. some systems are constructed to provide hierarchical outputs whereas the rests give flat entities. direct comparison among these system is therefore impossible. our first goal is to tackle this issue. we build our own ner system based upon conditional random fields (crf) model. it is constructed to output either flat or hierarchical named entities thus enabling an evaluation with all the known systems for czech language. we show a 3.5 – 11% absolute performance increase when compared to previously published results. as a last step we put our system in the context of the research for other languages. we show results for english, spanish and dutch corpora. we can conclude that our system provides solid results when compared to the foreign state of the art.
background human defensin (hd) 5 and hd6, both paneth cell alpha-defensins, contribute to the antimicrobial barrier against intestinal infection. we have previously demonstrated that levels of both hd5 and hd6 mrna were reduced in adults living in urban zambia, compared with those in adults living in london. the aim of the present study was to determine, during 2 years of follow-up, whether alpha-defensin expression in zambian adults is related to susceptibility to diarrhea.   methods we analyzed intestinal biopsy samples from a longitudinal cohort study conducted in 83 zambian adults by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization, and we measured the incidence of diarrhea.   results levels of hd5 and hd6 mrna in paneth cells varied between participants, over time, and seasonally and were strongly correlated with mucosal architecture. gene expression was almost exclusively restricted to paneth cells. the median (interquartile range) hd5 mrna level was 6.0 (5.6-6.7) log10 transcripts/microg of total rna among 18 participants who experienced diarrhea within 2 months after biopsy-sample collection, compared with 6.8 (6.2-7.3) log10 transcripts/microg of total rna among 94 participants who did not (p=.006). a similar observation was made for hd6.   conclusions these data indicate that intestinal alpha-defensin expression is dynamic and seasonal and suggest that susceptibility to intestinal infection is related to alpha-defensin expression.  to determine the response of the small intestinal mucosa to environmental conditions, we studied changes in mucosal architecture and function in a longitudinal cohort study in african adults. over three consecutive years, 238 adults submitted monthly stool samples for parasitologic and bacteriologic analysis and underwent an annual endoscopic jejunal biopsy for mucosal morphometry. absorption and permeability assays were performed on the same day as the enteroscopy. variation in mucosal architecture and function was correlated with environmental factors and stool microbiology. the whole cohort had structural and functional evidence of tropical enteropathy, but structure and function were only weakly correlated. there were marked changes over time, and seasonal variation was observed in villous height (16%), xylose recovery (16%), and permeability (28%). asymptomatic intestinal infections were common. enteropathy was more severe in participants with citrobacter rodentium or hookworm ova in the stool sample taken one month before the investigations were performed.
the enormous services obtainable by bank and postal systems are not 100 % guaranteed due to variability of handwriting styles. various methods based on neural networks have been suggested to address this issue. unfortunately, they often fall into local optima that arises from the use of old learning methods. global optimization methods provided new directions for neural networks evolution that may be useful in recognition. this paper develops efficient algorithms that compute globally optimal solutions by exploiting the benefits of both swarm intelligence and neuro-evolution in a way to improve the overall performance of a character recognition system. various adaptations implied to both mlp and rbf networks have been suggested namely: particle swarm optimization (pso) and the bees algorithm (ba) for characters classification, mlp training or rbf design by co-evolution and effective combinations of mlps, rbfs or svms as an attempt to overcome the drawbacks of old recognition methods. results proved that networks combination proposals ensure the highest improvement compared to either standard mlp and rbf networks, the co-evolutionary alternatives or other classifiers combination based on common combination rules namely majority voting, the fusion rules of min, max, sum, average, product and bayes, decision template and the behavior knowledge space (bks).  in this paper, we analyze the performance of a classifier ensemble consisting of small-sized neural networks for accurate and fast learning. to this end, three topologies of neural networks are evaluated: the multilayer perceptron with two different configurations in the hidden layer, and the modular neural network. the experiments here carried out illustrate the effectiveness of the ensembles of neural networks in terms of average predictive accuracy and processing time, as compared to the single classifiers.
purpose to explore the effects of light exposure and deprivation on the distribution and function of microglia in the subretinal space of mice.   methods using a monoclonal antibody, 5d4, that identifies resting, ramified microglia, the distribution and density of microglia in the retina, and the subretinal space were determined by confocal microscopy and by immunohistochemistry of cryopreserved sections of eyes of albino and pigmented mice exposed to diverse levels of light, ranging from complete darkness to intense brightness. axotomized retinal ganglion cells were retrograde labeled by fluorescent tracer to determine whether the marker colocalizes to 5d4+ cells. electron microscopy was used to evaluate microglia for evidence of phagocytosis.   results 5d4+ microglia in pigmented eyes were limited to the inner retinal layers, but in albino eyes 5d4+ cells were found in the outer retinal layers and subretinal space as well. the subretinal space of eyes of albino mice raised from birth in complete darkness contained few 5d4+ cells, but exposure to light caused the rapid accumulation of 5d4+ cells at this site. 5d4+ cell density in the subretinal space correlated directly with intensity of ambient light. retrograde labeling of axotomized ganglion cells resulted in 5d4+ cells in the subretinal space that contained the retrograde label. subretinal microglia contained phagocytized rod outer segment discs. on intense light exposure, 5d4+ cells adopted an active morphology, but failed to express class ii major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecules.   conclusions light exposure induced retinal microglia migration into the subretinal space in albino mice. subretinal microglia appeared to augment through phagocytosis the capacity of pigment epithelium to take up the photoreceptor debris of light toxicity. the unexpected presence of these cells in the subretinal space raises questions concerning their potential contribution to immune privilege in this space and to the fate of retinal transplants.  this study determined the minimum cyclic (12l:12d) light intensity which produces retinal damage in albino (sprague-dawley) rats raised from birth to 15 weeks of age under 6 lx (12l:12d). four experimental light intensities were tested, viz. 1345, 270, 130 and 65 lx. control animals remained under 6 lx. after various durations of exposure to one of the intensities tested, the retinas of groups of six rats were evaluated for physiological and morphological evidence of light damage. the indices of damage were: (1) histological and morphometric changes in the retina, and (2) changes in the amplitude and latency of the b-wave of the electroretinogram. light intensities of 1345- or 270 lx severely damage retinas of albino rats raised from birth under 6 lx within 3-7 days of the initiation of light exposure. exposure to 130- or 65 lx produced much less dramatic changes in the responsiveness and morphology of the retina that did not appear to be permanent. based on these results, a reasonable estimate for the threshold cyclic-light intensity which produces damage to retinas of albino rats raised under 6 lx lies between 65- and 130 lx, or slightly more than 1 log unit above the light intensity under which the animals were raised. the effects of an animal's light history on retinal susceptibility to light damage are discussed.
introduction e-health is an innovative way to make health services more effective and efficient and application is increasing worldwide. e-health represents a substantial ict investment and its failure usually results in substantial losses in time, money (including opportunity costs) and effort. therefore it is important to assess e-health readiness prior to implementation. several frameworks have been published on e-health readiness assessment, under various circumstances and geographical regions of the world. however, their utility for the developing world is unknown. methods a literature review and analysis of published e-health readiness assessment frameworks or models was performed to determine if any are appropriate for broad assessment of e-health readiness in the developing world. a total of 13 papers described e-health readiness in different settings. results and discussion eight types of e-health readiness were identified and no paper directly addressed all of these. the frameworks were based upon varying assumptions and perspectives. there was no underlying unifying theory underpinning the frameworks. few assessed government and societal readiness, and none cultural readiness; all are important in the developing world. while the shortcomings of existing frameworks have been highlighted, most contain aspects that are relevant and can be drawn on when developing a framework and assessment tools for the developing world. what emerged is the need to develop different assessment tools for the various stakeholder sectors. this is an area that needs further research before attempting to develop a more generic framework for the developing world.  background: concept of e-readiness is used in many areas such as e-business, e-commerce, e-government, and e-banking. in terms of healthcare, e-readiness is a rather new concept, and is propounded under the title of e-healthcare. e-health readiness refers to the readiness of communities and healthcare institutions for the expected changes brought by programs related to information and communications technology (lct). the present research is conducted aiming at designing e-health readiness assessment framework (ehraf) in iran. methods: the e-health readiness assessment framework was designed based on reviewing literature on e-readiness assessment models and opinions of ict and health experts. in the next step, delphi method was used to develop and test the designed framework. three questionnaires developed to test and modify the model while determining weights of the indices; afterward they were either sent to experts through email or delivered to them in face. results: the designed framework approved with 4 dimensions, 11 constituents and 58 indices. technical readiness had the highest importance coefficient (0.256099), and the other dimensions were of the next levels of coefficient importance: core readiness (0.25520), social communication readiness (0.244658), and engagement readiness (0.244039). conclusion: the framework presents the movement route and investment priorities in e-health in iran. the proposed framework is a good instrument for measuring the e-readiness in health centers in iran, and for identifying strengths and weaknesses of these centers to access ict and its implementation for more effectiveness and for analyzing digital divide between them, as well.
a novel posttranscriptional mechanism for regulating the neuronal protein gap-43 is reported. the mrna-binding protein hnrnp-q1 represses gap-43 mrna translation by a mechanism involving a 5′ untranslated region g-quadruplex structure, which affects gap-43 function, as demonstrated by a gap-43–dependent increase in neurite length and number with hnrnp-q1 knockdown.  during axonal regeneration synthesis of different growth‐associated proteins is increased. as yet there is no clear picture of the specific contribution made by the transcriptional and post‐transcriptional machinery that provides the gene products necessary for process outgrowth. here we focus our study on the transcriptional processes in neurons by using intron‐directed in situ hybridization to the primary transcript of a brain growth protein gap‐43. in most brain regions, levels of primary transcript expression of gap‐43 were highly correlated with levels of its mrna. however, there were notable dissociations: in hippocampal granule cells, high levels of primary transcript were evident yet no gap‐43 mrna was detected. in locus coeruleus the reverse was true; there were high levels of gap‐43 mrna but no detectable primary transcript. a primary transcript antitermination mechanism is proposed to explain the first dissociation, and a post‐transcriptional mrna stabilization mechanism to explain the second. transcriptional activation during nerve regeneration was monitored by assessing primary transcript induction of gap‐43 in mouse facial motor neurons. this induction, as well as its mrna, was restricted to the side of the facial nerve crush. increases were first observed at 24 h with a rapid increase in both measures up to 3 days. to our knowledge, this is the first in vivo evidence demonstrating transcriptional activation of a brain growth protein in regenerating neurons. the present study points to the gap‐43 transcriptional mechanism as a key determinant of gap‐43 synthesis. along with the recruitment of post‐transcriptional mechanisms, such synthesis occurs in response to both intrinsic developmental programs and extrinsic environmental signals.
dichloromethane (dcm) dehalogenase converts dcm to formaldehyde via the formation of glutathione metabolites and generates 2 mol hcl per mol dcm metabolized. growth of escherichia coli expressing dcm dehalogenase was immediately and severely inhibited during conversion of 0.3 mm dcm. intracellular ph (ph(i)) rapidly decreased and chloride ions were steadily released into the medium. bacterial growth resumed after completion of dcm conversion and cell viability was unaffected. at 0.6 mm dcm there was no recovery from growth inhibition in liquid culture due to the build-up of inhibitory concentrations of formaldehyde. dcm turnover stimulated potassium efflux from cells, which was suppressed by glucose. the potassium efflux, therefore, did not contribute to growth inhibition. it was concluded that initial growth inhibition results from lowering of the cytoplasmic ph, but severity of growth inhibition was greater than expected for the change in ph(i). possible contributors to growth inhibition are discussed.  abstract the kinetic properties of bacterial and rat liver glutathione s-transferases (gst) active with dichloromethane (dcm) were compared. the theta class glutathione s-transferase (rgstt1-1) from rat liver had an affinity for dihalomethanes lower by three orders of magnitude (kapp > 50 mm) than the bacterial dcm dehalogenase/gst from methylophilus sp. dm11. unlike the bacterial dcm dehalogenase, the rat enzyme was unable to support growth of the dehalogenase minus methylobacterium sp. dm4-2cr mutant with dcm. moreover, the presence of dcm inhibited growth with methanol of the dm4-2cr transconjugant expressing the rat liver gstt1-1. in salmonella typhimurium ta1535, expression of rat and bacterial dcm-active gst from a plasmid in the presence of dcm yielded up to 5.3 times more reversions to histidine prototrophy in the transconjugant expressing the rat enzyme. under the same conditions, however, gst-mediated conversion of dcm to formaldehyde was lower in cell-free extracts of the transconjugant expressing the rat gstt1 than in the corresponding strain expressing the bacterial dcm dehalogenase. this provided new evidence that formaldehyde was not the main toxicant associated with gst-mediated dcm conversion, and indicated that an intermediate in the transformation of dcm by gst, presumably s-chloromethylglutathione, was responsible for the observed effects. the marked differences in substrate affinity of rat and bacterial dcm-active gst, as well as in the toxicity and genotoxicity associated with expression of these enzymes in bacteria, suggest that bacterial dcm dehalogenases/gst have evolved to minimise the toxic effects associated with glutathione-mediated catalysis of dcm conversion.
this study aims to model the economic impact of subcutaneous methotrexate (sc mtx) or a biologic over a 12-month period using a hypothetical population of rheumatoid arthritis patients who failed to tolerate or respond to oral mtx and were suitable candidates for biologic therapy. a decision-based model was developed using current national institute for health and clinical excellence (nice) guidance to determine the management of this hypothetical uk population. published data on the continuation rates of sc mtx and biologics were used to compare the costs of the two treatment options. the economic model used a cost-minimisation methodology from a uk national health service (nhs) perspective, with the cost of all drugs and resources being estimated on this basis. sensitivity analyses were also performed to determine the effects of changing key assumptions on the mean cost differences. the routine use of sc mtx following oral mtx failure has the potential to save an estimated £7,197 per patient in the first year of therapy and £9.3m per year nationally in new patients. sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the results. the results of this study suggest that routine use of sc mtx following oral mtx failure has the potential to provide considerable savings to the nhs through optimised use of mtx first-line therapy. it is proposed, therefore, that patients should start on oral mtx with a subsequent switch to sc mtx in the case of an insufficient response or tolerability issues, before introducing a biologic agent.  chris deighton1, kimme hyrich2, tina ding1, jo ledingham3, mark lunt2, raashid luqmani4, patrick kiely5, marwan bukhari6, rikki abernethy7, andrew ostor8, ailsa bosworth9, kate gadsby1, frank mckenna10, diana finney11 and josh dixey12, on behalf of bsr clinical affairs committee & standards, audit and guidelines working group and the bhpr 1rheumatology department, royal derby hospital, derby; 2arc epidemiology unit, university of manchester, manchester; 3rheumatology unit, queen alexandra hospital, portsmouth; 4rheumatology department, nuffi eld orthopaedic centre, oxford; 5rheumatology department, st george’s healthcare, london; 6rheumatology department, royal lancaster infi rmary, lancaster; 7rheumatology department, st helens hospital, st helens; 8rheumatology department, addenbrooke’s hospital, cambridge; 9national rheumatoid arthritis society, maidenhead; 10department of rheumatology, trafford general hospital, manchester; 11rheumatology unit, worthing and southlands nhs trust, worthing; 12department of rheumatology, robert jones and agnes hunt orthopaedic hospital, oswestry, uk
epstein-barr virus (ebv) is associated with roughly 10% of gastric carcinomas worldwide (ebvagc). although previous investigations provide a strong link between ebv and gastric carcinomas, these studies were performed using selected ebv gene probes. using a cohort of gastric carcinoma rna-seq data sets from the cancer genome atlas (tcga), we performed a quantitative and global assessment of ebv gene expression in gastric carcinomas and assessed ebv associated cellular pathway alterations. ebv transcripts were detected in 17% of samples but these samples varied significantly in ebv coverage depth. in four samples with the highest ebv coverage (hiebvagc – high ebv associated gastric carcinoma), transcripts from the bamhi a region comprised the majority of ebv reads. expression of lmp2, and to a lesser extent, lmp1 were also observed as was evidence of abortive lytic replication. analysis of cellular gene expression indicated significant immune cell infiltration and a predominant ifng response in samples expressing high levels of ebv transcripts relative to samples expressing low or no ebv transcripts. despite the apparent immune cell infiltration, high levels of the cytotoxic t-cell (ctl) and natural killer (nk) cell inhibitor, ido1, was observed in the hiebvagcs samples suggesting an active tolerance inducing pathway in this subgroup. these results were confirmed in a separate cohort of 21 vietnamese gastric carcinoma samples using qrt-pcr and on tissue samples using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. lastly, a panel of tumor suppressors and candidate oncogenes were expressed at lower levels in hiebvagc versus ebv-low and ebv-negative gastric cancers suggesting the direct regulation of tumor pathways by ebv.  merkel cell carcinoma (mcc) is a rare but aggressive human skin cancer that typically affects elderly and immunosuppressed individuals, a feature suggestive of an infectious origin. we studied mcc samples by digital transcriptome subtraction and detected a fusion transcript between a previously undescribed virus t antigen and a human receptor tyrosine phosphatase. further investigation led to identification and sequence analysis of the 5387–base-pair genome of a previously unknown polyomavirus that we call merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv or mcpyv). mcv sequences were detected in 8 of 10 (80%) mcc tumors but only 5 of 59 (8%) control tissues from various body sites and 4 of 25 (16%) control skin tissues. in six of eight mcv-positive mccs, viral dna was integrated within the tumor genome in a clonal pattern, suggesting that mcv infection and integration preceded clonal expansion of the tumor cells. thus, mcv may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of mcc.
pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the united states. it is identified by its rapid, invasive progression with a profound resistance to treatments such as chemotherapy. unfortunately, there is a lack of information on how to effectively inhibit and control the rapid growth of pancreatic tumors, as well as limited information for diagnostics. with current methods, pancreatic cancer will continue to prevail as a leading cause of cancer death. we propose to study the complexity of pancreatic tumors with a systematic and analytical approach. cancer is an abnormal growth of tissue caused by uncontrolled cell division. observing the growth of these cells would prove to have a good basis to monitor the growth of a tumor. here we create a 3-d simulation of tumor growth through mathematical modeling, using data from pancreatic cells grown in vitro. using 3-d models will help to understand pancreatic tumors at cellular and molecular levels. the project aims to observe realistic growth of the tumor, accomplished from growing tumor cells on a monolayer in order to find parameters for our 3d mathematical model. this method will prove more beneficial than testing only on a monolayer cell line. although cell death and the toxicity of drug dosage can be tested using a cell monolayer alone, it does not meet the demands of testing drug delivery in a realistic tumor environment that the mathematical model would provide. the monolayer lacks the dimensions that the drug would have to travel if it were delivered to a real in vivo tumor. a possible continuation of this project in the future could be to utilize the mathematical based approach to predict optimal therapy for the pancreatic tumor in order to develop models that can better test patient care for tumors. computer modeling, another stepping stone through mathematical modeling, will possibly lead to testing the toxic effects of drugs on a 3-d model through computer modeling will aid in understanding the delivery of drugs throughout the tumor in vivo.  abstract we study solid tumor (carcinoma) growth in the nonlinear regime using boundary-integral simulations. the tumor core is nonnecrotic and no inhibitor chemical species are present. a new formulation of the classical models [18,24,8,3] is developed and it is demonstrated that tumor evolution is described by a reduced set of two dimensionless parameters and is qualitatively unaffected by the number of spatial dimensions. one parameter describes the relative rate of mitosis to the relaxation mechanisms (cell mobility and cell-to-cell adhesion). the other describes the balance between apoptosis (programmed cell-death) and mitosis. both parameters also include the effect of vascularization. our analysis and nonlinear simulations reveal that the two new dimensionless groups uniquely subdivide tumor growth into three regimes associated with increasing degrees of vascularization: low (diffusion dominated, e.g., in vitro), moderate and high vascularization, that correspond to the regimes observed in vivo. we demonstrate that critical conditions exist for which the tumor evolves to nontrivial dormant states or grows self-similarly (i.e., shape invariant) in the first two regimes. this leads to the possibility of shape control and of controlling the release of tumor angiogenic factors by restricting the tumor volume-to-surface-area ratio. away from these critical conditions, evolution may be unstable leading to invasive fingering into the external tissues and to topological transitions such as tumor breakup and reconnection. interestingly we find that for highly vascularized tumors, while they grow unbounded, their shape always stays compact and invasive fingering does not occur. this is in agreement with recent experimental observations [30] of in vivo tumor growth, and suggests that the invasive growth of highly-vascularized tumors is associated to vascular and elastic anisotropies, which are not included in the model studied here.
monoamines and neuropeptides interact to modulate behavioral plasticity in both vertebrates and invertebrates. in caenorhabditis elegans behavioral state or “mood” is dependent on food availability and is translated by both monoaminergic and peptidergic signaling in the fine-tuning of most behaviors. in the present study, we have examined the interaction of monoamines and peptides on c. elegans aversive behavior mediated by a pair of polymodal, nociceptive, ash sensory neurons. food or serotonin sensitize the ashs and stimulate aversive responses through a pathway requiring the release of nlp-3-encoded neuropeptides from the ashs. peptides encoded by nlp-3 appear to stimulate ash-mediated aversive behavior through the neuropeptide receptor-17 (npr-17) receptor. nlp-3- and npr-17-null animals exhibit identical phenotypes and animals overexpressing either nlp-3 or npr-17 exhibit elevated aversive responses off food that are absent when nlp-3 or npr-17 are overexpressed in npr-17- or nlp-3-null animals, respectively. ash-mediated aversive responses are increased by activating either gαq or gαs in the ashs, with gαs signaling specifically stimulating the release of nlp-3-encoded peptides. in contrast, octopamine appears to inhibit 5-ht stimulation by activating gαo signaling in the ashs that, in turn, inhibits both gαs and gαq signaling and the release of nlp-3-encoded peptides. these results demonstrate that serotonin and octopamine reversibly modulate the activity of the ashs, and highlight the utility of the c. elegans model for defining interactions between monoamines and peptides in individual neurons of complex sensory-mediated circuits.  neuropeptides play critical roles in synaptic signaling in all nervous systems. unlike classical neurotransmitters, peptidergic neurotransmitters are encoded as preproproteins that are posttranslationally processed to yield bioactive neuropeptides. to identify novel peptidergic neurotransmitters, the caenorhabditis elegans genome was searched for predicted proteins with the structural hallmarks of neuropeptide preproproteins. thirty-two c. elegans neuropeptide-like protein (nlp) genes were identified. the nlp genes define at least 11 families of putative neuropeptides with unique motifs; similar expressed sequence tags were identified in other invertebrate species for all 11 families. six of these families are defined by putative bioactive motifs (fafa, ggxyamide, mrxamide, lqfamide, lxdxamide, and ggaraf); the remaining five families are related to allatostatin, myomodulin, buccalin/drosulfakinin, orcokinin, and apgwamide neuropeptides (mgl/famide, frpamide, msfamide, gfxgf, and yggwamide families, respectively). most c. elegans nlp gene expression is in neurons. the c. elegans nlp genes and similar genes encoding putative neuropeptides in other species are likely to play diverse roles in nervous system function.
audio annotation is key to developing machine-listening systems; yet, effective ways to accurately and rapidly obtain crowdsourced audio annotations is understudied. in this work, we seek to quantify the reliability/redundancy trade-off in crowdsourced soundscape annotation, investigate how visualizations affect accuracy and efficiency, and characterize how performance varies as a function of audio characteristics. using a controlled experiment, we varied sound visualizations and the complexity of soundscapes presented to human annotators. results show that more complex audio scenes result in lower annotator agreement, and spectrogram visualizations are superior in producing higher quality annotations at lower cost of time and human labor. we also found recall is more affected than precision by soundscape complexity, and mistakes can be often attributed to certain sound event characteristics. these findings have implications not only for how we should design annotation tasks and interfaces for audio data, but also how we train and evaluate machine-listening systems.  acoustic sensors play an important role in augmenting the traditional biodiversity monitoring activities carried out by ecologists and conservation biologists. with this ability however comes the burden of analysing large volumes of complex acoustic data. given the complexity of acoustic sensor data, fully automated analysis for a wide range of species is still a significant challenge. this research investigates the use of citizen scientists to analyse large volumes of environmental acoustic data in order to identify bird species. specifically, it investigates ways in which the efficiency of a user can be improved through the use of species identification tools and the use of reputation models to predict the accuracy of users with unidentified skill levels. initial experimental results are reported.
reordering models are one of essential components of statistical machine translation. in this paper, we propose a topic-based reordering model to predict orders for neighboring blocks by capturing topic-sensitive reordering patterns. we automatically learn reordering examples from bilingual training data, which are associated with document-level and word-level topic information induced by lda topic model. these learned reordering examples are used as evidences to train a topic-based reordering model that is built on a maximum entropy (maxent) classifier. we conduct large-scale experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed topic-based reordering model on the nist chinese-to-english translation task. experimental results show that our topic-based reordering model achieves significant performance improvement over the conventional reordering model using only lexical information.  statistical machine translation systems are usually trained on a large amount of bilingual sentence pairs and translate one sentence at a time, ignoring document-level information. in this paper, we propose a cache-based approach to document-level translation. since caches mainly depend on relevant data to supervise subsequent decisions, it is critical to fill the caches with highly-relevant data of a reasonable size. in this paper, we present three kinds of caches to store relevant document-level information: 1) a dynamic cache, which stores bilingual phrase pairs from the best translation hypotheses of previous sentences in the test document; 2) a static cache, which stores relevant bilingual phrase pairs extracted from similar bilingual document pairs (i.e. source documents similar to the test document and their corresponding target documents) in the training parallel corpus; 3) a topic cache, which stores the target-side topic words related with the test document in the source-side. in particular, three new features are designed to explore various kinds of document-level information in above three kinds of caches. evaluation shows the effectiveness of our cache-based approach to document-level translation with the performance improvement of 0.81 in blue score over moses. especially, detailed analysis and discussion are presented to give new insights to document-level translation.
the incidence of dementia and obstructive sleep apnea (osa) increases with age. late‐onset alzheimer's disease (ad) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease of the elderly characterized by amyloid β (aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. the disease involves widespread synaptic loss in the neocortex and the hippocampus. rodent and clinical studies suggest that osa impairs the structural integrity of several brain regions, including the medial temporal lobe. indeed, hypoxia, hypertension, hypoperfusion, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress noted in osa patients also occur in ad patients. this review highlights pathological commonality, showing that osa upregulates aβ, tau hyperphosphorylation, and synaptic dysfunction. indeed, osa and hypertension trigger hypoperfusion and hypometabolism of brain regions, including cortex and hippocampus. several studies show that hypertension‐driven brain damage and pathogenic mechanisms lead to an aβ increase. the pathophysiological mechanism by which osa enhances hypertension may be linked to sympathoexcitation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. strong pathophysiological similarities that exist between osa and ad are underscored here. for example, the hippocampus is negatively impacted in both osa and ad. osa promotes hippocampal atrophy, which is associated with memory impairment. cognitive impairment, even in the absence of manifest dementia, is an important independent predictor of mortality. however, several pathophysiological mechanisms in osa are reversible with appropriate therapy. osa, therefore, is a modifiable risk factor of cognitive dysfunction, and treating osa prior to mild cognitive impairment may be an effective prevention strategy to reduce risk for cognitive decline and ad in middle‐aged persons and the elderly. © 2015 wiley periodicals, inc.  abstractthe purpose of the present study was to compare exercise status during the follicular (fp) and luteal (lp) phases of the menstrual cycle of a single group of young, sedentary women, where the marked differential in the blood concentrations of 17β-oestradiol ([e2]) and progesterone ([p4]) has the potential to alter the metabolic response to exercise. fourteen females [21.8 (4.0) years, peak oxygen uptake (v̇o2peak) <45 ml·kg −1·min−1] performed both incremental exercise to exhaustion and steady-state submaximal cycle ergometer exercise while measurements were made of several metabolic and hormonal variables. with the incremental exercise test, time to exhaustion, maximal power output and total work done were not different between the two phases, nor were the absolute values for v̇o2peak or the corresponding values for ventilation (v̇e), respiratory frequency (fr) and heart rate (hr). resting, end-exercise and peak (post-exercise) plasma lactate concentrations and the lactate threshold were not different between the two phases either. however, as the workloads increased during the incremental protocol, plasma lactate concentration, carbon dioxide output (v̇co2) and the respiratory exchange ratio (rer) all were lower during lp, while oxygen uptake (v̇o2) was higher. with steady-state submaximal exercise, at workloads corresponding to 25% and 75% of menstrual cycle phase-specific v̇o2peak, v̇o2 and the oxygen pulse (v̇o2/hr) were higher and rer and plasma lactate concentration lower during lp. regardless of phase, [e2] increased with both incremental and steady-state submaximal exercise, while [p4] was unchanged. it is concluded that while exercise capacity, as defined by v̇o2peak and the lactate threshold, is unaffected by cycle phase in young, sedentary women, the metabolic responses in the lp during both incremental and steady-state submaximal exercise suggest a greater dependence on fat as an energy source.
background: osteoprotegerin (opg) is considered to be the cytokine that plays an important role in the healing process. opg regulates bone cell biology, osteoblast–osteoclast, bone-immune cross-talk and maintenance of bone mass. it plays an important role in the development, induction, and repair of bone. orthognathic surgery as multiples segmental osteotomies has been taken as a model surgery to assess the changes in osteoprotegerin levels in the post-operative bone healing period. aim: the aim of the study was to evaluate opg as immunological caliper of bone healing. material and methods: opg was evaluated in nine patients seeking orthognathic surgery. patients were examined and checked to be medically and immunologically free prior to surgery. blood samples were collected immediate pre-operative as control group and for six weeks post-operative as study group. results: data were collected from nine consecutive patients. the results showed higher levels of opg. it showed significant increase in the immediate post-operative value (p = 0.001) which started to increase gradually during the six weeks (p < 0.001). conclusions: significant higher levels of opg during the healing period of orthognathic surgery suggest the its use as immunological caliper of bone healing.  fracture healing is an ordered process that restores the structural integrity of the bone. soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kb (srank), its ligand (srankl) and osteoprotegerin (opg) are involved in bone remodelling, thus they may play a role in fracture repair. opg, soluble rank and rankl levels were measured in plasma and in drainage fluid, collected from pre-surgery phase to healing in ten patients of both genders (age range 26–65 years) with proximal humerus fracture needing osteosynthesis. all patients showed fracture healing. no significant modifications in the concentrations of srankl and opg were observed, while srank showed a significant increase in drainage fluid 24 hours post-surgery compared with intra-surgery time. opg levels were higher in plasma and drainage fluid than srank and srankl at each time point. since there are no published data about srank involvement in fracture healing, our study represents the first preliminary indication about a local increase of this marker concentration immediately after surgery.
the molecular basis for regulation of dendritic cell (dc) development and homeostasis remains unclear. signal regulatory protein α (sirpα), an immunoglobulin superfamily protein that is predominantly expressed in dcs, mediates cell-cell signaling by interacting with cd47, another immunoglobulin superfamily protein. we now show that the number of cd11c(high) dcs (conventional dcs, or cdcs), in particular, that of cd8-cd4+ (cd4+) cdcs, is selectively reduced in secondary lymphoid tissues of mice expressing a mutant form of sirpα that lacks the cytoplasmic region. we also found that sirpα is required intrinsically within cdcs or dc precursors for the homeostasis of splenic cd4+ cdcs. differentiation of bone marrow cells from sirpα mutant mice into dcs induced by either macrophage-granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or flt3 ligand in vitro was not impaired. although the accumulation of the immediate precursors of cdcs in the spleen was also not impaired, the half-life of newly generated splenic cd4+ cdcs was markedly reduced in sirpα mutant mice. both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cd47 was found to be required for the homeostasis of cd4+ cdcs and cd8-cd4- (double negative) cdcs in the spleen. sirpα as well as its ligand, cd47, are thus important for the homeostasis of cd4+ cdcs or double negative cdcs in lymphoid tissues.  signal regulatory protein (sirp)alpha, also known as shps-1 or sirpa, is a transmembrane protein that binds to the protein tyrosine phosphatases shp-1 and shp-2 through its cytoplasmic region and is predominantly expressed in neurons, dendritic cells and macrophages. cd47, a widely expressed transmembrane protein, is a ligand for sirpalpha, with the two proteins constituting a cell-cell communication system. the interaction of sirpalpha with cd47 is important for the regulation of migration and phagocytosis. recent studies have implicated the cd47-sirpalpha signalling pathway in immune homeostasis and in regulation of neuronal networks. advances in the structural and functional analyses of the cd47-sirpalpha signalling pathway now provide exciting hints of the therapeutic benefits of manipulating this signalling system in autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders.
the degree of vascularization in breast lesions is related to their malignancy. for this reason, functional diagnostic imaging techniques have become important in recent years. dual-energy contrast-enhanced mammography is a new, apparently promising technique in breast cancer that provides information about the degree of vascularization of the lesion in addition to the morphological information provided by conventional mammography. this article describes the state of the art for dual-energy contrast-enhanced mammography. based on 15 months' clinical experience, we illustrate this review with clinical cases that allow us to discuss the advantages and limitations of this technique.  background experimental evidence suggests that the growth of a tumor beyond a certain size requires angiogenesis, which may also permit metastasis. to investigate how tumor angiogenesis correlates with metastases in breast carcinoma, we counted microvessels (capillaries and venules) and graded the density of microvessels within the initial invasive carcinomas of 49 patients (30 with metastases and 19 without).   methods using light microscopy, we highlighted the vessels by staining their endothelial cells immunocytochemically for factor viii. the microvessels were carefully counted (per 200x field), and their density was graded (1 to 4+), in the most active areas of neovascularization, without knowledge of the outcome in the patient, the presence or absence of metastases, or any other pertinent variable.   results both microvessel counts and density grades correlated with metastatic disease. the mean (+/- sd) count and grade in the patients with metastases were 101 +/- 49.3 and 2.95 +/- 1.00 vessels, respectively. the corresponding values in the patients without metastases were significantly lower--45 +/- 21.1 and 1.38 +/- 0.82 (p = 0.003 and p less than or equal to 0.001, respectively). for each 10-microvessel increase in the count per 200x field, there was a 1.59-fold increase in the risk of metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 2.12; p = 0.003). the microvessel count and density grade also correlated with distant metastases. for each 10-microvessel increase in the vessel count per 200x field, there was a 1.17-fold increase in the risk of distant metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34; p = 0.029).   conclusions the number of microvessels per 200x field in the areas of most intensive neovascularization in an invasive breast carcinoma may be an independent predictor of metastatic disease either in axillary lymph nodes or at distant sites (or both). assessment of tumor angiogenesis may therefore prove valuable in selecting patients with early breast carcinoma for aggressive therapy.
several features of bird basilar papilla morphology were quantitatively studied in the starling and the pigeon in order to attempt a structure-function correlation. we confirmed and quantified several findings from earlier studies, but also obtained results contradictory to previous reports. the greatest discrepancies concerned the pattern of hair cell orientation. by including the results from other investigations, we describe a 'typical' avian basilar papilla and on this basis the specializations within individual species. these morphological specializations are discussed in the context of the available physiological data.  the basilar papilla of the barn owl's (tyto alba) cochlea was found to be 9.5-11.5 mm long. histological examination revealed that the sensory hair cells had a characteristic distribution: the proximal half contained mostly typical short cells; tall hair cells were present only on the distal half along with many short cells. lenticular short cells occupied the proximal tip of the papilla. another unusual feature of the proximal part was a dense fibrous mass in the basilar membrane. this was absent from the distal one-fourth.
the reovirus fusion-associated small transmembrane (fast) proteins function as virus-encoded cellular fusogens, mediating efficient cell–cell rather than virus–cell membrane fusion. with ectodomains of only ∼20–40 residues, it is unclear how such diminutive viral fusion proteins mediate the initial stages (i.e. membrane contact and close membrane apposition) of the fusion reaction that precede actual membrane merger. we now show that the fast proteins lack specific receptor-binding activity, and in their natural biological context of promoting cell–cell fusion, rely on cadherins to promote close membrane apposition. the fast proteins, however, are not specifically reliant on cadherin engagement to mediate membrane apposition as indicated by their ability to efficiently utilize other adhesins in the fusion reaction. results further indicate that surrogate adhesion proteins that bridge membranes as close as 13 nm apart enhance fast protein-induced cell–cell fusion, but active actin remodelling is required for maximal fusion activity. the fast proteins are the first example of membrane fusion proteins that have specifically evolved to function as opportunistic fusogens, designed to exploit and convert naturally occurring adhesion sites into fusion sites. the capacity of surrogate, non-cognate adhesins and active actin remodelling to enhance the cell–cell fusion activity of the fast proteins are features perfectly suited to the structural and functional evolution of these fusogens as the minimal fusion component of a virus-encoded cellular fusion machine. these results also provide a basis for reconciling the rudimentary structure of the fast proteins with their capacity to fuse cellular membranes.  this review analyses recent structural results that provide clues about a possible molecular mechanism for the transmission of a fusogenic signal among the envelope glycoproteins of the herpes simplex virus on receptor binding by glycoprotein gd. this signal triggers the membrane‐fusion machinery of the virus—contained in glycoproteins gb, gh and gl—to induce the merging of viral and cellular membranes, and to allow virus entry into target cells. this activating process parallels that of γ‐retroviruses, in which receptor binding by the amino‐terminal domain of the envelope protein activates the fusogenic potential of the virion in a similar way, despite the different organization of the envelope complexes of these two types of viruses. therefore, the new structural results on the interaction of gd with its receptors might also provide insights into the mechanism of fusogenic signal transmission in γ‐retroviruses. furthermore, the fusion activation parallels with retroviruses, together with the recently reported structural homology of gb with the rhabdovirus envelope glycoprotein indicate that the complex entry apparatus of herpesviruses appears to be functionally related to that of simpler enveloped viruses.
chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massive parallel sequencing (chip-seq) is a powerful technology to identify the genome-wide locations of dna binding proteins such as transcription factors or modified histones. as more and more experimental laboratories are adopting chip-seq to unravel the transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, computational analyses of chip-seq also become increasingly comprehensive and sophisticated. in this article, we review current computational methodology for chip-seq analysis, recommend useful algorithms and workflows, and introduce quality control measures at different analytical steps. we also discuss how chip-seq could be integrated with other types of genomic assays, such as gene expression profiling and genome-wide association studies, to provide a more comprehensive view of gene regulatory mechanisms in important physiological and pathological processes.  recent progress in massively parallel sequencing platforms has enabled genome-wide characterization of dna-associated proteins using the combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (chip-seq). although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative chip microarray (chip-chip), few approaches have been described for processing chip-seq data. to fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. we compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. we also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.
vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) is one of the most potent angiogenic factors. vegf plasma levels have been reported to be significantly elevated in the patients with hypertension. this study aims to elucidate the associations of the vegf −634g>c and 936c>t polymorphisms with the hypertensive patients in korea. genotyping of the vegf polymorphisms was carried out by polymerase chain reaction and endonuclease digestion. the c allele of the vegf−634g>c polymorphism and t allele of the 936c>t polymorphism were significantly higher in the hypertensive patients than in the normotensive controls. when the data of the genotype were stratified by gender, the association was gender-specific. we also found the associations of the haplotypes, composed of the vegf−634g>c and 936c>t polymorphisms, with hypertensive group. dominant models of −634g>c and 936c>t polymorphisms were associated with risk components of hypertension, according to the stratification analysis. thus, this study demonstrates that the vegf −634g>c and 936c>t polymorphisms may provide important genetic markers in identifying people at risk for hypertension. so far, association studies of vegf gene polymorphisms with the hypertensive patients were rare. therefore, further evaluation is required in other ethnic or racial populations with large samples to confirm our data.  vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) is a cytokine involved in angiogenesis and upregulated during adaptive heart hypertrophy. downregulation of vegf seems to trigger the transition from adaptive to dilated cardiac hypertrophy. we investigated for the first time whether 3 clinically relevant polymorphisms in the vegfa gene are associated with altered echocardiographic parameters in hypertensive patients. we determined genotypes for 3 polymorphisms in vegfa promoter in 179 hypertensive patients and 169 healthy controls: g.-2578c>a (rs699947), g.-1154g>a (rs1570360), and g.-634g>c (rs2010963). although the variant genotypes of the g.-634g>c (gc + cc) were associated with reduced left ventricular mass index (p = 0.030), the variant genotypes for the g.-1154g>a (ga + aa) were associated with reduced ejection fraction (p = 0.008). in addition, we found that vegfa haplotypes were associated with altered ejection fraction (p = 0.024). the aag haplotype was associated with reduced ejection fraction (p = 0.006), whereas the agg haplotype was associated with increased ejection fraction (p = 0.010). our results suggest that vegf polymorphisms affect cardiac remodeling. genotypes for vegfa polymorphisms can be useful to help to identify hypertensive patients at greater intrinsic risk for heart failure.
background in saccharomyces cerevisiae, three out of the four histone gene pairs (hta1-htb1, hht1-hhf1, and hht2-hhf2) are regulated by the hir co-repressor complex. the histone chaperone rtt106 has recently been shown to be present at these histone gene loci throughout the cell cycle in a hir- and asf1-dependent manner and involved in their transcriptional repression. the swi/snf and rsc chromatin remodeling complexes are both recruited to the hir-dependent histone genes; swi/snf is required for their activation in s phase, whereas rsc is implicated in their repression outside of s phase. even though their presence at the histone genes is dependent on the hir complex, their specific recruitment has not been well characterized. in this study we focused on characterizing the role played by the histone chaperone rtt106 in the cell cycle-dependent recruitment of swi/snf and rsc complexes to the histone genes. methodology/principal findings using gst pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that rtt106 physically interacts with both the swi/snf and rsc complexes in vitro and in vivo. we then investigated the function of this interaction with respect to the recruitment of these complexes to hir-dependent histone genes. using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (chip), we found that rtt106 is important for the recruitment of both swi/snf and rsc complexes to the hir-dependent histone genes. furthermore, using synchronized cell cultures, we showed by chip assays that the rtt106-dependent swi/snf recruitment to these histone gene loci is cell cycle regulated and restricted to late g1 phase just before the peak of histone gene expression in s phase. conclusions/significance overall, these data strongly suggest that the interaction between the histone chaperone rtt106 and both the swi/snf and rsc chromatin remodeling complexes is important for the cell cycle regulated recruitment of these two complexes to the hir-dependent histone genes.  genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the evolutionarily conserved swi/snf complex acts at a subset of genes to help transcriptional activators function on chromatin templates. the mechanism by which this complex is targeted to specific chromosomal loci remains unknown. we show that swi/snf is required for expression of the yeast histone hta1-htb1 locus because of the role of hir1p and hir2p corepressors in negatively regulating transcription. snf5p, snf2p/swi2p, and swi3p, three components of the yeast swi/snf complex, coimmunoprecipitate with each hir protein, and snf5p is maximally associated with the hta1-htb1 promoter when the hir-based repression system is intact and the swi/snf complex is functional. the data support a role for the hir repressors in the gene-specific targeting of swi/snf.
there is high comorbidity between stress-related psychiatric disorders and addiction, suggesting they may share one or more common neurobiological mechanisms. because of its role in both depressive and addictive behaviors, the galanin system is a strong candidate for such a mechanism. in this study, we tested if galanin and its receptors are involved in stress-associated behaviors and drug addiction. mice were exposed to 21 days of chronic restraint stress (crs); subsequently, mrna levels of galanin, galanin receptors (galrs), the rate-limiting enzymes for the synthesis of monoamines, and monoamine autoreceptors were measured in the nucleus accumbens by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. moreover, we tested the effects of this stress on morphine-induced addictive behaviors. we found that crs induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors, impaired the formation and facilitated the extinction process in morphine-induced conditioned place preference (cpp), and also blocked morphine-induced behavioral sensitization. these behavioral results were accompanied by a crs-dependent increase in the mrna expression of galanin, galr1, tyrosine hydroxylase (th), tryptophan hydroxylase 2, and 5-ht1b receptor. interestingly, treatment with a commonly used antidepressant, fluoxetine, normalized the crs-induced behavioral changes based on reversing the higher expression of galanin and th while increasing the expression of galr2 and α2a-adrenceptor. these results indicate that activating the galanin system, with corresponding changes to noradrenergic systems, following chronic stress may modulate stress-associated behaviors and opiate addiction. our findings suggest that galanin and galrs are worthy of further exploration as potential therapeutic targets to treat stress-related disorders and drug addiction.  stressors can exert a wide variety of responses, ranging from adaptive responses to pathological changes; moreover, recent studies suggest that mild stressors can attenuate the response of a system to major stressful events. we have previously shown that 2‐week exposure to cold, a comparatively mild inescapable stressor, induced a pronounced reduction in ventral tegmental area (vta) dopamine (da) neuron activity, whereas restraint stress increases da neuron activity. however, it is not known if these stressors differentially impact the vta in a region‐specific manner, if they differentially impact behavioral responses, or whether the effects of such different stressors are additive or antagonistic with regard to their impact on da neuron firing. to address these questions, single‐unit extracellular recordings were performed in anesthetized control rats and rats exposed to chronic cold, and tested after delivery of a 2‐h restraint session. chronic cold stress strongly attenuated the number of da neurons firing in the vta, and this effect occurred primarily in the medial and central vta regions that preferentially project to reward‐related ventral striatal regions. chronic cold exposure also prevented the pronounced increase in da neuron population activity without affecting the behavioral sensitization to amphetamine produced by restraint stress. taken together, these data show that a prolonged inescapable mild stressor can induce plastic changes that attenuate the da system response to acute stress.
chronic kidney disease (ckd) is a worldwide public health threat that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular complications, including left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh). novel therapeutic targets are needed to design treatments to alleviate the cardiovascular burden of ckd. previously, we demonstrated that circulating concentrations of fibroblast growth factor (fgf) 23 rise progressively in ckd and induce lvh through an unknown fgf receptor (fgfr)-dependent mechanism. here, we report that fgf23 exclusively activates fgfr4 on cardiac myocytes to stimulate phospholipase cγ/calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated t cell signaling. a specific fgfr4-blocking antibody inhibits fgf23-induced hypertrophy of isolated cardiac myocytes and attenuates lvh in rats with ckd. mice lacking fgfr4 do not develop lvh in response to elevated fgf23, whereas knockin mice carrying an fgfr4 gain-of-function mutation spontaneously develop lvh. thus, fgf23 promotes lvh by activating fgfr4, thereby establishing fgfr4 as a pharmacological target for reducing cardiovascular risk in ckd.  chronic kidney disease (ckd) is a public health epidemic that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular disease. left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) is an important mechanism of cardiovascular disease in individuals with ckd. elevated levels of fgf23 have been linked to greater risks of lvh and mortality in patients with ckd, but whether these risks represent causal effects of fgf23 is unknown. here, we report that elevated fgf23 levels are independently associated with lvh in a large, racially diverse ckd cohort. fgf23 caused pathological hypertrophy of isolated rat cardiomyocytes via fgf receptor-dependent activation of the calcineurin-nfat signaling pathway, but this effect was independent of klotho, the coreceptor for fgf23 in the kidney and parathyroid glands. intramyocardial or intravenous injection of fgf23 in wild-type mice resulted in lvh, and klotho-deficient mice demonstrated elevated fgf23 levels and lvh. in an established animal model of ckd, treatment with an fgf-receptor blocker attenuated lvh, although no change in blood pressure was observed. these results unveil a klotho-independent, causal role for fgf23 in the pathogenesis of lvh and suggest that chronically elevated fgf23 levels contribute directly to high rates of lvh and mortality in individuals with ckd.
backgroundprevious studies have reported that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) might improve sleep-related breathing disorders (srbds). however, the effects of ssris on breathing are not evaluated in subjects without moderate-to-severe srbds. further, many symptoms of depression and srbds overlap, and so, it is interesting whether there are interactions between breathing and psychopathologic symptoms during ssri treatment for depression.methodsdata were taken from an open-label 8-week trial of sertraline in depressed patients with insomnia (n = 31). the depressed patients were administered 50 mg sertraline at 8 am on the first day, and the dosage was subsequently titrated up to a maximum of 200 mg/day during the 8-week trial. all the patients were tested by repeated polysomnography (psg) (baseline, 1st day, 14th day, 28th day, and 56th day). sleep-disordered breathing events were categorized as apneas, hypopneas, and respiratory event-related arousals (reras).resultsthe clinical responses and psg characteristics improved continuously during the 8-week trial. from the 14th day on, the rera index during all-night and non-rapid eye movement (nrem) sleep became stable and significantly higher than baseline and the first day (rera index 7.3 ± 2.2 at baseline, 7.3 ± 2.5 on the 1st day, 4.4 ± 1.9 on the 14th day, 3.9 ± 1.3 on the 28th day, 4.2 ± 2.0 on the 56th day, f = 5.71, p = 0.02; nrem-rera index 6.2 ± 2.0 at baseline, 6.3 ± 2.3 on the 1st day, 3.2 ± 1.5 on the 14th day, 3.5 ± 0.9 on the 28th day, 3.2 ± 1.7 on the 56th day, f = 4.92, p = 0.03). additionally, the nrem-apnea index showed a similar pattern to that of the rera index and reached a significant difference between baseline (1.0 ± 0.5) and the 14th day (0.5 ± 0.4) (kw = 4.28, p = 0.047). compared to the no-improvement group, the improvement group with a decreasing score rate of the respiratory disturbance index (rdi) greater than or equal to −50 % had a more positive decreasing score rate of slow wave sleep (sws) (439.0 ± 78.2 vs 373.2 ± 77.9 %, t = 3.46, p = 0.04) and a more negative decreasing score rate on the arousal index (−43.7 ± 16.7 vs −26.6 ± 9.7 %, t = 9.16, p = 0.01), pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi) scores (−65.1 ± 33.7 vs −49.6 ± 21.4 %, t = 4.74, p = 0.05), and epworth sleepiness scale (ess) scores (−55.7 ± 21.3 vs −36.4 ± 17.5 %, t = 6.44, p = 0.02).discussionthis research indicates that srbds could be improved to some extent by sertraline treatment, which might be more common in patients with relatively more severe sleep-disordered breathing (e.g., rdi ≥ 10 in the current study). although the sertraline-induced srbd improvement seems not to have a significant clinical effect, the srbd improvement group with decreasing score rate of rdi greater than or equal to −50 % has better subjective and objective sleep aspects than the no-improvement group. thus, the fact that the srbds’ improvement was related to ssris might have a potential clinical benefit in the antidepressant treatment.  background previous studies have reported that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) might induce or exacerbate periodic limb movements during sleep (plms). however, most of these studies were retrospective and cross-sectional studies with small sample sizes on a selective ssri, fluoxetine. because different ssris have different pharmacologic profiles, it was not certain if other ssris also might lead to plms.   methods data were taken from an open-label 8-week trial of sertraline in depressive patients with insomnia (n=31). depressed patients were administered sertraline 50mg at 8:00am on the first day, and the dosage was subsequently titrated up to a maximum of 200mg daily during the 8-week trial. all participants were tested by repeated polysomnography (psg) (baseline, first day, 14th day, 28th day, and 56th day). periodic leg movements (plm) were visually counted and the plm index (plmi) was calculated. plms was defined as plmi ⩾5, and significant plms was defined as plmi ⩾15.   results compared with baseline (plmi, 3.6±1.5), all plmi indices increased on the immediate administration of sertraline on the first day (plmi, 5.1±3.9). from the 14th day onward, plmi became stable and significantly higher than baseline and the first day (8.7±3.1 on the 14th day, 8.3±3.7 on the 28th day, and 8.5±3.6 on the 56th day; f[11.81]; p=.003). the clinical responses and psg characteristics continuously improved during the 8-week trial. the plms group (plmi ⩾5) had a higher arousal index (ai) than the non-plms group on the 14th day (9.4±5.5 vs 5.2±3.7; t test, 4.22; p=.03) and the 56th day (8.1±5.5 vs 4.3±3.7; z score, 3.11; p=.04); albeit, there was no significant clinical disturbances in the plms group.   conclusions plms were increased during sertraline treatment, but only a few of the plms reached the significant level. this effect of sertraline on plms might be dosage dependent. although the sertraline-induced plms did not seem to cause significant clinical disturbance, the plms group (plmi ⩾5) had a higher ai than the non-plms group. thus clinicians should pay more attention to plms during ssri antidepressant treatment.
purposethis study examined the usefulness of inflammatory markers in the management of patients with right iliac fossa pain.patients and methodsa single site, prospective observational study was conducted from october 2001 to april 2003. patients with right iliac fossa pain referred to the surgeon were included. blood samples were obtained for c-reactive protein, leukocyte, and granulocyte analysis. clinical, surgical, and histopathologic data were collected. analysis of inflammatory parameters was performed with logistic regression and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were compared.resultsc-reactive protein increased with the severity of appendicitis and predicted accurately perforation (r2 = 0.613; p < 0.0005), showing the highest accuracy among inflammatory markers (areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve were 0.846, 0.753, and 0.685 for c-reactive protein, leukocyte and granulocytes, respectively; p < 0.001). accuracy improved when c-reactive protein and leukocytes were combined; positive and negative predictive values were 93.2 percent and 92.3 percent, respectively.conclusionsc-reactive protein is a helpful marker in the management of patients with right iliac fossa pain; the predictive value improves when combined with leukocyte count. a patient with normal c-reactive protein and leukocytes has a very low probability of appendicitis and should not undergo surgery.  background studies have shown that c-reactive protein (crp) and total leucocyte count (wbc) in suspected acute appendicitis analysed only on admission gave valuable information to guide the surgeon. the aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of crp and wbc measured repetitively before operation.   methods during a 1-year period 227 patients were studied before emergency appendicectomy. crp and wbc were analysed every 4th h. the upper limits of the reference intervals used were 9.0 x 10(9)/l for wbc and 10 mg/l for crp.   results of the 227 appendicectomized patients, 170 (75%) had acute appendicitis. sixty-six of the patients were tested on two or more occasions every 4th h. forty-six of these patients had appendicitis; repetitive tests showed a continuing rise in crp values but a continuing decrease in wbc. the negative appendicectomy rate among these 66 patients was 30%, which theoretically would have fallen to 19% if patients with normal results had not been subjected to surgery.   conclusions repeated laboratory tests for crp and wbc should be performed in patients with suspected acute appendicitis requested to stay for further observation. if these test results are normal, the surgeon should preferably refrain from operating but consider other differential diagnoses.
in an experimental paradigm adapted from hari (1995), forty observers listened via headphones to 8 binaural clicks: 4 left-ear leading followed by 4 right-ear leading with either 38 or 140 ms interstimulus intervals (isis). concurrently, they viewed either foveal or peripheral visual stimuli designed to activate either the parvocellular or magnocellular pathway. they then reported the perceived location of each click-pair. our results replicated hari's finding that observers mistake the perceived location of short isi click-pairs more often than long. that is, when isis were short, the sounds seemed to play across the inside of the head in a phenomenon called illusory directional hearing. however, when click-pairs were accompanied by peripheral visual stimuli that activated the magnocellular pathway, observers were more accurate than when there were no visual stimuli. conversely, parvocellular-activating foveal visual stimuli produced more illusory hearing than when there were no visual stimuli. these findings suggest that activating the slow sustained parvocellular system may result in a longer processing window. thirty dyslexic observers who repeated the experimental paradigm had an even longer processing window than control observers indicating that dyslexics may have a magnocellular system deficit.  dyslexia is a common disorder with largely unknown pathophysiology. we tested ten dyslexic adults and 20 control subjects with trains of binaural clicks which led to illusory sound movements at short click intervals. in controls, the illusion disappeared at intervals exceeding 90-120 ms while in the dyslexics it persisted up to intervals of 250-500 ms. dyslexic adults thus seem to have a deficit in the processing of rapid sound sequences, which is also manifested in significant delays in their conscious auditory percepts. this pathophysiological abnormality seems to persist throughout life.
a significant decline of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d concentration [25(oh)d] with increasing latitude has been reported only for caucasians. to determine the association between serum 25(oh)d and geographic location and its impact on bone mineral density (bmd) in an asian population, a total of 17,508 subjects (8910 men and 8598 women) from the 2008–2010 korea national health and nutrition examination survey (knhanes) were stratified into four age groups and analyzed for 25(oh)d and bmd according to geographic location (south, 33° n–35° n; middle, 36° n; north, 37° n–38° n). mean 25(oh)d were 47.7 and 41.2 nmol/l; calcium intake, 564.9 & 442.3 mg/d; femoral neck bmd, 0.829 & 0.721 g/cm2; and lumbar spine bmd, 0.960 & 0.918 g/cm2 for men and women, respectively. both men and women living in the south had significantly higher 25(oh)d and femoral neck bmd for those ≥50 years old. lumbar spine bmd was significantly higher in men ≥50 years old, and for women 10–29 & 50–69 years old living in the south. a 1 or 2 degree difference in latitude has a significant effect on serum 25(oh)d and bmd in this low vitamin d status population. thus, consideration of geographic location for a recommendation of vitamin d intake may be necessary.  although the importance of solar radiation for vitamin d3 synthesis in the human body is well known, the solar exposure time required to prevent vitamin d deficiency has not been determined in japan. this study attempted to identify the time of solar exposure required for vitamin d3 synthesis in the body by season, time of day, and geographic location (sapporo, tsukuba, and naha) using both numerical simulations and observations. according to the numerical simulation for tsukuba at noon in july under a cloudless sky, 3.5 min of solar exposure are required to produce 5.5 μg vitamin d3 per 600 cm2 skin corresponding to the area of a face and the back of a pair of hands without ingestion from foods. in contrast, it took 76.4 min to produce the same quantity of vitamin d3 at sapporo in december, at noon under a cloudless sky. the necessary exposure time varied considerably with the time of the day. for tsukuba at noon in december, 22.4 min were required, but 106.0 min were required at 09:00 and 271.3 min were required at 15:00 for the same meteorological conditions. naha receives high levels of ultraviolet radiation allowing vitamin d3 synthesis almost throughout the year.
we quantified the potential effects of physiologic artifact on the estimation of eeg band power in a cohort of typically developing children in order to guide artifact rejection methods in quantitative eeg data analysis in developmental populations. high density eeg was recorded for 2 min while children, ages 2–6, watched a video of bubbles. segments of data were categorized as blinks, saccades, emg or artifact-free, and both absolute and relative power in the theta (4–7 hz), alpha (8–12 hz), beta (13–30 hz) and gamma (35–45 hz) bands were calculated in 9 regions for each category. using a linear mixed model approach with artifact type, region and their interaction as predictors, we compared mean band power between clean data and each type of artifact. we found significant differences in mean relative and absolute power between artifacts and artifact-free segments in all frequency bands. the magnitude and direction of the differences varied based on power type, region, and frequency band. the most significant differences in mean band power were found in the gamma band for emg artifact and the theta band for ocular artifacts. artifact detection strategies need to be sensitive to the oscillations of interest for a given analysis, with the most conservative approach being the removal of all emg and ocular artifact from eeg data. quantitative eeg holds considerable promise as a clinical biomarker of both typical and atypical development. however, there needs to be transparency in the choice of power type, regions of interest, and frequency band, as each of these variables are differentially vulnerable to noise, and therefore, their interpretation depends on the methods used to identify and remove artifacts.  evoked potentials and eegs record punctate electrical activity at electrode sites. to represent the overall potential distribution on the entire scalp it is necessary to interpolate between these sampled values. surface splines are mathematical tools for interpolating functions of two variables. in comparison to the classical methods of interpolation, based on linear combination of the potentials of the 4 nearest electrodes, spline methods are smoother, give more precisely located extrema and converge faster toward the 'true' potential surface when the number of recording electrodes is increased. these advantages are at the expense of lengthier computation time.
the small gtpase rap1 and the actin-junctional linker protein canoe/afadin are essential for the initial establishment of polarity in drosophila, acting upstream of bazooka/par3 and the adherens junctions. however, feedback and cross-regulation occur, so polarity establishment is regulated by a network of proteins rather than a linear pathway.  regulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction is essential for the normal physiology of metazoans and is important in many diseases. integrin adhesion receptors can rapidly increase their affinity (integrin activation) in response to intracellular signaling events in a process termed inside-out signaling. the transmembrane domains of integrins and their interactions with the membrane are important in inside-out signaling. moreover, integrin activation is tightly regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways. here, we review recent progress in understanding how the membrane environment can, in cooperation with integrin-binding proteins, regulate integrin activation.
publisher summary this chapter describes the genetic influence on normal sleep and its regulatory mechanism, and discusses recent clinical discoveries regarding the role of genetic factors in selected sleep disorders. the first sleep-related genes have been identified in monogenic disorders. most of the sleep disorders have complex phenotypes. using array technologies and performing genome-wide association studies and investigating thousands of patients and controls, common genetic susceptibility factors for sleep phenotypes are identified. genome-wide sequencing with second-generation sequencers allows detecting rare genetic variants with a large effect on the phenotype. to explore the genetics of sleep disorders, epigenetic factors should be also considered that might explain the complexity of phenotypes. sleep-related genes or mutations have been demonstrated in animal models, but, with the help of advanced molecular genetic approaches. sleep genetics will soon expand into a search among human models and lead to pharmacogenomic development for individualized sleep medicine.  neurons containing the neuropeptide orexin (hypocretin) are located exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus and send axons to numerous regions throughout the central nervous system, including the major nuclei implicated in sleep regulation. here, we report that, by behavioral and electroencephalographic criteria, orexin knockout mice exhibit a phenotype strikingly similar to human narcolepsy patients, as well as canarc-1 mutant dogs, the only known monogenic model of narcolepsy. moreover, modafinil, an anti-narcoleptic drug with ill-defined mechanisms of action, activates orexin-containing neurons. we propose that orexin regulates sleep/wakefulness states, and that orexin knockout mice are a model of human narcolepsy, a disorder characterized primarily by rapid eye movement (rem) sleep dysregulation.
the isodicentric y (idic y) chromosome is one of the most common aberrations of the human y chromosome. due to a structural instability during cell division, patients with idic y may develop mosaic karyotypes with variable phenotypes. we present a rare case of a 25-year-old male with azoospermia and infertility. in this patient, an idic yq was characterized by duplication of almost the entire y chromosome in head-to-head fashion with breakpoints occurring at the distal yp / yp11.3 with sparing of both the azf and sry regions. we discuss the possible mechanisms of azoospermia in this patient and add to the limited evidence that exists regarding the importance of pseudoautosomal regions and meiotic sex chromosome pairing as part of normal spermatogenesis.  massive palindromes in the human y chromosome harbor mirror-image gene pairs essential for spermatogenesis. during evolution, these gene pairs have been maintained by intrapalindrome, arm-to-arm recombination. the mechanism of intrapalindrome recombination and risk of harmful effects are unknown. we report 51 patients with isodicentric y (idicy) chromosomes formed by homologous crossing over between opposing arms of palindromes on sister chromatids. these ectopic recombination events occur at nearly all y-linked palindromes. based on our findings, we propose that intrapalindrome sequence identity is maintained via noncrossover pathways of homologous recombination. dna double-strand breaks that initiate these pathways can be alternatively resolved by crossing over between sister chromatids to form idicy chromosomes, with clinical consequences ranging from spermatogenic failure to sex reversal and turner syndrome. our observations imply that crossover and noncrossover pathways are active in nearly all y-linked palindromes, exposing an achilles' heel in the mechanism that preserves palindrome-borne genes.
background airway microbiota composition has been clearly correlated with many pulmonary diseases, and notably with cystic fibrosis (cf), an autosomal genetic disorder caused by mutation in the cf transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr). recently, a new molecule, ivacaftor, has been shown to re-establish the functionality of the g551d-mutated cftr, allowing significant improvement in lung function. objective and methods the purpose of this study was to follow the evolution of the airway microbiota in cf patients treated with ivacaftor, using quantitative pcr and pyrosequencing of 16s rrna amplicons, in order to identify quantitative and qualitative changes in bacterial communities. three g551d children were followed up longitudinally over a mean period of more than one year covering several months before and after initiation of ivacaftor treatment. results 129 operational taxonomy units (otus), representing 64 genera, were identified. there was no significant difference in total bacterial load before and after treatment. comparison of global community composition found no significant changes in microbiota. two otus, however, showed contrasting dynamics: after initiation of ivacaftor, the relative abundance of the anaerobe porphyromonas 1 increased (p<0.01) and that of streptococcus 1 (s. mitis group) decreased (p<0.05), possibly in relation to the anti-gram-positive properties of ivacaftor. the anaerobe prevotella 2 correlated positively with the pulmonary function test fev-1 (r=0.73, p<0.05). the study confirmed the presumed positive role of anaerobes in lung function. conclusion several airway microbiota components, notably anaerobes (obligate or facultative anaerobes), could be valuable biomarkers of lung function improvement under ivacaftor, and could shed light on the pathophysiology of lung disease in cf patients.  summary the common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (fwer). this approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. a different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. it calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. this error rate is equivalent to the fwer when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the fwer is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. a simple sequential bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. the use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.
abstract the dna damage response (ddr) that evolved to repair host cell dna damage also recognizes viral dna entering the nucleus during infections. here, we investigated the modulation of ddr signaling during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells by kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv). phosphorylation of representative ddr-associated proteins, such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (atm) and h2ax, was induced as early as 30 min (0.5 h) postinfection and persisted during in vitro kshv latency. phosphorylated h2ax (γh2ax) colocalized at 30 min (0.5 h) with the kshv genome entering the nuclei. total h2ax protein levels also increased, and the increase was attributed to a decrease in degradative h2ax lys48-linked polyubiquitination with a concomitant increase in lys63-linked polyubiquitination that was shown to increase protein stability. atm and h2ax phosphorylation and γh2ax nuclear foci were also induced by uv-inactivated kshv, which ceased at later times of infection. inhibition of atm kinase activity by ku-55933 and h2ax knockdown by small interfering rna significantly reduced the expression of the kshv latency-associated nuclear antigen 1 (lana-1; orf73) and lana-1 nuclear puncta. knockdown of h2ax also resulted in a >80% reduction in the nuclear kshv dna copy numbers. similar results were also observed in atm-negative cells, although comparable levels of viral dna entered atm-negative and atm-positive cell nuclei. in contrast, knockdown of chk1 and chk2 did not affect orf73 expression. collectively, these results demonstrate that kshv induces atm and h2ax, a selective arm of the ddr, for the establishment and maintenance of its latency during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells. importance eukaryotic cells mount a dna damage response (ddr) to sense and repair different types of cellular dna damage. in addition, ddr also recognizes exogenous genetic material, such as the viral dna genome entering the nucleus during infections. the present study was undertaken to determine whether de novo kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) infection modulates ddr. our results demonstrate that early during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells, kshv induces a selective arm of ddr signaling, such as the atm kinase and its downstream target, h2ax, which are essential for kshv's latent gene expression and the establishment of latency. these studies suggest that targeting atm and h2ax could serve as an attractive strategy to block the establishment of kshv latent infection and the associated malignancies.  abstract the dna damage response (ddr) of host cells is utilized by a number of viruses to establish and propagate their genomes in the infected cells. we examined the expression of the ddr genes during kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). the genes were mostly downregulated, except h2ax, which was upregulated during infection. h2ax is important for gammaherpesvirus infectivity, and its phosphorylation at serine 139 is crucial for maintenance of latency during mouse gamma-herpesvirus 68 (mhv-68) infection. we now also observed phosphorylation of h2ax at serine 139 during kshv infection. h2ax is a histone h2a isoform shown to interact with the latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana) encoded by kshv. here, we show that lana directly interacted with h2ax through domains at both its n and c termini. the phosphorylated form of h2ax (γh2ax) was shown to colocalize with lana. chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assays showed that a reduction in h2ax levels resulted in reduced binding of lana with kshv terminal repeats (trs). binding preferences of h2ax and γh2ax along the kshv episome were examined by whole-episome chip analysis. we showed that γh2ax had a higher relative binding activity along the tr regions than that of the long unique region (lur), which highlighted the importance of h2ax phosphorylation during kshv infection. furthermore, knockdown of h2ax resulted in decreased kshv episome copy number. notably, the c terminus of lana contributed to phosphorylation of h2ax. however, phosphorylation was not dependent on the ability of lana to drive kshv-infected cells into s-phase. thus, h2ax contributes to association of lana with the trs, and phosphorylation of h2ax is likely important for its increased density at the trs.
distiller's grains and solubles (dgs) is the major co-product of corn dry mill ethanol production, and is composed of 30% protein and 30-40% polysaccharides. we report a strategy for simultaneous extraction of protein with food-grade biobased solvents (ethyl lactate, d-limonene, and distilled methyl esters) and enzymatic saccharification of glucan in dgs. this approach would produce a high-value animal feed while simultaneously producing additional sugars for ethanol production. preliminary experiments on protein extraction resulted in recovery of 15-45% of the protein, with hydrophobic biobased solvents obtaining the best results. the integrated hydrolysis and extraction experiments showed that biobased solvent addition did not inhibit hydrolysis of the cellulose. however, only 25-33% of the total protein was extracted from dgs, and the extracted protein largely resided in the aqueous phase, not the solvent phase. we hypothesize that the hydrophobic solvent could not access the proteins surrounded by the aqueous phase inside the fibrous structure of dgs due to poor mass transfer. further process improvements are needed to overcome this obstacle.  ddgs and wet distillers' grains are the major co-products of the dry grind ethanol facilities. as they are mainly used as animal feed, a typical compositional analysis of the ddgs and wet distillers' grains mainly focuses on defining the feedstock's nutritional characteristics. with an increasing demand for fuel ethanol, the ddgs and wet distillers' grains are viewed as a potential bridge feedstock for ethanol production from other cellulosic biomass. the introduction of ddgs or wet distillers' grains as an additional feed to the existing dry grind plants for increased ethanol yield requires a different approach to the compositional analysis of the material. rather than focusing on its nutritional value, this new approach aims at determining more detailed chemical composition, especially on polymeric sugars such as cellulose, starch and xylan, which release fermentable sugars upon enzymatic hydrolysis. in this paper we present a detailed and complete compositional analysis procedure suggested for ddgs and wet distillers' grains, as well as the resulting compositions completed by three different research groups. polymeric sugars, crude protein, crude oil and ash contents of ddgs and wet distillers' grains were accurately and reproducibly determined by the compositional analysis procedure described in this paper.
abstract the edinburgh cognitive and behavioural als screen (ecas) has been developed to assess cognition and behaviour in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als). cognitive impairments of als-specific and als-non-specific functions can be determined using cut-off scores based on performance of healthy subjects. however, detailed analyses show that older healthy subjects perform worse than younger ones, whereas highly-educated individuals perform better than those with lower education levels. as a consequence, this study presents new age and education matched cut-off scores for the revised german/swiss-german version of the ecas based on the performance of 86 healthy subjects.  abstract this study presents the edinburgh cognitive and behavioural als screen (ecas), developed for als patients with physical disability for use by health care professionals. the screen is designed to detect the specific profile of cognition and behaviour changes in als and to differentiate it from other disorders. forty-eight als patients (none with evident dementia), 40 healthy controls and 20 carers were recruited. the ecas, a 15–20-min screen, includes an als-specific score (executive functions and social cognition; fluency; language); an als non-specific score (memory; visuospatial functions); and a carer behaviour screen of five domains characteristic of frontotemporal dementia (ftd). data from healthy controls produced abnormality cut-offs of 77/100 als-specific score; 24/36 als non-specific score; 105/136 ecas total. twenty-nine percent of patients showed abnormal als-specific scores, and 6% also showed abnormal als non-specific scores. the most prevalent deficit occurred in language functions (35%) followed by executive functions and fluency (23% each). forty percent of carers reported behaviour change in at least one domain, while 15% met criteria for possible ftd. in conclusion, the ecas is an effective within-clinic assessment for als that determines the presence, severity and type of cognitive and/or behavioural changes, an essential first step to managing these symptoms.
the social environment has potent effects on individual phenotype and fitness in group-living species. we asked whether the presence of kin might act on energy allocation, a central aspect of life-history variation. using a 22-year data set on reproductive and somatic allocations in columbian ground squirrels (urocitellus columbianus), we tested the effects of co-breeding and non-breeding kin on the fitness and energy allocation balance between reproduction and personal body condition of individual females. greater numbers of co-breeding kin had a positive effect on the number of offspring weaned, through the mechanism of altering energy allocation patterns. on average, females with higher numbers of co-breeding kin did not increase energy income but biased energy allocation towards reproduction. co-breeding female kin ground squirrels maintain close nest burrows, likely providing a social buffer against territorial invasions from non-kin ground squirrels. lower aggressiveness, lower risks of infanticide from female kin and greater protection of territorial boundaries may allow individual females to derive net fitness benefits via their energy allocation strategies. we demonstrated the importance of kin effects on a fundamental life-history trade-off.  since w. d. hamilton's seminal work on the evolution of sociality, a large body of research has accumulated on how kin selection might explain the evolution of cooperation in many group-living species. our study examined the evolutionary basis of philopatry and cooperation; specifically, whether individuals benefit from the presence of close kin. we applied an individual fitness approach to a 16-year study of columbian ground squirrels (urocitellus columbianus) to investigate potential causal paths by which the presence of kin might act on individual fitness. our results indicate that individual fitness benefits resulted from associations of philopatric female kin, and support the hypothesis that increased tolerance of proximity of kin is a proximate mechanism for these benefits. the major life-history influence of kin on individual fitness was through improved reproductive success, and this benefit may have been owing to philopatric settlement of kin that were recognized through familiarization in the natal burrow. thus, we demonstrated an evolutionary basis necessary for ongoing kin-selected cooperation in columbian ground squirrels, though the mechanism of familiarity may determine which kin individuals benefit from cooperative behaviours.
it is difficult to measure rotational eye movement constantly from "almost black eyeball image" acquired under the condition that the brightness of an image content being watched by a user is very low or the condition that almost no light is irradiated from its surrounding environment. to solve this problem, the authors developed a new method for measuring rotational eye movement at high accuracy by enhancing the contrast in the image of the vessels on the white of the eyeball, with small blue led light irradiation as auxiliary light. in our evaluation experiment, the images of rotational eye movements were captured, and data on the vessel positions were obtained by both visual measurement and this system to evaluate the estimated error and processing speed. the result suggests that our proposed system is capable of measuring rotational eye movement with an average of estimated errors equal to or lower than 0.24 degrees, even with almost black eyeball image.  algorithms developed by the author for recognizing persons by their iris patterns have now been tested in many field and laboratory trials, producing no false matches in several million comparison tests. the recognition principle is the failure of a test of statistical independence on iris phase structure encoded by multi-scale quadrature wavelets. the combinatorial complexity of this phase information across different persons spans about 249 degrees of freedom and generates a discrimination entropy of about 3.2 b/mm/sup 2/ over the iris, enabling real-time decisions about personal identity with extremely high confidence. the high confidence levels are important because they allow very large databases to be searched exhaustively (one-to-many "identification mode") without making false matches, despite so many chances. biometrics that lack this property can only survive one-to-one ("verification") or few comparisons. the paper explains the iris recognition algorithms and presents results of 9.1 million comparisons among eye images from trials in britain, the usa, japan, and korea.
objectives many diagnostic studies are aimed at defining "optimal" thresholds. here, we evaluate the performance of empirically defined optimal thresholds (1) in the sample in which they were defined and (2) in the population from which the sample was drawn.   study design and setting we simulated test results for 120,000 samples varying the number of people without a disease (n between 20 and 500), number of people with a disease (m between 20 and 500), the magnitude of the difference between group means [effect size (es) between 0.5 and 4], and distributions (normal and log-normal). the thresholds associated with the maximal youden index were defined as optimal. performance was defined as the percentage of correct classifications in the sample and when applied to the whole population.   results at the population level, the thresholds defined for the four ess (0.5, 0.8, 2, and 4) yielded a median of 59%, 65%, 83%, and 97% correct classifications, respectively. at the sample level, the samples with similar characteristics yielded widely varying estimates of the performance that were systematically higher than at the population level.   conclusion researchers need to be careful defining cut points for mean differences that are traditionally considered "large" (es = 0.8). the diagnostic utility of optimal thresholds needs to be assessed in prospective studies.  when investigating the effects of potential prognostic or risk factors that have been measured on a quantitative scale, values of these factors are often categorized into two groups. sometimes an 'optimal' cutpoint is chosen that gives the best separation in terms of a two-sample test statistic. it is well known that this approach leads to a serious inflation of the type i error and to an overestimation of the effect of the prognostic or risk factor in absolute terms. in this paper, we illustrate that the resulting confidence intervals are similarly affected. we show that the application of a shrinkage procedure to correct for bias, together with bootstrap resampling for estimating the variance, yields confidence intervals for the effect of a potential prognostic or risk factor with the desired coverage.
one of the central questions in invasion biology involves why some introductions succeed and others fail. although several correlates of invasion success have been identified, patterns alone cannot identify the mechanisms underlying the invasion process. here, we test the hypothesis that one predictor of invasion success, behavioral flexibility, is different between invading and established populations of the same species of bird. we predicted that neophobia (fear of novelty), a surrogate of behavioral flexibility, would be weaker in an actively invading population (28 years resident; colon, republic of panama) of house sparrows (passer domesticus) compared to a population that had been resident for more than 150 years (princeton, new jersey, usa). to test this hypothesis, we compared latency to consume novel foods and phobia of novel objects between populations when both were kept under similar environmental conditions in captivity. as predicted, birds from the 150-year-old population took significantly longer to approach and consume novel foods than birds from the 28-year-old population. responses to novel objects were not different between populations however; both populations fed more readily near some novel objects, which to our knowledge is the first such occurrence in a wild vertebrate species. overall, a predilection for trying new foods and being attracted to novel objects may in part explain how this species has so successfully invaded new areas. copyright 2005.  biotic invaders are species that establish a new range in which they proliferate, spread, and persist to the detriment of the environment. they are the most important ecological outcomes from the unprecedented alterations in the distribution of the earth's biota brought about largely through human transport and commerce. in a world without borders, few if any areas remain sheltered from these im- migrations. the fate of immigrants is decidedly mixed. few survive the hazards of chronic and stochastic forces, and only a small fraction become naturalized. in turn, some naturalized species do become invasive. there are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites; others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native communities. ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and uncontrollable. whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) animal invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing, competition, and habitat alteration. (2) plant invaders can completely alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival of native species. (3) in agriculture, the principal pests of temperate crops are nonindigenous, and the combined expenses of pest control and crop losses constitute an onerous "tax" on food, fiber, and forage production. (4) the global cost of virulent plant and animal diseases caused by parasites transported to new ranges and presented with susceptible new hosts is currently incalculable. identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their dispersal and establishment con- stitutes an enormous challenge to both conservation and international commerce. detection and management when exclusion fails have proved daunting for varied reasons: (1) efforts to identify general attributes of future invaders have often been inconclusive. (2) predicting susceptible locales for future invasions seems even more problematic, given the enormous differences in the rates of arrival among potential invaders. (3) eradication of an established invader is rare, and control efforts vary enormously in their efficacy. successful control, however, depends more on commitment and continuing diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools themselves. (4) control of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a long-term, ecosystem- wide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on battling individual invaders. (5) prevention of invasions is much less costly than post-entry control. revamping national and international quarantine laws by adopting a "guilty until proven innocent" approach would be a productive first step. failure to address the issue of biotic invasions could effectively result in severe global consequences, including wholesale loss of agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources in some regions, disruption of the ecological processes that supply natural services on which human enterprise depends, and the creation of homogeneous, impoverished ecosystems composed of cosmopolitan species. given their current scale, biotic invasions have taken their place alongside human-driven atmospheric and oceanic alterations as major agents of global change. left unchecked, they will influence these other forces in profound but still unpredictable ways.
deadlocks in the or request model are usually resolved by aborting a deadlocked process. the work done by the aborted process is wasted. therefore, the throughput of a system could be improved ensuring that deadlock resolution algorithms do not cause false deadlock resolutions. this paper presents the performance evaluation of a safe-deadlock resolution algorithm, which has a theoretical communication cost similar to other safe-detection algorithms (which do not consider explicitly deadlock resolution).  the author describes a series of deadlock detection techniques based on centralized, hierarchical, and distributed control organizations. the point of view is that of practical implications. an up-to-date and comprehensive survey of deadlock detection algorithms is presented, their merits and drawbacks are discussed, and their performances (delays as well as message complexity) are compared. related issues such as correctness of the algorithms, performance of the algorithms, and deadlock resolution, which require further research are examined.<<etx>>
abstract natural thermal insulation materials developed from renewable crop by-products and natural binders are analysed in terms of their thermal degradation and fire behaviour. a pyrolysis combustion flow calorimetre (pcfc) is used to characterise some kinds of crop by-products, including rice husk, corn pith and barley straw. this technique is complemented with a tg analysis. six thermal insulation materials, formulated with such crop by-products and two kind of natural binders, corn starch and sodium alginate, are developed and analysed. pcfc results show an improvement when sodium alginate is incorporated, especially in the corn pith composite. fire reaction tests are also performed that yield results which are in qualitative agreement with the small-scale tests.  abstract dynamic tg analysis under nitrogen was used to investigate the thermal decomposition processes of 10 types of natural fibers commonly used in the polymer composite industry. these fibers included wood, bamboo, agricultural residue, and bast fibers. various degradation models including the kissinger, friedman, flynn–wall–ozawa, and modified coats–redfern methods were used to determine the apparent activation energy of these fibers. for most natural fibers approximately 60% of the thermal decomposition occurred within a temperature range between 215 and 310 °c. the result also showed that an apparent activation energy of 160–170 kj/mol was obtained for most of the selected fibers throughout the polymer processing temperature range. these activation energy values allow developing a simplified approach to understand the thermal decomposition behavior of natural fibers as a function of polymer composite processing.
it has now become accepted that the immune system and neuroendocrine system form an integrated part of our physiology. immunological defense mechanisms act in concert with physiological processes like growth and reproduction, energy intake and metabolism, as well as neuronal development. not only are psychological and environmental stressors communicated to the immune system, but also, vice versa, the immune response and adaptation to a current pathogen challenge are communicated to the entire body, including the brain, to evoke adaptive responses (e.g., fever, sickness behavior) that ensure allocation of energy to fight the pathogen. this phenomenon is evolutionarily conserved. hence it is both interesting and important to consider the evolutionary history of this bi-directional neuroendocrine-immune communication to reveal phylogenetically ancient or relatively recently acquired mechanisms. indeed, such considerations have already disclosed an extensive "common vocabulary" of information pathways as well as molecules and their receptors used by both the neuroendocrine and immune systems. this review focuses on the principal mechanisms of bi-directional communication and the evidence for evolutionary conservation of the important physiological pathways involved.  parent-offspring conflicts lead the offspring to evolve reliable signals of individual quality, including parasite burden, which may allow parents to adaptively modulate investment in the progeny. sex-related variation in offspring reproductive value, however, may entail differential investment in sons and daughters. here, we experimentally manipulated offspring condition in the barn swallow (hirundo rustica) by subjecting nestlings to an immune challenge (injection with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, lps) that simulates a bacterial infection, and assessed the effects on growth, feather quality, expression of morphological (gape coloration) and behavioral (posture) begging displays involved in parent-offspring communication, as well as on food allocation by parents. compared to sham-injected controls, lps-treated chicks suffered a depression of body mass and a reduction of palate color saturation. in addition, lps treatment resulted in lower feather quality, with an increase in the occurrence of fault bars on wing feathers. the color of beak flanges, feather growth and the intensity of postural begging were affected by lps treatment only in females, suggesting that chicks of either sex are differently susceptible to the immune challenge. however, irrespective of the effects of lps, parents equally allocated food among control and challenged offspring both under normal food provisioning and after a short period of food deprivation of the chicks. these results indicate that bacterial infection and the associated immune response entail different costs to offspring of either sex, but a decrease in nestling conditions does not affect parental care allocation, possibly because the barn swallow adopts a brood-survival strategy. finally, we showed that physiological stress induced by pathogens impairs plumage quality, a previously neglected major negative impact of bacterial infection which could severely affect fitness, particularly among long-distance migratory birds.
enhancing the specificity of the spins' excitation can improve the capabilities of magnetic resonance. exciting voxels with tailored 3d shapes reduces partial volume effects and enhances contrast, particularly in cases where cubic voxels or other simple geometries do not provide an optimal localization. spatial excitation profiles of arbitrary shapes can be implemented using so-called multidimensional rf pulses, which are often limited in practice to 2d implementations owing to their sensitivity to field inhomogeneities. recent work has shown the potential of spatio-temporally encoded (spen) pulses towards alleviating these constraints. in particular, 2d pulses operating in a so-called hybrid scheme where the "low-bandwidth" spatial dimension is sculpted by a spen strategy while an orthogonal axis is shaped by regular k-space encoding, have been shown resilient to chemical shift and b0 field inhomogeneities. in this work we explore the use of pairs of 2d pulses, with one of these addressing geometries in the x-y plane and the other in the x-z dimension, to sculpt complex 3d volumes in phantoms and in vivo. to overcome limitations caused by the rf discretization demanded by these 2d pulses, a number of "unfolding" techniques yielding images from the centerband rf excitation while deleting sideband contributions - even in cases where center- and side-bands severely overlap - were developed. thus it was possible to increase the gradient strengths applied along the low bandwidth dimensions, significantly improving the robustness of this kind of 3d sculpting pulses. comparisons against conventional pulses designed on the basis of pure k-space trajectories, are presented.  the understanding and control of spin dynamics play a fundamental role in modern nmr imaging, for devising new ways to monitor an object's density as well as for enabling the tailored excitation of spins in space. it has recently been shown that by relying on spatiotemporal encoding (spen), new forms of single-scan multidimensional nmr spectroscopy and imaging become feasible. the present study extends those imaging developments, by introducing a new class of multidimensional excitation pulses that relies on spen concepts. we focus in particular on a family of "hybrid" 2d radiofrequency (rf) pulses that operate in both direct and reciprocal excitation space, and which can spatially sculpt the spin magnetization in manners that are beyond the reach of sequential 1d pulse shaping. these spen-based 2d pulses are compatible with a majority of single- and multi-scan imaging techniques. like the corresponding spen-based hybrid 2d acquisitions, these pulses can benefit from a high robustness against field inhomogeneities and/or offset effects that affect their k-space-based counterparts. these properties are analyzed, and illustrated with numerical simulations and model experiments.
a localized modulated radiation force can be produced when two confocal ultrasound beams of nearly equal frequencies interfere in an attenuating medium such as tissue. it is well-established that this force generates both shear and longitudinal waves. by scanning the focal point over a plane and observing the propagation of these waves, the mechanical properties of the medium can be imaged. in this paper, the modulated radiation force is analytically derived in the case of attenuating media, by expanding on the theory of ultrasound-stimulated-vibro-acoustography (usva) for lossless media. furthermore, weak nonlinearities are considered in the formulation, since higher source pressures may prove to be necessary to improve the radiation-force profile - only the fundamental component is, however, studied in this paper. an analysis of the generated radiation force is performed and the effects of various parameters are investigated on its amplitude and spatial distribution. it will be shown that by carefully selecting the confocal geometry of the beams, as well as, the source pressure and center frequency, the spatial profile of the radiation force can be optimized. this, subsequently, could improve not only the resolution of the point-spread-function in usva, but also, the profile of the shear waves in elastography applications.  we describe theoretical principles of an imaging modality that uses the acoustic response of an object to a highly localized dynamic radiation force of an ultrasound field. in this method, named ultrasound-stimulated vibro-acoustography (usva), ultrasound is used to exert a low-frequency (in khz range) force on the object. in response, a portion of the object vibrates sinusoidally in a pattern determined by its viscoelastic properties. the acoustic emission field resulting from object vibration is detected and used to form an image that represents both the ultrasonic and low-frequency (khz range) mechanical characteristics of the object. we report the relation between the emitted acoustic field and the incident ultrasonic pressure field in terms of object parameters. also, we present the point-spread function of the imaging system. the experimental images in this report have a resolution of about 700 microm, high contrast, and high signal-to-noise ratio. usva is sensitive enough to detect object motions on the order of nanometers. possible applications include medical imaging and material evaluation.
many problems in machine learning involve calculating correspondences between sets of objects, such as point clouds or images. discrete optimal transport provides a natural and successful approach to such tasks whenever the two sets of objects can be represented in the same space, or at least distances between them can be directly evaluated. unfortunately neither requirement is likely to hold when object representations are learned from data. indeed, automatically derived representations such as word embeddings are typically fixed only up to some global transformations, for example, reflection or rotation. as a result, pairwise distances across two such instances are ill-defined without specifying their relative transformation. in this work, we propose a general framework for optimal transport in the presence of latent global transformations. we cast the problem as a joint optimization over transport couplings and transformations chosen from a flexible class of invariances, propose algorithms to solve it, and show promising results in various tasks, including a popular unsupervised word translation benchmark.  state-of-the-art methods for learning cross-lingual word embeddings have relied on bilingual dictionaries or parallel corpora. recent studies showed that the need for parallel data supervision can be alleviated with character-level information. while these methods showed encouraging results, they are not on par with their supervised counterparts and are limited to pairs of languages sharing a common alphabet. in this work, we show that we can build a bilingual dictionary between two languages without using any parallel corpora, by aligning monolingual word embedding spaces in an unsupervised way. without using any character information, our model even outperforms existing supervised methods on cross-lingual tasks for some language pairs. our experiments demonstrate that our method works very well also for distant language pairs, like english-russian or english-chinese. we finally describe experiments on the english-esperanto low-resource language pair, on which there only exists a limited amount of parallel data, to show the potential impact of our method in fully unsupervised machine translation. our code, embeddings and dictionaries are publicly available.
we believe that humanoid robots provide new tools to investigate human social cognition, the processes underlying everyday interactions between individuals. resonance is an emerging framework to understand social interactions that is based on the finding that cognitive processes involved when experiencing a mental state and when perceiving another individual experiencing the same mental state overlap, both at the behavioral and neural levels. we will first review important aspects of his framework. in a second part, we will discuss how this framework is used to address questions pertaining to artificial agents' social competence. we will focus on two types of paradigm, one derived from experimental psychology and the other using neuroimaging, that have been used to investigate humans' responses to humanoid robots. finally, we will speculate on the consequences of resonance in natural social interactions if humanoid robots are to become integral part of our societies.  this paper presents a 50-d.o.f. humanoid robot, computational brain (cb). cb is a humanoid robot created for exploring the underlying processing of the human brain while dealing with the real world. we place our investigations within real—world contexts, as humans do. in so doing, we focus on utilizing a system that is closer to humans—in sensing, kinematics configuration and performance. we present the real-time network-based architecture for the control of all 50 d.o.f. the controller provides full position/velocity/force sensing and control at 1 khz, allowing us the flexibility in deriving various forms of control. a dynamic simulator is also presented; the simulator acts as a realistic testbed for our controllers and acts as a common interface to our humanoid robots. a contact model developed to allow better validation of our controllers prior to final testing on the physical robot is also presented. three aspects of the system are highlighted in this paper: (i) physical power for walking, (ii) full-body compliant control—physical interactions and (iii) perception and control—visual ocular-motor responses.
event related fmri was used to investigate age-related changes in bold activity during the execution of right hand finger movements in internally or externally guided tasks. all of the younger adults exhibited typical (positive) bold responses in supplementary motor areas (sma) bilaterally, and in the left sensorimotor cortex. negative bold responses were found, however, in the right sensorimotor cortex of the younger adults. in contrast, all but one of the older adults had positive bold responses in sma and sensorimotor cortex of both hemispheres. across both tasks, older adults showed increased activity (relative to younger adults) in right ventrolateral premotor and medial premotor areas, but more so during the internally guided task. overall, these results suggest age-related changes in motor control. the younger adults’ hemispheric asymmetry and the lack thereof in older adults suggest a fundamental change in interhemispheric communication as part of the normal aging process.  we investigate age- and expertise-related individual differences in component processes of rhythmic timing. to this end we apply analysis of covariance structure and symbolic dynamics to time series obtained from performances of two bimanual rhythm tasks at different tempos. results show similar effects for peripheral motor implementation and timekeeper execution in young and older amateur pianists. older participants show specific problems with temporal sequencing processes (specification of different target intervals). expert pianists show lower variability in both motor implementation and timekeeper execution and they accommodate to the sequencing demands of different tempos by selectively relying on integrated or parallel timing. we argue that the observed timing control characteristics reflect individuals' adaptations to internal processing limitations and performance constraints.
recombination rates vary in intensity and location at the species, individual, sex and chromosome levels. despite the fundamental biological importance of this process, the selective forces that operate to shape recombination rate and patterns are unclear. domestication offers a unique opportunity to study the interplay between recombination and selection. in domesticates, intense selection for particular traits is imposed on small populations over many generations, resulting in organisms that differ, sometimes dramatically, in morphology and physiology from their wild ancestor. although earlier studies suggested increased recombination rate in domesticates, a formal comparison of recombination rates between domestic mammals and their wild congeners was missing. in order to determine broad-scale recombination rate, we used immunolabeling detection of mlh1 foci as crossover markers in spermatocytes in three pairs of closely related wild and domestic species (dog and wolf, goat and ibex, and sheep and mouflon). in the three pairs, and contrary to previous suggestions, our data show that contemporary recombination rate is higher in the wild species. subsequently, we inferred recombination breakpoints in sequence data for 16 genomic regions in dogs and wolves, each containing a locus associated with a dog phenotype potentially under selection during domestication. no difference in the number and distribution of recombination breakpoints was found between dogs and wolves. we conclude that our data indicate that strong directional selection did not result in changes in recombination in domestic mammals, and that both upper and lower bounds for crossover rates may be tightly regulated.  analysis of diverse eukaryotes has revealed that recombination events cluster in discrete genomic locations known as hotspots. in humans, a zinc-finger protein, prdm9, is believed to initiate recombination in >40% of hotspots by binding to a specific dna sequence motif. however, the prdm9 coding sequence is disrupted in the dog genome assembly, raising questions regarding the nature and control of recombination in dogs. by analyzing the sequences of prdm9 orthologs in a number of dog breeds and several carnivores, we show here that this gene was inactivated early in canid evolution. we next use patterns of linkage disequilibrium using more than 170,000 snp markers typed in almost 500 dogs to estimate the recombination rates in the dog genome using a coalescent-based approach. broad-scale recombination rates show good correspondence with an existing linkage-based map. significant variation in recombination rate is observed on the fine scale, and we are able to detect over 4000 recombination hotspots with high confidence. in contrast to human hotspots, 40% of canine hotspots are characterized by a distinct peak in gc content. a comparative genomic analysis indicates that these peaks are present also as weaker peaks in the panda, suggesting that the hotspots have been continually reinforced by accelerated and strongly gc biased nucleotide substitutions, consistent with the long-term action of biased gene conversion on the dog lineage. these results are consistent with the loss of prdm9 in canids, resulting in a greater evolutionary stability of recombination hotspots. the genetic determinants of recombination hotspots in the dog genome may thus reflect a fundamental process of relevance to diverse animal species.
within the mitotic spindle, specific interactions between microtubules, chromosomes and numerous accessory proteins allow the generation of spatially regulated forces that bring about accurate chromosome segregation. generation of this proper spatial regulation requires that individual proteins be targeted to specific substructures within the spindle. for example, the kinesin-related protein cenp-e is targeted specifically to the corona fibers of kinetochores (yao et al., 1997) where its action is required during alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate (schaar et al., 1997; wood et al., 1997). in contrast, the protein numa (nuclear mitotic antigen) is concentrated at spindle poles where its activity appears to be required for the focused organization of microtubules (gaglio et al., 1995). the vertebrate mitotic spindle pole is a microtubuledependent region surrounding the centrioles and centrosome at each of the two ends of the bipolar mitotic spindle. numa, γtubulin and katanin are proteins whose localization define the spindle pole. numa associates exclusively with the microtubule-dependent spindle pole during mitosis and does not associate with interphase centrosomes (price and pettijohn, 1986; dionne et al., 1999). in contrast, localization of γ-tubulin to the interphase or mitotic centrosome does not require intact microtubules (khodjakov and rieder, 1999; stearns et al., 1991; zheng et al., 1991). however, localization of additional γ-tubulin that surrounds the centrosomes only during mitosis does require microtubules (mcnally and thomas, 1998; khodjakov and rieder, 1999). like numa, the sea urchin protein, katanin, is concentrated in a microtubule-dependent structure surrounding the γ-tubulin at the poles of embryonic spindles (mcnally et al., 1996). antibodies recognizing mammalian homologs of katanin also recognize large microtubule-dependent structures surrounding γ-tubulin foci at spindle poles in several cell types and, in addition, recognize a smaller microtubule-independent focus at the centrosome in some cell types (mcnally and thomas, 1998). sea urchin katanin severs microtubules in an atp-dependent manner in vitro (mcnally and vale, 1993) and is thought to be important in releasing microtubules from their centrosomal attachment points in vivo. indeed, microinjection of antibodies recognizing a vertebrate katanin homolog into neurons results in the accumulation of microtubules attached to the centrosome (ahmad et al., 1999), indicating that katanin-mediated microtubule severing is responsible for the release of microtubules from the neuronal centrosome. the concentration of katanin in mitotic spindle poles (mcnally and thomas, 1998) and the specific activation of katanin’s activity in mphase xenopus extracts (vale, 1991; mcnally and thomas, 1998) suggest that katanin may also sever microtubules from their centrosomal attachments during mitosis in non-neuronal cells. katanin’s localization in spindle poles may increase the efficiency of this centrosomal release reaction and thus allow 1623 journal of cell science 113, 1623-1633 (2000) printed in great britain © the company of biologists limited 2000 jcs1028  microtubules are dynamic structures whose proper rearrangement during the cell cycle is essential for the positioning of membranes during interphase and for chromosome segregation during mitosis. the previous discovery of a cyclin b/cdc2-activated microtubule-severing activity in m-phase xenopus egg extracts suggested that a microtubule-severing protein might play an important role in cell cycle-dependent changes in microtubule dynamics and organization. however, the isolation of three different microtubule-severing proteins, p56, ef1alpha, and katanin, has only confused the issue because none of these proteins is directly activated by cyclin b/cdc2. here we use immunodepletion with antibodies specific for a vertebrate katanin homologue to demonstrate that katanin is responsible for the majority of m-phase severing activity in xenopus eggs. this result suggests that katanin is responsible for changes in microtubules occurring at mitosis. immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that katanin is concentrated at a microtubule-dependent structure at mitotic spindle poles in xenopus a6 cells and in human fibroblasts, suggesting a specific role in microtubule disassembly at spindle poles. surprisingly, katanin was also found in adult mouse brain, indicating that katanin may have other functions distinct from its mitotic role.
we performed a systematic review of the behavioral lifestyle intervention trials conducted in the united states published between 1990 and 2011 that included a maintenance phase of at least six months, to identify intervention features that promote weight loss maintenance in african american women. seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. generally, african american women lost less weight during the intensive weight loss phase and maintained a lower % of their weight loss compared to caucasian women. the majority of studies failed to describe the specific strategies used in the delivery of the maintenance intervention, adherence to those strategies, and did not incorporate a maintenance phase process evaluation making it difficult to identify intervention characteristics associated with better weight loss maintenance. however, the inclusion of cultural adaptations, particularly in studies with a mixed ethnicity/race sample, resulted in less % weight regain for african american women. studies with a formal maintenance intervention and weight management as the primary intervention focus reported more positive weight maintenance outcomes for african american women. nonetheless, our results present both the difficulty in weight loss and maintenance experienced by african american women in behavioral lifestyle interventions.  context behavioral weight loss interventions achieve short-term success, but re-gain is common.   objective to compare 2 weight loss maintenance interventions with a self-directed control group.   design, setting, and participants two-phase trial in which 1032 overweight or obese adults (38% african american, 63% women) with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or both who had lost at least 4 kg during a 6-month weight loss program (phase 1) were randomized to a weight-loss maintenance intervention (phase 2). enrollment at 4 academic centers occurred august 2003-july 2004 and randomization, february-december 2004. data collection was completed in june 2007.   interventions after the phase 1 weight-loss program, participants were randomized to one of the following groups for 30 months: monthly personal contact, unlimited access to an interactive technology-based intervention, or self-directed control. main outcome changes in weight from randomization.   results mean entry weight was 96.7 kg. during the initial 6-month program, mean weight loss was 8.5 kg. after randomization, weight regain occurred. participants in the personal-contact group regained less weight (4.0 kg) than those in the self-directed group (5.5 kg; mean difference at 30 months, -1.5 kg; 95% confidence interval [ci], -2.4 to -0.6 kg; p = .001). at 30 months, weight regain did not differ between the interactive technology-based (5.2 kg) and self-directed groups (5.5 kg; mean difference -0.3 kg; 95% ci, -1.2 to 0.6 kg; p = .51); however, weight regain was lower in the interactive technology-based than in the self-directed group at 18 months (mean difference, -1.1 kg; 95% ci, -1.9 to -0.4 kg; p = .003) and at 24 months (mean difference, -0.9 kg; 95% ci, -1.7 to -0.02 kg; p = .04). at 30 months, the difference between the personal-contact and interactive technology-based group was -1.2 kg (95% ci -2.1 to -0.3; p = .008). effects did not differ significantly by sex, race, age, and body mass index subgroups. overall, 71% of study participants remained below entry weight.   conclusions the majority of individuals who successfully completed an initial behavioral weight loss program maintained a weight below their initial level. monthly brief personal contact provided modest benefit in sustaining weight loss, whereas an interactive technology-based intervention provided early but transient benefit.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct00054925.
objective: the literature suggests that colorectal cancer mortality in texas is distributed inhomogeneously among specific demographic subgroups and in certain geographic regions over an extended period. to understand the extent of the demographic and geographic disparities, the present study examined colorectal cancer mortality in 15 demographic groups in texas counties between 1990 and 2001. methods: the spatial scan statistic was used to assess the standardized mortality ratio, duration and age-adjusted rates of excess mortality, and their respective p-values for testing the null hypothesis of homogeneity of geographic and temporal distribution. results: the study confirmed the excess mortality in some texas counties found in the literature, identified 13 additional excess mortality regions, and found 4 health regions with persistent excess mortality involving several population subgroups. conclusion: health disparities of colorectal cancer mortality continue to exist in texas demographic subpopulations. health education and intervention programs should be directed to the at-risk subpopulations in the identified regions.  both statistical ecology and environmental statistics have numerous challenges and opportunities in the waiting for the twenty-first century, calling for increasing numbers of nontraditional statistical approaches. both theoretical and applied ecology are using advancing data analytical and interpretational software and hardware to satisfy public policy and discovery research, variously incorporating geospatial information, site-specific data and remote sensing imagery. we discuss a declared need for geoinformatic surveillance for spatial critical area detection. we explore, for ecological and environmental use, an innovation of the circle-based spatial scan statistic popular in the health sciences.
this paper reports a novel deep architecture referred to as maxout network in network (min), which can enhance model discriminability and facilitate the process of information abstraction within the receptive field. the proposed network adopts the framework of the recently developed network in network structure, which slides a universal approximator, multilayer perceptron (mlp) with rectifier units, to exact features. instead of mlp, we employ maxout mlp to learn a variety of piecewise linear activation functions and to mediate the problem of vanishing gradients that can occur when using rectifier units. moreover, batch normalization is applied to reduce the saturation of maxout units by pre-conditioning the model and dropout is applied to prevent overfitting. finally, average pooling is used in all pooling layers to regularize maxout mlp in order to facilitate information abstraction in every receptive field while tolerating the change of object position. because average pooling preserves all features in the local patch, the proposed min model can enforce the suppression of irrelevant information during training. our experiments demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performance when the min model was applied to mnist, cifar-10, and cifar-100 datasets and comparable performance for svhn dataset.  we consider the problem of designing models to leverage a recently introduced approximate model averaging technique called dropout. we define a simple new model called maxout (so named because its output is the max of a set of inputs, and because it is a natural companion to dropout) designed to both facilitate optimization by dropout and improve the accuracy of dropout's fast approximate model averaging technique. we empirically verify that the model successfully accomplishes both of these tasks. we use maxout and dropout to demonstrate state of the art classification performance on four benchmark datasets: mnist, cifar-10, cifar-100, and svhn.
backgroundv(d)j recombination is initiated in antigen receptor loci by the pairwise cleavage of recombination signal sequences (rsss) by the rag1 and rag2 proteins via a nick-hairpin mechanism. the rss contains highly conserved heptamer (consensus: 5'-cacagtg) and nonamer (consensus: 5'-acaaaaacc) motifs separated by either 12- or 23-base pairs of poorly conserved sequence. the high mobility group proteins hmgb1 and hmgb2 (hmgb1/2) are highly abundant architectural dna binding proteins known to promote rag-mediated synapsis and cleavage of consensus recombination signals in vitro by facilitating rss binding and bending by the rag1/2 complex. hmgb1/2 are known to recognize distorted dna structures such as four-way junctions, and damaged or modified dna. whether hmgb1/2 can promote rag-mediated dna cleavage at sites lacking a canonical rss by targeting or stabilizing structural distortions is unclear, but is important for understanding the etiology of chromosomal translocations involving antigen receptor genes and proto-oncogene sequences that do not contain an obvious rss-like element.resultshere we identify a novel dna breakpoint site in the plasmid v(d)j recombination substrate pgg49 (bps6197) that is cleaved by the rag proteins via a nick-hairpin mechanism. the bps6197 sequence lacks a recognizable heptamer at the breakpoint (5'-cctgacg-3') but contains a nonamer-like element (5'-acattaacc-3') 30 base pairs from the cleavage site. we find that rag-mediated bps6197 cleavage is promoted by hmgb1/2, requiring both hmg-box domains to be intact to facilitate rag-mediated cleavage, and is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-rss. a dyad-symmetric inverted repeat sequence lying 5' to the breakpoint is implicated as a target for hmgb1/2 activity.conclusionwe have identified a novel dna sequence, called bps6197, that supports standard v(d)j-type cleavage despite the absence of an apparent heptamer motif. efficient rag-mediated bps6197 cleavage requires the presence of hmgb1/2, is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-rss partner, and is directed in part by an inverted repeat sequence adjacent to the dna cleavage site. these results have important implications for understanding how the rag proteins can introduce a dna double-strand break at dna sequences that do not contain an obvious heptamer-like motif.  v(d)j recombination is a process integral to lymphocyte development. however, this process is not always benign, since certain lymphoid malignancies exhibit recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations and deletions, that harbor molecular signatures suggesting an origin from aberrant v(d)j recombination. translocations involving lmo2, tal1, ttg-1, and hox11, as well as a recurrent interstitial deletion at 1p32 involving sil/scl, are cited examples of illegitimate v(d)j recombination. previous studies using extrachromosomal substrates reveal that cryptic recombination signal sequences (crsss) identified near the translocation breakpoint in these examples support v(d)j recombination with efficiencies ranging from about 30- to 20,000-fold less than bona fide v(d)j recombination signals. to understand the molecular basis for these large differences, we investigated the binding and cleavage of these crsss by the rag1/2 proteins that initiate v(d)j recombination. we find that the rag proteins comparably bind all crsss tested, albeit more poorly than a consensus rss. we show that four crsss that support levels of v(d)j recombination above background levels in cell culture (lmo2, tal1, ttg-1, and sil) are also cleaved by the rag proteins in vitro with efficiencies ranging from 18 to 70% of a consensus rss. cleavage of lmo2 and ttg-1 by the rag proteins can also be detected in cell culture using ligation-mediated pcr. in contrast, hox11 and scl are nicked but not cleaved efficiently in vitro, and cleavage at other adventitious sites in plasmid substrates may also limit the ability to detect recombination activity at these crsss in cell culture.
integrating large-scale functional genomic data has significantly accelerated our understanding of gene functions. however, no algorithm has been developed to differentiate functions for isoforms of the same gene using high-throughput genomic data. this is because standard supervised learning requires ‘ground-truth’ functional annotations, which are lacking at the isoform level. to address this challenge, we developed a generic framework that interrogates public rna-seq data at the transcript level to differentiate functions for alternatively spliced isoforms. for a specific function, our algorithm identifies the ‘responsible’ isoform(s) of a gene and generates classifying models at the isoform level instead of at the gene level. through cross-validation, we demonstrated that our algorithm is effective in assigning functions to genes, especially the ones with multiple isoforms, and robust to gene expression levels and removal of homologous gene pairs. we identified genes in the mouse whose isoforms are predicted to have disparate functionalities and experimentally validated the ‘responsible’ isoforms using data from mammary tissue. with protein structure modeling and experimental evidence, we further validated the predicted isoform functional differences for the genes cdkn2a and anxa6. our generic framework is the first to predict and differentiate functions for alternatively spliced isoforms, instead of genes, using genomic data. it is extendable to any base machine learner and other species with alternatively spliced isoforms, and shifts the current gene-centered function prediction to isoform-level predictions.  in pattern classification it is usually assumed that a training set of labeled patterns is available. multiple-instance learning (mil) generalizes this problem setting by making weaker assumptions about the labeling information. while each pattern is still believed to possess a true label, training labels are associated with sets or bags of patterns rather than individual patterns. more formally, given is a set of patterns x1, ...,xn grouped into bags x1, ..., xm, with xj = {xi : i ∈ ij} and ij ⊆ {1, ..., n}. with each bag xj is associated a label yj ∈ {−1, 1}. these labels are interpreted in the following way: if a bag has a negative label yj = −1, all patterns in that bag inherit the negative label. if on the other hand, yj = 1, then at least one pattern xi ∈ xj is a positive example of the underlying concept. the mil scenario has many interesting applications: one prominent application is the classification of molecules in the context of drug design (dietterich, lathrop, & lozanoperez 1997). here, each molecule is represented by a bag of possible conformations. another application is in image retrieval where images can be viewed as bags of local image patches (maron & ratan 1998) or image regions. algorithms for the mil problem were first presented in (dietterich, lathrop, & lozano-perez 1997; auer 1997; long & tan 1996). these methods (and analytical results) are based on hypothesis classes consisting of axisaligned rectangles. similarly, methods developed subsequently (e.g., (maron & lozano-perez 1998; zhang & goldman 2002)) have focused on specially tailored machine learning algorithms that do not compare favorably in the limiting case of bags of size 1 (the standard classification setting). a notable exception is (ramon & raedt 2000).
monitoring changes on earth's surface is a difficult task commonly performed using multi-spectral remote sensing. the increasing availability of remote sensing platforms providing data makes multi-source approaches promising, since it can increase temporal revisit rate. however, digital image processing techniques are needed to integrate the data, since sensors can be quite different in terms of acquisition characteristics. this work addresses the spectral normalizing of three medium spatial resolution sensors: landsat8/oli, landsat-7/etm+ and cbers-4/mux, through linear regression and linear mixture model approaches. the results showed slight better results when using the linear regression approach.  satellite image time series are becoming increasingly available and will continue to do so in the coming years thanks to the launch of space missions which aim at providing a coverage of the earth every few days with high spatial resolution. in the case of optical imagery, it will be possible to produce land use and cover change maps with detailed nomenclatures. however, due to meteorological phenomena, such as clouds, these time series will become irregular in terms of temporal sampling, and one will need to compare time series with different lengths. in this paper, we present an approach to image time series analysis which is able to deal with irregularly sampled series and which also allows the comparison of pairs of time series where each element of the pair has a different number of samples. we present the dynamic time warping from a theoretical point of view and illustrate its capabilities with two applications to real-time series.
the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus which first appeared in southern china at the end of 2002. in early 2003, through a single incident, it spread to hong kong, singapore, canada and vietnam. for busy clinicians in large public hospitals, the response to the virus was initially based on ensuring a high level of protection for staff. however, as the epidemic progressed and more information became available about the virus, procedures were rationalized and the virus is currently under control worldwide. there are, however, numerous unanswered questions concerning super-spreading events, the modes of transmission of the virus and, perhaps most importantly, the rapid detection of the virus early in the course of disease. these issues need to be addressed in case the virus becomes more widespread in the near future.  background severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) is continuing to spread around the world. all hospitals must be prepared to care for patients with sars. thus, it is important to understand the transmission of this disease in hospitals and to evaluate methods for its containment in health care institutions. we describe how we cared for the first 2 patients with sars admitted to our 419-bed community hospital in richmond hill, ont., and the response to a sars outbreak within our institution.   methods we collected clinical and epidemiological data about patients and health care workers at our institution who during a 13-day period had a potential unprotected exposure to 2 patients whose signs and symptoms were subsequently identified as meeting the case definition for probable sars. the index case at our hospital was a patient who was transferred to our intensive care unit (icu) from a referral hospital on mar. 16, 2003, where he had been in close proximity to the son of the individual with the first reported case of sars in toronto. after 13 days in the icu, a diagnosis of probable sars was reached for our index case. immediately upon diagnosis of our index case, respiratory isolation and barrier precautions were instituted throughout our hospital and maintained for a period of 10 days, which is the estimated maximum incubation period reported for this disease. aggressive surveillance measures among hospital staff, patients and visitors were also maintained during this time.   results during the surveillance period, 15 individuals (10 hospital staff, 3 patients and 2 visitors) were identified as meeting the case definition for probable or suspected sars, in addition to our index case. all but 1 individual had had direct contact with a symptomatic patient with sars during the period of unprotected exposure. no additional cases were identified after infection control precautions had been implemented for 8 days. no cases of secondary transmission were identified in the 21 days following the implementation of these precautions at our institution.   interpretation sars can easily be spread by direct personal contact in the hospital setting. we found that the implementation of aggressive infection control measures is effective in preventing further transmission of this disease.
many structured prediction tasks in machine vision have a collection of acceptable answers, instead of one definitive ground truth answer. segmentation of images, for example, is subject to human labeling bias. similarly, there are multiple possible pixel values that could plausibly complete occluded image regions. state-of-the art supervised learning methods are typically optimized to make a single test-time prediction for each query, failing to find other modes in the output space. existing methods that allow for sampling often sacrifice speed or accuracy. we introduce a simple method for training a neural network, which enables diverse structured predictions to be made for each test-time query. for a single input, we learn to predict a range of possible answers. we compare favorably to methods that seek diversity through an ensemble of networks. such stochastic multiple choice learning faces mode collapse, where one or more ensemble members fail to receive any training signal. our best performing solution can be deployed for various tasks, and just involves small modifications to the existing single-mode architecture, loss function, and training regime. we demonstrate that our method results in quantitative improvements across three challenging tasks: 2d image completion, 3d volume estimation, and flow prediction.  many practical perception systems exist within larger processes that include interactions with users or additional components capable of evaluating the quality of predicted solutions. in these contexts, it is beneficial to provide these oracle mechanisms with multiple highly likely hypotheses rather than a single prediction. in this work, we pose the task of producing multiple outputs as a learning problem over an ensemble of deep networks -- introducing a novel stochastic gradient descent based approach to minimize the loss with respect to an oracle. our method is simple to implement, agnostic to both architecture and loss function, and parameter-free. our approach achieves lower oracle error compared to existing methods on a wide range of tasks and deep architectures. we also show qualitatively that the diverse solutions produced often provide interpretable representations of task ambiguity.
cells can release the free amino acid taurine through volume-regulated anion channels (vracs), and it has been hypothesized that taurine released from glial cells is capable of inhibiting action potential (ap) firing by activating neuronal glycine receptors (glyrs) (hussy et al., 1997). although an inhibitory glyr tone is widely observed in the brain, it remains unknown whether this specifically reflects gliotransmission because most neurons also express vracs and other endogenous molecules can activate glyrs. we found that vracs are absent in neurons of the rat supraoptic nucleus (son), suggesting that glial cells are the exclusive source of taurine in this nucleus. application of strychnine to rat hypothalamic explants caused a depolarization of son neurons associated with a decrease of chloride conductance and could excite these cells in the absence of fast synaptic transmission. this inhibitory glyr tone was eliminated by pharmacological blockade of vracs, by cellular taurine depletion, by metabolic inactivation of glia with fluorocitrate, and after retraction of astrocytic processes that intercalate neuronal somata and dendrites. finally, glyr tone varied inversely with extracellular fluid tonicity to mediate the osmotic control of ap firing by son neurons. these findings establish taurine as a physiological gliotransmitter and show that gliotransmission is a spatially constrained process that can be modulated by the morphological rearrangement of astrocytes.  whole cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from isolated rat supraoptic nucleus magnocellular neurosecretory cells (mncs). under current clamping, hyperosmolality produced by the addition of 10-30 mm mannitol depolarized each of 25 cells tested. in contrast, reducing fluid osmolality from 295 to 265 mosmol/kgh2o had the reverse effect, hyperpolarizing 18 of 21 mncs. voltage-clamp recordings in 43 cells revealed that the effects of hypo- and hyperosmolality, respectively, were caused by decreases and increases in a nonselective cation conductance reversing near -41 mv. current-voltage analysis in na(+)-free solution revealed that the reversal potentials of currents elicited by increases and decreases in osmolality both shifted to a value near -90 mv, suggesting that a single ionic conductance is modulated by these stimuli. the relation between cationic conductance and osmolality was specific, sensitive (+2.14%.mosmol-1.kgh2o-1), and well-fit by linear regression (r = 0.96; n = 22 cells) between 275 and 325 mosmol/kgh2o. these results indicate that mncs express a depolarizing current that is active under steady-state conditions and that the up- or downregulation of this current contributes to the excitation or inhibition of these cells upon acute exposure to hypo- or hyperosmolar conditions.
cadmium (cd2+) induces renal proximal tubular (pt) damage, including disruption of the e-cadherin/β-catenin complex of adherens junctions (ajs) and apoptosis. yet, chronic cd2+ exposure causes malignant transformation of renal cells. previously, we have demonstrated that cd2+-mediated up-regulation of the multidrug transporter abcb1 causes apoptosis resistance in pt cells. we hypothesized that cd2+ activates adaptive signaling mechanisms mediated by β-catenin to evade apoptosis and increase proliferation. here we show that 50 µm cd2+, which induces cell death via apoptosis and necrosis, also causes a decrease of the trans-epithelial resistance of confluent wkpt-0293 cl.2 cells, a rat renal pt cell model, within 45 min of cd2+ exposure, as measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates cd2+-induced decrease of e-cadherin at ajs and redistribution of β-catenin from the e-cadherin/β-catenin complex of ajs to cytosol and nuclei after 3 h. immunoblotting confirms cd2+-induced decrease of e-cadherin expression and translocation of β-catenin to cytosol and nuclei of pt cells. rt-pcr shows cd2+-induced increase of expression of c-myc and of the isoform abcb1a at 3 h. the data prove for the first time that cd2+ induces nuclear translocation of β-catenin in pt cells. we speculate that cd2+ activates β-catenin/t-cell factor signaling to trans-activate proliferation and apoptosis resistance genes and promote carcinogenesis of pt cells.  cadherins and other cell–substrate and cell–cell adhesion molecules play an essential role during development. through their cytoplasmic interaction with the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion molecules physically link cells with the extracellular matrix and/or with each other. these interactions create architectural and structural entities that enable the tissues in the embryo to restrain the physical forces encountered during development. regulated cell adhesion is also often the driving force of morphogenetic movements. this review goes beyond the adhesive aspect of cadherins, focusing on their roles as signaling molecules in development. we discuss how cadherins, through their effects on cell proliferation, cell death, cell polarization, and differentiation, play a role in the formation of tissues and organs in the developing embryo. bioessays 21:211–220, 1999. © 1999 john wiley & sons, inc.
isovaleric acidemia (iva, mim 248600) can be a severe and potentially life-threatening disease in affected neonates, but with a positive prognosis on treatment for some phenotypes. this study presents the first application of metabolomics to evaluate the metabolite profiles derived from urine samples of untreated and treated iva patients as well as of obligate heterozygotes. all iva patients carried the same homozygous c.367 g > a nucleotide change in exon 4 of the ivd gene but manifested phenotypic diversity. concurrent class analysis (conca) was used to compare all the metabolites from the original complete data set obtained from the three case and two control groups used in this investigation. this application of conca has not been reported previously, and is used here to compare four different modes of scaling of all metabolites. the variables important in discrimination from the conca thus enabled the recognition of different metabolic patterns encapsulated within the data sets that would not have been revealed by using only one mode of scaling. application of multivariate and univariate analyses disclosed 11 important metabolites that distinguished untreated iva from controls. these included well-established diagnostic biomarkers of iva, endogenous detoxification markers, and 3-hydroxycaproic acid, an indicator of ketosis, but not reported previously for this disease. nine metabolites were identified that reflected the effect of treatment of iva. they included detoxification products and indicators related to the high carbohydrate and low protein diet which formed the hallmark of the treatment. this investigation also provides the first comparative metabolite profile for heterozygotes of this inherited metabolic disorder. the detection of informative metabolites in even very low concentrations in all three experimental groups highlights the potential advantage of the holistic mode of analysis of inherited metabolic diseases in a metabolomics investigation.  isovaleric acidemia (iva) is one of the most common organic acidemias found in south africa. since 1983, a significant number of iva cases have been identified in approximately 20,000 caucasian patients screened for metabolic defects. iva is caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of isovaleryl-coa dehydrogenase (ivd) resulting in the accumulation of isovaleryl-coa and its metabolites. in total, 10 iva patients and three carriers were available for phenotypic and genotypic investigation in this study. all patients were found to be homozygous for a single c.367 g > a (p.g123r) mutation. the amino acid substitution of a glycine to arginine resulted in a markedly reduced steady-state level of the ivd protein, which explains the nearly complete lack of ivd enzyme activity as assessed in fibroblast homogenates. despite the genetic homogeneity of this south african iva group, the clinical presentation varied widely, ranging from severe mental handicap and multiple episodes of metabolic derangement to an asymptomatic state. the variation may be due to poor dietary intervention, delayed diagnosis or even epigenetic and polygenetic factors of unknown origin.
summarydifferential osteogenic potential and responsiveness to 17β-estradiol (e2) of mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) were found between postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (op) and osteoarthritis (oa). these results suggest differential biological mechanisms of estrogen deficiency in regulation of bone remodeling between op and oa.introductionop and oa are two common disorders in postmenopausal women. the inverse relationship has been suggested between op and oa, but their mechanisms that relate to estrogen deficiency are not fully understood. the aim of this study was to compare the differential responsiveness to e2 of mscs from osteoporotic versus osteoarthritic donors.methodstwenty postmenopausal patients, ten with osteoporotic hip fractures and ten with hip osteoarthritis, were included into this study. mscs were derived from cancellous bones of femoral heads from oa and op donors and cultured in osteogenic and adipogenic medium with or without e2 added. the alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity, calcium content, calcified nodules, lipid droplets, messenger rna (mrna) expression of alp, osteocalcin (oc), collagen 1α (col1α), peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ2 (pparγ2) and lipoprotein lipase (lpl) were measured and compared between two groups with op and oa.resultsin osteogenic medium, alp activity, calcium content and mrna expression of oc and col1α in mscs from oa were significantly higher than those from op group. in adipogenic condition, there was no significant difference in lipid droplets formation and mrna expression of pparγ2 and lpl between op and oa groups. with e2 added in osteogenic medium, alp activity, calcium content and oc mrna were significantly higher in op group than in oa group, whereas e2 had no significant effect on lipid droplet formation and mrna expression of pparγ2 and lpl.conclusiondifferential osteogenic potential and responsiveness to e2 of mscs were found between postmenopausal women with op and oa. these results may provide information for clinical application of mscs in the differential setting of estrogen deficiency.  the aim of this study was to compare the osteogenic potential and responsiveness to leptin of mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) from bone marrow between postmenopausal women with osteoarthritis (oa) and osteoporosis (op). mscs of the proximal femur from oa and op donors were cultured under control and different experimental mediums. after verifying the availability of primary cells, their osteogenic potential and responsiveness to leptin were compared between two groups. similar patterns of cell growth were shown in both oa and op groups. however, after the sixth passage, the viability of undifferentiated cells decreased more in op than in oa donors. under the same osteogenic supplements condition, the mrna expression of osteogenesis‐specific genes, osteocalcin (oc) and alkaline phosphatase (alp) were higher in oa group. comparison of bone matrix mineralization was parallel to that of mrna expression. the level of bone‐specific alp (bap) was higher in cells from donors with oa, whereas osteoprotegerin (opg) was higher in op group. this difference in bap expression proved to be insignificant after the administration of leptin. although leptin upregulated the expression of opg, a significant difference still existed between oa and op. in conclusion, differential osteogenic potential and responsiveness to leptin of mscs were noted between postmenopausal women with oa and op. differential biological behavior of mscs seems to be partly related to the different distribution of bone mass between oa and op populations. © 2009 orthopaedic research society. published by wiley periodicals, inc. j orthop res 27: 1067–1073, 2009
after the failure of conservative treatment of neurogenic bladders, urinary diversion has to be considered. for patients with chronic renal failure, severe dilated upper urinary tracts with deterioration of the renal function and those who are not able to perform a self-catheterization, the colonic conduit diversion is our therapy of choice. in this part of the study, we investigate the long-term safety of our concept for these patients in regard to protecting the upper urinary tracts. between 1968 and 2002, colonic conduit urinary diversion was performed in 88 patients, in most of them in the era before continent diversion. overall, 11 patients with a colonic conduit were converted to bladder substitution or continent cutaneous diversion during the follow-up period. these patients are no longer included in the long-term follow-up of colonic conduit patients. of the 77 patients with colonic conduit diversion, 21 patients were not available for follow-up: 11 were deceased and 10 were lost to follow-up. three of the deaths were related to nephrological complications in patients who already had impaired renal function before conduit diversion. an average follow-up of 21.8 years (2–32.7; median 23.8 years.) is available in 56 patients with 99 rus (6 solitary kidneys, 7 nephrectomies). five non-functioning kidneys were removed after recurrent pyelonephritis and two kidneys with pyonephrosis. ureter stenoses were corrected in 6% of the rus. as compared to preoperatively, the upper urinary tracts remained stable or improved in 97/99 rus at the latest follow-up. a revision of the stoma was necessary in 16% (conduit elongation n =2, stenosis n =7) and calculi formations were treated in 8% of the rus. for patients with chronic renal failure or who are unable to perform a catheterization of a continent stoma, the colonic conduit is a safe alternative in the long run.  a study of the long-term results of ileal conduit urinary diversion for non-malignant disease in 90 children has shown that there were 75 survivors after 10 to 16 years. stomal stenosis and ureteroileal or other intrinsic obstructions requiring ileal loop revisions occurred frequently and as late as 13 years postoperatively. of 144 renal units 76 per cent improved or remained stable and 69.3 per cent of normal kidneys remained normal after more than a decade of urinary diversion. in order to obtain these results close lifetime followup and aggressive loop revisions have been required. urine cultures were consistently negative in 70.5 per cent of all patients. good results were obtained in terms of preservation of renal function in all categories. creatinine clearance remained in the normal range after 10 years if the excretory urogram remained normal. ileal conduit urinary diversion remains a major surgical undertaking but it also remains the standard of urinary diversion against which all other methods must be judged. the results in terms of renal preservation are impressive but so too are the significant number of long-term complications. any other method of diversion (such as the sigmoid conduit) that can improve upon these results will be welcomed. all children with ileal conduit urinary diversion for reasons other than a neurogenic bladder must be considered candidates for urinary reconstruction.
backgroundalthough laparoscopic major hepatectomy (lmh) is becoming increasingly common in specialized centers, data regarding laparoscopic extended major hepatectomies (lemh) and their outcomes are limited. the aim of this study was to compare the perioperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes of lemh to standard lmh.methodsall patients who underwent purely laparoscopic anatomical right or left hepatectomy and right or left trisectionectomy between february 1998 and january 2016 are enrolled. demographic, clinicopathological, and perioperative factors were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. perioperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes in lemh were compared to those of standard lmh.resultsamong 195 patients with lmh, 47 (24.1%) underwent lemh, colorectal liver metastases representing 66.7% of all indications. preoperative portal vein embolization was undertaken in 31 (15.9%) patients. despite more frequent vascular clamping, blood loss was higher in lemh group (400 vs. 214 ml; p = 0.006). however, there was no difference in intraoperative transfusion requirements. thirty-one patients experienced liver failure with no differences between lmh and lemh groups. postoperative mortality was comparable in the two groups [3 (2.5%) lmh patients vs. 2 (5%) lemh patients (p = 0.388)]. overall morbidity was higher in the lemh group [49 lmh patients (41.5%) vs. 24 lemh patients (60%) (p = 0.052)]. patients treated with left lemh experienced more biliary leakage (p = 0.011) and more major pulmonary complications (p = 0.015) than left lmh.conclusionlemh is feasible at the price of important morbidity, with manageable and acceptable outcomes. these exigent procedures require high-volume centers with experienced surgeons.  background left hepatic trisectionectomy is the most extended hepatic resection. to date, few data are available on longterm outcomes after this operation.   study design between june 1998 and july 2004, a total of 52 patients underwent left trisectionectomy for primary or secondary hepatobiliary tumors at our institution. data were analyzed with regard to patient characteristics, intraoperative details, pathologic findings, perioperative morbidity and mortality, and outcomes as determined by survival.   results left trisectionectomy was combined with caudate lobectomy and hilar lymph node dissection in 29 and 35 patients, respectively. in addition, 43 procedures were performed in 31 patients: resection of hilar bifurcation (n = 15), bile-duct revision (n = 5), wedge resection of segment vi/vii (n = 10), gastrectomy (n = 1), and resection or reconstruction of hepatic vessels or the inferior vena cava (n = 12). operative morbidity and mortality were 50% and 11.9%, respectively. by multivariate analysis, additional operative procedures constituted the only positive predictor of postoperative morbidity. one-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 65%, 52%, and 33%, respectively. after r0 resection (n = 37), 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 78%, 68%, and 44% compared with 38%, 15%, and 7% after r1 resection (p = 0.0004). survival corresponding to the four most frequent tumor types (hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocellular carcinoma, hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and colorectal metastases) was comparable with survival data reported in the literature after less-extensive resections.   conclusions left trisectionectomy provides acceptable survival rates in both locally advanced primary hepatobiliary malignancies and large metastatic liver tumors. despite major progress in surgical technique and perioperative management, left trisectionectomy is still associated with higher operative mortality and morbidity than less-extensive resections. because selection criteria for this type of procedure are not clearly defined, particular attention should be focused on the oncologic benefits when considering this operation.
a new (3) and three known germacrane-type sesquiterpenoids were isolated from the chloroform-soluble fraction of the methanolic extract of the bark of magnolia kobus (magnoliaceae) through repeated silica gel and sephadex lh-20 column chromatography. their chemical structures were elucidated as costunolide (1), parthenolide (2), isobisparthenolidine (3), and bisparthenolidine (4) by spectroscopic analysis. compounds 1–4 exhibited cytotoxicity against human a549, sk-ov-3, sk-mel-2, and hct15 tumor cells.  ten compounds were isolated from the etoac soluble part of the meoh extract of saussureae radix, with their effects on melanin production also evaluated in b-16 mouse melanoma cell lines stimulated with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (ibmx), an elevator of cellular camp. the compounds were identified as aplotaxene (1), 1β-hydroxy arbusculin a (2), costunolide (3), dehydrocostuslactone (4), 11β,13-dihydrocostunolide (5), reynosin (6), heptadec-(9z)-enoic acid (7), β-sitosterol (8), linoleic acid methyl ester (9) and betulinic acid methyl ester (10). compounds 2, 9 and 10 were identified from saussureae radix for the first time. furthermore, compounds 2, 3 and 6 showed potent inhibitory effects on the ibmx-induced melanogenesis, in dose-dependent manners, with ic50 values of 11, 3 and 2.5 μg/ml, respectively. as a positive control, arbutin exhibited an ic50 value of 29 μg/ml.
escherichia coli o157∶h7 is a mesophilic food-borne pathogen. we investigated the growth kinetics of e. coli o157∶h7 sakai during an abrupt temperature downshift from 35°c to either 20°c, 17°c, 14°c or 10°c; as well as the molecular mechanisms enabling growth after cold stress upon an abrupt downshift from 35°c to 14°c in an integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. all downshifts caused a lag period of growth before growth resumed at a rate typical of the post-shift temperature. lag and generation time increased with the magnitude of the shift or with the final temperature, while relative lag time displayed little variation across the test range. analysis of time-dependent molecular changes revealed, in keeping with a decreased growth rate at lower temperature, repression of genes and proteins involved in dna replication, protein synthesis and carbohydrate catabolism. consistent with cold-induced remodelling of the bacterial cell envelope, alterations occurred in the expression of genes and proteins involved in transport and binding. the rpos regulon exhibited sustained induction confirming its importance in adaptation and growth at 14°c. the rpoe regulon was transiently induced, indicating a potential role for this extracytoplasmic stress response system in the early phase of low temperature adaptation during lag phase. interestingly, genes previously reported to be amongst the most highly up-regulated under oxidative stress were consistently down-regulated. this comprehensive analysis provides insight into the molecular mechanisms operating during adaptation of e. coli to growth at low temperature and is relevant to its physiological state during chilling in foods, such as carcasses.  an integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analysis was undertaken to determine the physiological response of escherichia coli o157:h7 sakai to steady-state conditions relevant to low temperature and water activity conditions experienced during meat carcass chilling in cold air. the response of e. coli during exponential growth at 25 °c aw 0.985, 14 °c aw 0.985, 25 °c aw 0.967, and 14 °c aw 0.967 was compared with that of a reference culture (35 °c aw 0.993). gene and protein expression profiles of e. coli were more strongly affected by low water activity (aw 0.967) than by low temperature (14 °c). predefined group enrichment analysis revealed that a universal response of e. coli to all test conditions included activation of the master stress response regulator rpos and the rcs phosphorelay system involved in the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide colanic acid, as well as down-regulation of elements involved in chemotaxis and motility. however, colanic acid-deficient mutants were shown to achieve comparable growth rates to their wild-type parents under all conditions, indicating that colanic acid is not required for growth. in contrast to the transcriptomic data, the proteomic data revealed that several processes involved in protein synthesis were down-regulated in overall expression at 14 °c aw 0.985, 25 °c aw 0.967, and 14 °c aw 0.967. this result suggests that during growth under these conditions, e. coli, although able to transcribe the required mrna, may lack the cellular resources required for translation. elucidating the global adaptive response of e. coli o157:h7 during exposure to chilling and water activity stress has provided a baseline of knowledge of the physiology of this pathogen.
during the course of the disease a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) may develop inflammation of one or more serous membranes, resulting in pleural, peritoneal, or pericardial effusion. chylous ascites and chylothorax have rarely been described in patients with sle. therefore, in parallel with the analysis of blood samples, detailed analysis of the effusions should be carried out. supportive measures are often needed to relieve the symptoms of chylothorax or chylous ascites together with the treatment of the primary disease. the available literature had reported just 4 cases of chylous ascites and/or chylothorax in association with sle, and this patient presented here is one of the rare cases apart from the reported ones.  we describe a patient with a history of discoid lupus erythematosus who presented with chylous ascites and chylothorax. analysis of peritoneal and pleural fluid showed a high level of triglycerides and the presence of antinuclear antibody and anti-dsdna antibody. further study revealed other diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus and serologic markers of disease activity. the patient was successfully treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy and high doses of prednisone, followed by immunosuppressants.
backgroundfew studies to date have explored the stated preferences of national decision makers for health technology adoption criteria, and none of these have compared stated decision-making behaviours against actual behaviours. assessment of the external validity of stated preference studies, such as discrete-choice experiments (dces), remains an under-researched area.objectivesthe primary aim was to explore the preferences of all wales medicines strategy group (awmsg) appraisal committee and appraisal sub-committee (the new medicines group) members (‘appraisal committees’) for specific new medicines adoption criteria. secondary aims were to explore the external validity of respondents’ stated preferences and the impact of question choice options upon preference structures in dces.methodsa dce was conducted to estimate appraisal committees members’ preferences for incremental cost effectiveness, quality-adjusted life-years (qalys) gained, annual number of patients expected to be treated, the impact of the disease on patients before treatment, and the assessment of uncertainty in the economic evidence submitted for new medicines compared with current uk nhs treatment. respondents evaluated 28 pairs of hypothetical new medicines, making a primary forced choice between each pair and a more flexible secondary choice, which permitted either, neither or both new medicines to be chosen. the performance of the resultant models was compared against previous awmsg decisions.resultsforty-one out of a total of 80 past and present members of awmsg appraisal committees completed the dce. the incremental cost effectiveness of new medicines, and the qaly gains they provide, significantly (p < 0.0001) influence recommendations. committee members were willing to accept higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and lower qaly gains for medicines that treat disease impacting primarily upon survival rather than quality of life, and where uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness estimates has been thoroughly explored. the number of patients to be treated by the new medicine did not exert a significant influence upon recommendations. the use of a flexible-choice question format revealed a different preference structure to the forced-choice format, but the performance of the two models was similar. aggregate decisions of the awmsg were well predicted by both models, but their sensitivity (64 %, 68 %) and specificity (55 %, 64 %) were limited.conclusionsa willingness to trade the cost effectiveness and qaly gains against other factors indicates that economic efficiency and qaly maximisation are not the only considerations of committee members when making recommendations on the use of medicines in wales. on average, appraisal committee members’ stated preferences appear consistent with their actual decision-making behaviours, providing support for the external validity of our dces. however, as health technology assessment involves complex decision-making processes, and each individual recommendation may be influenced to varying degrees by a multitude of different considerations, the ability of our models to predict individual medicine recommendations is more limited.  the decisions made by the national institute for clinical excellence (nice) give rise to two questions: how is cost-effectiveness evidence used to make judgements about the 'value for money' of health technologies? and how are factors other than cost-effectiveness taken into account? the aim of this paper is to explore nice's cost-effectiveness threshold(s) and the tradeoffs between cost effectiveness and other factors apparent in its decisions. binary choice analysis is used to reveal the preferences of nice and to consider the consistency of its decisions. for each decision to accept or reject a technology, explanatory variables include: the cost per life year or per qaly gained; uncertainty regarding cost effectiveness; the net cost to the nhs; the burden of disease; the availability (or not) of alternative treatments; and specific factors indicated by nice. results support the broad notion of a threshold, where the probability of rejection increases as the cost per qaly increases. cost effectiveness, together with uncertainty and the burden of disease, explain nice decisions better than cost effectiveness alone. the results suggest a threshold somewhat higher than nices stated 'range of acceptable cost effectiveness' of pound 20,000-30,000 british pounds per qaly--although the exact meaning of a 'range' in this context remains unclear.
objective to examine the long-term effects of a personality-targeted intervention on drinking quantity and frequency (qf), problem drinking, and personality-specific motivations for alcohol use in early adolescence.   method a randomized control trial was carried out with 364 adolescents (median age 14) recruited from 13 secondary schools with elevated scores in hopelessness, anxiety-sensitivity (as), impulsivity, and sensation-seeking. participants were randomly assigned to a control no-intervention condition or a 2-session group coping skills intervention targeting 1 of 4 personality risk factors. the effects of the intervention on quantity/frequency (qf) of alcohol use, frequency of binge drinking, problem drinking, and motives were examined at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postintervention.   results intent-to-treat repeated measures analyses revealed a significant overall intervention effect in reducing problem drinking symptoms, and a time × intervention effect on drinking qf and binge drinking frequency. relative to the control group, the intervention group showed significantly reduced drinking and binge drinking levels at 6 months postintervention and reduced problem drinking symptoms for the full 24-month follow-up period (cohen's d = 0.33). a significant time × intervention × personality interaction was demonstrated for coping and enhancement drinking motives. in addition to an overall effect of intervention on coping motives, the as group who received that intervention reported fewer coping motives compared with the as control group at 12 and 24 months postintervention.   conclusions this study provides further evidence showing that personality-targeted interventions reduce drinking behavior in adolescents in the short term. novel findings were that the interventions were shown to produced long-term effects on drinking problems and personality-specific effects on drinking motives.  context selective interventions targeting personality risk are showing promise in the prevention of problematic drinking behavior, but their effect on illicit drug use has yet to be evaluated.   objective to investigate the efficacy of targeted coping skills interventions on illicit drug use in adolescents with personality risk factors for substance misuse.   design randomized controlled trial.   setting secondary schools in london, united kingdom.   participants a total of 5302 students were screened to identify 2028 students aged 13 to 16 years with elevated scores on self-report measures of hopelessness, anxiety sensitivity, impulsivity, and sensation seeking. seven hundred thirty-two students provided parental consent to participate in this trial.   intervention participants were randomly assigned to a control no-intervention condition or a 2-session group coping skills intervention targeting 1 of 4 personality profiles.   main outcome measures the trial was designed and powered to primarily evaluate the effect of the intervention on the onset, prevalence, and frequency of illicit drug use over a 2-year period.   results intent-to-treat repeated-measures analyses on continuous measures of drug use revealed time x intervention effects on the number of drugs used (p < .01) and drug use frequency (p < .05), whereby the control group showed significant growth in the number of drugs used as well as more frequent drug use over the 2-year period relative to the intervention group. survival analysis using logistic regression revealed that the intervention was associated with reduced odds of taking up the use of marijuana (beta = -0.3; robust se = 0.2; p = .09; odds ratio = 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.0), cocaine (beta = -1.4; robust se = 0.4; p < .001; odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.5), and other drugs (beta = -0.7; robust se = 0.3; p = .03; odds ratio = 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.9) over the 24-month period.   conclusion this study extends the evidence that brief, personality-targeted interventions can prevent the onset and escalation of substance misuse in high-risk adolescents.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct00344474.
background there is an unmet need for practical and reliable biomarkers for mood disorders in young adults. identifying the brain activity associated with the early signs of depressive disorders could have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. in this study we sought to investigate the eeg characteristics in young adults with newly identified depressive symptoms.   methods based on the initial screening, a total of 100 participants (n = 50 euthymic, n = 50 depressive) underwent 32-channel eeg acquisition. simple logistic regression and c-statistic were used to explore if eeg power could be used to discriminate between the groups. the strongest eeg predictors of mood using multivariate logistic regression models.   results simple logistic regression analysis with subsequent c-statistics revealed that only high-alpha and beta power originating from the left central cortex (c3) have a reliable discriminative value (roc curve >0.7 (70%)) for differentiating the depressive group from the euthymic group. multivariate regression analysis showed that the single most significant predictor of group (depressive vs. euthymic) is the high-alpha power over c3 (p = 0.03).   conclusion the present findings suggest that eeg is a useful tool in the identification of neurophysiological correlates of depressive symptoms in young adults with no previous psychiatric history.   significance our results could guide future studies investigating the early neurophysiological changes and surrogate outcomes in depression.  in previous quantitative eeg studies of depression, mostly patients with a lifetime history of depressive disorders were reported. this study examined quantitative eeg parameters obtained in the early stages of depression in comparison with age-matched healthy controls. eeg was recorded using two different montages in eyes closed and eyes open resting states. a significant increase in spectrum power in theta (4–7.5 hz), alpha (7.5–14 hz), and beta (14–20 hz) frequency bands was found in depressed patients at parietal and occipital sites, both in eyes closed and eyes open conditions. these results suggest that an increase in slow (theta and alpha) activity in the eeg pattern may reflect a decreased cortical activation in these brain regions. enhancement of beta power may correlate with anxiety symptoms that most likely play an important role on the onset of depressive disorder.
the role of nitric oxide (no) mechanisms incontrol of pyloric function and transpyloric flow wereinvestigated in six conscious dogs. antropyloroduodenalmotility, transpyloric flow, and gastric emptying were measured 15 min after intravenousinjection of 100 ml of either saline, l-arginine (50mg/kg), l-nna (5 mg/kg), or l-arginine (50 mg/kg)followed by l-nna (5 mg/kg). infusion of l-nna wasassociated with retardation of gastric emptying (65± 6%) in the first 30 min, in comparison to thesaline (90 ± 3%) or l-arginine (90 ± 2%).this effect was prevented by infusion of l-arginineprior to l-nna, after which 89 ± 3% of the liquidemptied in 30 min. there was a significant reduction (p< 0.05) in the number and volume of flow pulses, andan increase in pyloric tone (p < 0.05) after l-nna in comparison to the other three testconditions. there were no differences, however, in thenumber of antropyloric or isolated pyloric pressurewaves under the four conditions. our findings suggestthat no mechanisms influence gastric emptying andtranspyloric flow of nonnutrient liquids by altering thepyloric tone, thus increasing resistance toflow.  antropyloroduodenal motility was recorded in seven anesthetized dogs to assess the role of nitric oxide and l-arginine metabolites in nonadrenergic noncholinergic (nanc) mediation of pyloric relaxation. pyloric activity induced by duodenal field stimulation was inhibited by antral field stimulation and electrical vagal stimulation. intra-arterial ng-l-arginine-methyl-ester (l-name) reduced the inhibition from antral or vagal stimulation (p less than 0.05). intravenous infusion of l-name also blocked the inhibitory effect of vagal and antral stimulation but left the tetrodotoxin-insensitive action of intra-arterial vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip) and sodium nitroprusside unchanged. l-arginine reversed the effect of l-name whereas d-arginine did not. l-name enhanced pyloric contractions to intra-arterial acetylcholine. the nanc inhibition of the substance p-stimulated pyloric response in vitro was blocked by l-name and reversed by addition of l-arginine. sodium nitroprusside was effective as a relaxant in vitro but vip was not. these data suggest that metabolites of l-arginine mediate neural inhibition of canine pyloric motor activity.
recently an advanced class of encryption systems, functional encryption (fe), formalized by boneh, sahai and waters [tcc’11] and o’neill [iacr eprint’10], have been extensively studied, where a ciphertext of plaintext x is decrypted to f(x) by a secret key associated with a function f , and there is a layered structure for keys such that a higher level key is a pair of master public and secret keys (for an authority) and a lower level key is a secret key with f (for a user) and is generated by a master secret key. in my talk, we show two fe schemes for all (polynomial-size) circuits on the decisional linear (dlin) assumption. our fe schemes are adaptively secure and attribute-hiding in the indistinguishability-based security definition (not in the simulation-based security definition). in the first fe scheme, the number of secret keys is (polynomially) bounded, while that of ciphertexts is unbounded, and the security is proven solely under the dlin assumption. the second fe scheme requires no bound on the number of secret keys and ciphertexts, but assumes the existence of the indistinguishability obfuscation, which was introduced by barak et al. [crypto’01] and recently instantiated by garg et al. [focs’13] from the multi-linear maps, in addition to the dlin assumption. these fe schemes are constructed on the randomized encoding technique by applebaum et al. [computational complexity’06] and (strongly) attribute-hiding inner-product encryption (ipe), which is instantiated by the okamoto-takashima ipe scheme [eurocrypt’12] under the dlin assumption. * this is a joint work with koutarou suzuki. linear cryptanalysis and its extensions  scan chains are exploited to develop attacks on cryptographic hardware and steal intellectual properties from the chip. this paper proposes a secured strategy to test designs by inserting a certain number of inverters between randomly selected scan cells. the security of the scheme has been analyzed. two detailed case studies of rc4 stream cipher and aes block cipher have been presented to show that the proposed strategy prevents existing scan-based attacks in the literature. the elegance of the scheme lies in its less hardware overhead.
several factors modulate the first step of odour detection in the rat olfactory mucosa (om). among others, vasoactive peptides such as endothelin might play multifaceted roles in the different om cells. like their counterparts in the central nervous system, the olfactory sensory neurons are encompassed by different glial‐like non‐neuronal om cells; sustentacular cells (scs) surround their cell bodies, whereas olfactory ensheathing cells (oecs) wrap their axons. whereas scs maintain both the structural and ionic integrity of the om, oecs assure protection, local blood flow control and guiding of olfactory sensory neuron axons toward the olfactory bulb. we previously showed that these non‐neuronal om cells are particularly responsive to endothelin in vitro. here, we confirmed that the endothelin system is strongly expressed in the om using in situ hybridization. we then further explored the effects of endothelin on scs and oecs using electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging approaches on both in vitro and ex vivo om preparations. endothelin induced both robust calcium signals and gap junction uncoupling in both types of cells. this latter effect was mimicked by carbenoxolone, a known gap junction uncoupling agent. however, although endothelin is known for its antiapoptotic effect in the om, the uncoupling of gap junctions by carbenoxolone was not sufficient to limit the cellular death induced by serum deprivation in om primary culture. the functional consequence of the endothelin 1‐induced reduction of the gap junctional communication between om non‐neuronal cells thus remains to be elucidated.  although gap junctions regulate essential processes during development and differentiation, the role of gap junctions in cell death is poorly understood. we demonstrate here that the forced expression of connexin 43 (cx43), the main constituent of astrocytic gap junctions, protected against cell injury with a potency that was comparable with that from the expression of the proto-oncogenebcl2. the expression of two other members of the cx family, cx32 and cx40, also increased the resistance to injury from exposures to calcium overload, oxidative stress, metabolic inhibition, tamoxifen, and uv irradiation, but not against staurosporine- and dexamethasone-mediated death. surprisingly, the anti-death activity of connexin proteins was independent of gap junction channel function, because physical isolation or the pharmacological inhibition of coupling did not significantly increase cell death. moreover, cells expressing nonfunctional mutant connexins also acquired a high resistance to injury. these observations identify cx proteins as active players in cell survival.
recently, the worldwide propagation of clonal ctx-m-15-producing escherichia coli isolates, namely st131 and o25b:h4, has been reported. like the majority of extra-intestinal pathogenic e. coli isolates, the pandemic clone st131 belongs to phylogenetic group b2, and has recently been shown to be highly virulent in a mouse model, even though it lacks several genes encoding key virulence factors (pap, cnf1 and hlya). using two animal models, caenorhabditis elegans and zebrafish embryos, we assessed the virulence of three e. coli st131 strains (2 ctx-m-15- producing urine and 1 non-esbl-producing faecal isolate), comparing them with five non-st131 b2 and a group a uropathogenic e. coli (upec). in c. elegans, the three st131 strains showed intermediate virulence between the non virulent group a isolate and the virulent non-st131 b2 strains. in zebrafish, the ctx-m-15-producing st131 upec isolates were also less virulent than the non-st131 b2 strains, suggesting that the production of ctx-m-15 is not correlated with enhanced virulence. amongst the non-st131 b2 group isolates, variation in pathogenic potential in zebrafish embryos was observed ranging from intermediate to highly virulent. interestingly, the st131 strains were equally persistent in surviving embryos as the non-st131-group b2 strains, suggesting similar mechanisms may account for development of persistent infection. optical maps of the genome of the st131 strains were compared with those of 24 reference e. coli strains. although small differences were seen within the st131 strains, the tree built on the optical maps showed that these strains belonged to a specific cluster (86% similarity) with only 45% similarity with the other group b2 strains and 25% with strains of group a and d. thus, the st131 clone has a genetic composition that differs from other group b2 strains, and appears to be less virulent than previously suspected.  an ongoing outbreak of exceptionally virulent shiga toxin (stx)-producing escherichia coli o104:h4 centered in germany, has caused over 830 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) and 46 deaths since may 2011. serotype o104:h4, which has not been detected in animals, has rarely been associated with hus in the past. to prospectively elucidate the unique characteristics of this strain in the early stages of this outbreak, we applied whole genome sequencing on the life technologies ion torrent pgm™ sequencer and optical mapping to characterize one outbreak isolate (lb226692) and a historic o104:h4 hus isolate from 2001 (01-09591). reference guided draft assemblies of both strains were completed with the newly introduced pgm™ within 62 hours. the hus-associated strains both carried genes typically found in two types of pathogenic e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli (eaec) and enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec). phylogenetic analyses of 1,144 core e. coli genes indicate that the hus-causing o104:h4 strains and the previously published sequence of the eaec strain 55989 show a close relationship but are only distantly related to common ehec serotypes. though closely related, the outbreak strain differs from the 2001 strain in plasmid content and fimbrial genes. we propose a model in which eaec 55989 and ehec o104:h4 strains evolved from a common ehec o104:h4 progenitor, and suggest that by stepwise gain and loss of chromosomal and plasmid-encoded virulence factors, a highly pathogenic hybrid of eaec and ehec emerged as the current outbreak clone. in conclusion, rapid next-generation technologies facilitated prospective whole genome characterization in the early stages of an outbreak.
background in saccharomyces cerevisiae, three out of the four histone gene pairs (hta1-htb1, hht1-hhf1, and hht2-hhf2) are regulated by the hir co-repressor complex. the histone chaperone rtt106 has recently been shown to be present at these histone gene loci throughout the cell cycle in a hir- and asf1-dependent manner and involved in their transcriptional repression. the swi/snf and rsc chromatin remodeling complexes are both recruited to the hir-dependent histone genes; swi/snf is required for their activation in s phase, whereas rsc is implicated in their repression outside of s phase. even though their presence at the histone genes is dependent on the hir complex, their specific recruitment has not been well characterized. in this study we focused on characterizing the role played by the histone chaperone rtt106 in the cell cycle-dependent recruitment of swi/snf and rsc complexes to the histone genes. methodology/principal findings using gst pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that rtt106 physically interacts with both the swi/snf and rsc complexes in vitro and in vivo. we then investigated the function of this interaction with respect to the recruitment of these complexes to hir-dependent histone genes. using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (chip), we found that rtt106 is important for the recruitment of both swi/snf and rsc complexes to the hir-dependent histone genes. furthermore, using synchronized cell cultures, we showed by chip assays that the rtt106-dependent swi/snf recruitment to these histone gene loci is cell cycle regulated and restricted to late g1 phase just before the peak of histone gene expression in s phase. conclusions/significance overall, these data strongly suggest that the interaction between the histone chaperone rtt106 and both the swi/snf and rsc chromatin remodeling complexes is important for the cell cycle regulated recruitment of these two complexes to the hir-dependent histone genes.  genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the evolutionarily conserved swi/snf complex acts at a subset of genes to help transcriptional activators function on chromatin templates. the mechanism by which this complex is targeted to specific chromosomal loci remains unknown. we show that swi/snf is required for expression of the yeast histone hta1-htb1 locus because of the role of hir1p and hir2p corepressors in negatively regulating transcription. snf5p, snf2p/swi2p, and swi3p, three components of the yeast swi/snf complex, coimmunoprecipitate with each hir protein, and snf5p is maximally associated with the hta1-htb1 promoter when the hir-based repression system is intact and the swi/snf complex is functional. the data support a role for the hir repressors in the gene-specific targeting of swi/snf.
recent studies have revealed the physiological significance of post-translational lysine acylations such as acetylation in the regulation of various cellular processes. here, we characterized lysine propionylation, a recently discovered post-translational acylation, in five representative bacteria: geobacillus kaustophilus, thermus thermophilus, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, and rhodothermus marinus. using antibody-based propionyl peptide enrichment followed by identification with nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that proteins were subject to lysine propionylation in all five bacterial species analyzed. notably, many propionylations were identified in the bacillus-related, thermophilic eubacterium g. kaustophilus, but fewer in the mesophilic eubacterium b. subtilis, suggesting that propionylation event abundance is independent of phylogenetic relationship. we further found propionylation sites in the thermophilic eubacterium t. thermophilus, but the thermophilic eubacterium r. marinus showed the fewest number of sites, indicating that growth temperature is not a determinant of propionylation state. in silico analyses demonstrated that lysine propionylation is related to metabolic pathways, particularly those controlled by acyl-coa synthetases, similar to lysine acetylation. we also detected dozens of propionylation sites at positions important for protein functions across bacteria, demonstrating the regulatory mechanisms affected by lysine propionylations. our proteome-wide analyses across bacteria thus provide insights into the general functions of lysine propionylation.  recent studies of protein post-translational modifications revealed that various types of lysine acylation occur in eukaryotic and bacterial proteins. lysine propionylation, a newly discovered type of acylation, occurs in several proteins, including some histones. in this study, we identified 361 propionylation sites in 183 mid-exponential phase and late stationary phase proteins from thermus thermophilus hb8, an extremely thermophilic eubacterium. functional classification of the propionylproteins revealed that the number of propionylation sites in metabolic enzymes increased in late stationary phase, irrespective of protein abundance. the propionylation sites on proteins expressed in mid-exponential and late stationary phases partially overlapped. furthermore, amino acid frequencies in the vicinity of propionylation sites differed, not only between the two growth phases but also relative to acetylation sites. in addition, 33.8% of mid-exponential phase–specific and 80.0% of late stationary phase–specific propionylations (n ≥ 2) implied that specific mechanisms regulate propionylation in the cell. moreover, the limited degree of overlap between lysine propionylation (36.8%) and acetylation (49.2%) sites in 67 proteins that were both acetylated and propionylated strongly suggested that the two acylation reactions are regulated separately by specific enzymes and may serve different functions. finally, we also found that eight propionylation sites overlapped with acetylation sites critical for protein functions such as schiff-base formation and ligand binding.
abstract investigation of a modifier locus displaying a darker eye phenotype in white-apricot flies led to the isolation of the gene encoding udp-glucose dehydrogenase (udpgdh). the p-element insertion  l(3)05007 occurs upstream of the transcription start site of the sugarless (sgl) gene and greatly reduces its transcription at various developmental stages. a single abundant sgl transcript shows a ubiquitous distribution and encodes a 53-kda protein which is 64% identical in sequence to bovine udp-glucose dehydrogenase. overexpression of sgl in e. coli resulted in synthesis of a protein with high levels of udpgdh activity. expression of three genes that participate in pigment deposition, white, scarlet and brown, was significantly affected in populations segregating for sgl, suggesting that it is the decrease in udpgdh level that produces the modifying effect observed. in addition, genetic effects on white-apricot were observed in sgl-wingless and sgl-hedgehog double mutants. recent data have indicated an effect of udpgdh on cell surface glycosaminoglycans (gags) which modulate the activity of growth factors, and in particular wingless signaling. our results suggest that the levels of gags are rate limiting for cell-cell signaling pathways which mediate changes in gene expression.  in vitro experiments suggest that glycosaminoglycans (gags) and the proteins to which they are attached (proteoglycans) are important for modulating growth factor signaling. however, in vivo evidence to support this view has been lacking, in part because mutations that disrupt the production of gag polymers and the core proteins have not been available. here we describe the identification and characterization of drosophila mutants in the suppenkasper (ska) gene. the ska gene encodes udp-glucose dehydrogenase which produces glucuronic acid, an essential component for the synthesis of heparan and chondroitin sulfate. ska mutants fail to put heparan side chains on proteoglycans such as syndecan. surprisingly, mutant embryos produced by germ-line clones of this general metabolic gene exhibit embryonic cuticle phenotypes strikingly similar to those that result from loss-of-function mutations in genes of the wingless (wg) signaling pathway. zygotic loss of ska leads to reduced growth of imaginal discs and pattern defects similar to wg mutants. in addition, genetic interactions of ska with wg and dishevelled mutants are observed. these data demonstrate the importance of proteoglycans and gags in wg signaling in vivo and suggest that wnt-like growth factors may be particularly sensitive to perturbations of gag biosynthesis.
connexin 43 (cx43) deficiency increases myocardial tolerance to ischemia–reperfusion injury and abolishes preconditioning protection. it is not known whether modifications in baseline signaling through protective risk or safe pathways or in response to preconditioning may contribute to these effects. to answer this question we used cx43cre−er(t)/fl mice, in which cx43 expression is abolished after 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-oht) administration. isolated hearts from cx43cre−er(t)/fl mice, or from cx43fl/fl controls, treated with vehicle or 4-oht, were submitted to global ischemia (40 min) and reperfusion. cx43 deficiency was associated with reduced infarct size after ischemia–reperfusion (11.17 ± 3.25 % vs. 65.04 ± 3.79, 59.31 ± 5.36 and 65.40 ± 4.91, in cx43fl/fl animals treated with vehicle, cx43fl/fl mice treated with 4-oht, and cx43cre−er(t)/fl mice treated with vehicle, respectively, n = 8–9, p < 0.001). however, the ratio phosphorylated/total protein expression for akt, erk-1/2, gsk3β and stat3 was not increased in normoxic samples from animals lacking cx43. instead, a reduction in the phosphorylation state of gsk3β was observed in cx43-deficient mice (ratio: 0.15 ± 0.02 vs. 0.56 ± 0.11, 0.77 ± 0.15, and 0.46 ± 0.14, respectively, n = 5–6, p < 0.01). furthermore, ischemic preconditioning (ipc, 4 cycles of 3.5 min of ischemia and 5 min of reperfusion) increased phosphorylation of erk-1/2, gsk3β, and stat3 in all hearts without differences between groups (n = 5–6, p < 0.05), although cx43 deficient mice were not protected by either ipc or pharmacological preconditioning with diazoxide. our data demonstrate that modification of risk and safe signaling does not contribute to the role of cx43 in the increased tolerance to myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury and in preconditioning protection.  activation of several protein kinases occurs during myocardial ischaemia and during subsequent reperfusion. in contrast to the intensive investigation into the significance of kinase activation in cardioprotection, relatively little is known about the role of the phosphatases in this regard. the aim of this study was to re-evaluate the putative roles of pp1 and pp2a in ischaemia/reperfusion and in triggering ischaemic preconditioning. isolated perfused working rat hearts were subjected to sustained global (15 or 20 min) or regional ischaemia (35 min), followed by reperfusion. hearts were preconditioned using global ischaemia (1 × 5 or 3 × 5 min, alternated with 5 min reperfusion). to inhibit both pp1 and pp2a cantharidin (5 μm) was used. to inhibit pp2a only, okadaic acid (7.5 nm) was used. the drugs were administered during the preconditioning protocol, before onset of sustained ischaemia (pretreatment) or during reperfusion. endpoints were mechanical recovery during reperfusion, infarct size and activation of pkb/akt, p38 mapk and erk p42/p44, as determined by western blot. pretreatment of hearts with okadaic acid or cantharidin caused a significant reduction in mechanical recovery after 15 or 20 min global ischaemia. administration of the drugs during an ischaemic preconditioning protocol abolished functional recovery during reperfusion and significantly increased infarct size. administration of the drugs during reperfusion had no deleterious effects and increased functional recovery in 3 × pc hearts. to find an explanation for the differential effects of the inhibitors depending on the time of administration, hearts were freeze-clamped at different time points during the perfusion protocol. administration of cantharidin before 5 min ischaemia activated all kinases. subsequent reperfusion for 5 min without the drug maintained activation of the kinases until the onset of sustained ischaemia. cantharidin given during preconditioning was associated with activation of p38mapk and pkb/akt during reperfusion after sustained ischaemia. however, administration of the drug during reperfusion only after sustained ischaemia caused activation of both pkb/akt and erk p42/p44. phosphatase inhibition immediately prior to the onset of sustained ischaemia or during preconditioning abolishes protection during reperfusion, while inhibition of these enzymes during reperfusion either had no effect or enhanced the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. it is proposed that inhibition of phosphatases during reperfusion may prolong the period of risk activation and hence protect the heart.
the proteolytic system of lactobacillus bulgaricus breaks down milk proteins into peptides and amino acids, which are essential for the growth of the bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the expressions of seven key genes in the proteolytic system under different culturing conditions (different phases, initial ph values, temperatures, and nitrogen sources) using real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). the transcriptions of the seven genes were reduced by 30-fold on average in the stationary phase compared with the exponential growth phase. the transcriptions of the seven genes were reduced by 62.5-, 15.0-, and 59.0-fold in the strains klds 08006, klds 08007, and klds 08012, respectively, indicating that the expressions of the seven genes were significantly different among strains. in addition, the expressions of the seven genes were repressed in the mrs medium containing casein peptone. the effect of peptone supply on pepx transcription was the weakest compared with the other six genes, and the impact on oppd transcription was the strongest. moreover, the expressions of the seven genes were significantly different among different strains (p<0.05). all these results indicated that the culturing conditions affected the expression of the proteolytic system genes in lactobacillus bulgaricus at the transcription level.概要目的研究不同培养条件(不同生长阶段、初始ph值、培养温度和氮源)对保加利亚乳杆菌蛋白水解体系关键蛋白酶基因表达的影响。创新点首次证明在脱脂乳中培养保加利亚乳杆菌可以显著增加蛋白酶体系中关键酶基因表达, 而在mrs培养基中, 关键酶基因表达则显著下调。方法应用实时荧光定量聚合酶链反应(qrt-pcr)技术, 测定不同生长阶段的3株保加利亚乳杆菌(klds 08006、klds 08007和klds 08012)中7种关键酶基因表达的动态变化规律。结论研究发现保加利亚乳杆菌的初始ph值、氮源和培养阶段影响关键酶基因的表达。稳定生长期的7个蛋白酶基因表达比指数生长期的表达平均下降30倍, 其中klds 08006、klds 08007和klds 08012菌株的7个蛋白酶基因表达分别下降62.5、15.0和59.0倍。菌株间的7个蛋白酶基因表达显著不同。研究发现含有酪蛋白胨的mrs培养基抑制7个蛋白酶基因表达, 其中对pepx基因表达影响最弱, 而对oppd基因表达影响最强。  abstract lactobacillus helveticus strains possess an efficient proteolytic system that releases peptides which are essential for lactobacillus growth in various fermented dairy products and also affect textural properties or biological activities. cell envelope proteinases (ceps) are bacterial enzymes that hydrolyze milk proteins. in the case of l. helveticus, two ceps with low percentages of amino acid identity have been described, i.e., prth and prth2. however, the distribution of the genes that encode ceps still remains unclear, rendering it difficult to further control the formation of particular peptides. this study evaluated the diversity of genes that encode ceps in a collection of strains of l. helveticus isolated from various biotopes, both in terms of the presence or absence of these genes and in terms of nucleotide sequence, and studied their transcription in dairy matrices. after defining three sets of primers for both the prth and prth2 genes, we studied the distribution of the genes by using pcr and southern blotting experiments. the prth2 gene was ubiquitous in the 29 strains of l. helveticus studied, whereas only 18 of them also exhibited the prth gene. sequencing of a 350-bp internal fragment of these genes revealed the existence of intraspecific diversity. finally, expression of these two cep-encoding genes was followed during the growth in dairy matrices of two strains, itg lh77 and cnrz32, which possess one and two cep-encoding genes, respectively. both genes were shown to be expressed by l. helveticus at each stage of growth in milk and at different stages of mini-swiss-type cheese making and ripening.
divergent transcription occurs at the majority of rna polymerase ii (rnapii) promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells (mescs), and this activity correlates with cpg islands. here we report the characterization of upstream antisense transcription in regions encoding transcription start site associated rnas (tssa-rnas) at four divergent cpg island promoters: isg20l1, tcea1, txn1, and sf3b1. we find that upstream antisense rnas (uarnas) have distinct capped 5′ termini and heterogeneous nonpolyadenylated 3′ ends. uarnas are short-lived with average half-lives of 18 minutes and are present at 1–4 copies per cell, approximately one rna per dna template. exosome depletion stabilizes uarnas. these uarnas are probably initiation products because their capped termini correlate with peaks of paused rnapii. the pausing factors nelf and dsif are associated with these antisense polymerases and their sense partners. knockdown of either nelf or dsif results in an increase in the levels of uarnas. consistent with p-tefb controlling release from pausing, treatment with its inhibitor, flavopiridol, decreases uarna and nascent mrna transcripts with similar kinetics. finally, isg20l1 induction reveals equivalent increases in transcriptional activity in sense and antisense directions. together these data show divergent polymerases are regulated after p-tefb recruitment with uarna levels controlled by the exosome.  transcription initiation by rna polymerase ii (rnapii) is thought to occur unidirectionally from most genes. here, we present evidence of widespread divergent transcription at protein-encoding gene promoters. transcription start site–associated rnas (tssa-rnas) nonrandomly flank active promoters, with peaks of antisense and sense short rnas at 250 nucleotides upstream and 50 nucleotides downstream of tsss, respectively. northern analysis shows that tssa-rnas are subsets of an rna population 20 to 90 nucleotides in length. promoter-associated rnapii and h3k4-trimethylated histones, transcription initiation hallmarks, colocalize at sense and antisense tssa-rna positions; however, h3k79-dimethylated histones, characteristic of elongating rnapii, are only present downstream of tsss. these results suggest that divergent transcription over short distances is common for active promoters and may help promoter regions maintain a state poised for subsequent regulation.
developmental gene amplification in the ovarian follicle cells of drosophila provides a powerful system for the study of metazoan dna replication. amplification produces 100kb gradients of amplified dna through repeated rounds of origin firing and bidirectional movement of replication forks from these origins. the drosophila follicle cell amplicon at the cytological location 62d, dafc-62d, is uniquely regulated, with two separate rounds of amplification in developmental stages 10 and 13 of egg chamber development. we investigated mechanisms that control the unusual timing of dafc-62d origin activation. we first defined origin sequences in dafc-62d by analyzing the amount of nascent replicative dna across this amplicon. surprisingly, the origin coincides with the coding region of a gene named yellow-g2. orc2 localizes to the origin, as well as two other sites that do not confer origin activity. both orc2 and mcm2-7 display differential association with these sequences, corresponding to the two rounds of amplification. all three elements, dispersed in a 7kb central amplified region, are required for either round of dafc-62d amplification, because deleting any one completely abolished amplification in transposon experiments. preceded by transcription yellow-g2 in stage 12, the late round of origin firing was ablated by the rnapii inhibitor α-amanitin. this effect was absent from other amplicons and insulated transposons, and was stage-13 specific for amplification at either the endogenous dafc-62d or heterologous transposons that did not have functional insulators. therefore amplification at dafc-62d in late follicle cell differentiation depends on transcription in cis. molecularly, blocking rnapii transcription compromises mcm2-7 recruitment. additional transposon and histone modification analyses confirmed the involvement of rnapii in amplification control, which may be facilitated by favorable chromatin structure. this work provides insights in developmental regulation of origin firing, revealing one mechanism for initiation of metazoan dna replication: recruitment of mcm2-7 by rna polymerase ii transcription.  a cluster of drosophila melanogaster chorion genes at locus 66d on the third chromosome amplifies 60-fold in the ovarian follicle cells prior to the onset of gene expression. a 3.8-kilobase (kb) region of the gene cluster can induce tissue-specific amplification in transformants. previous models postulated that amplification is activated in follicle cells by transcription of one of the two chorion genes (s15 and s18) located within the 3.8-kb essential region. in this study, we showed that neither s15 nor s18 chorion gene transcription was required for amplification. however, a 510-bp region upstream from s18 contained sequences essential for both amplification and s18 transcription. no other region within the 3.8-kb fragment was required for amplification. we propose that upstream transcription control elements rather than transcription per se are involved in controlling amplification during development.
backgroundtwo-component systems (tcs) play critical roles in sensing and responding to environmental cues. azospirillum is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium living in the rhizosphere of many important crops. despite numerous studies about its plant beneficial properties, little is known about how the bacterium senses and responds to its rhizospheric environment. the availability of complete genome sequenced from four azospirillum strains (a. brasilense sp245 and cbg 497, a. lipoferum 4b and azospirillum sp. b510) offers the opportunity to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the tcs gene family.resultsazospirillum genomes harbour a very large number of genes encoding tcs, and are especially enriched in hybrid histidine kinases (hyhk) genes compared to other plant-associated bacteria of similar genome sizes. we gained further insight into hyhk structure and architecture, revealing an intriguing complexity of these systems. an unusual proportion of tcs genes were orphaned or in complex clusters, and a high proportion of predicted soluble hks compared to other plant-associated bacteria are reported. phylogenetic analyses of the transmitter and receiver domains of a. lipoferum 4b hyhk indicate that expansion of this family mainly arose through horizontal gene transfer but also through gene duplications all along the diversification of the azospirillum genus. by performing a genome-wide comparison of tcs, we unraveled important ‘genus-defining’ and ‘plant-specifying’ tcs.conclusionsthis study shed light on azospirillum tcs which may confer important regulatory flexibility. collectively, these findings highlight that azospirillum genomes have broad potential for adaptation to fluctuating environments.  magnifying genomes (mage) is a microbial genome annotation system based on a relational database containing information on bacterial genomes, as well as a web interface to achieve genome annotation projects. our system allows one to initiate the annotation of a genome at the early stage of the finishing phase. mage's main features are (i) integration of annotation data from bacterial genomes enhanced by a gene coding re-annotation process using accurate gene models, (ii) integration of results obtained with a wide range of bioinformatics methods, among which exploration of gene context by searching for conserved synteny and reconstruction of metabolic pathways, (iii) an advanced web interface allowing multiple users to refine the automatic assignment of gene product functions. mage is also linked to numerous well-known biological databases and systems. our system has been thoroughly tested during the annotation of complete bacterial genomes (acinetobacter baylyi adp1, pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, frankia alni) and is currently used in the context of several new microbial genome annotation projects. in addition, mage allows for annotation curation and exploration of already published genomes from various genera (e.g. yersinia, bacillus and neisseria). mage can be accessed at .
background: modern implant systems used in the cervical region do not allow for the ingrowth of peri-implant mucosa. the aim of the present study was to use a laser to modify titanium implants used in that region in order to promote mucosa ingrowth, thereby creating a biological barrier against bacterial infection. methods: a krf-excimer laser (λ=248 nm) was used (τ=30 ns, fmax=50 hz, emax=1.2 j). craters were generated, under normal atmospheric conditions or in vacuum, in the polished regions of 18 frialit 2 implants. surface analysis was performed using a scanning electron microscope, an energy dispersive x-ray technique, and profile analysis. results: by adjusting the parameters used, it was possible to create canals with widths of up to 100 μm and depths of 450 μm. canal morphology was influenced by the laser energy and the surrounding atmospheric conditions. irradiation with 3,000 pulses (650 mj per pulse) resulted in rough surfaces under normal atmospheric conditions, whereas these parameters resulted in smooth surfaces in vacuum. the surface chemistry was also influenced by the laser parameters used. conclusion: laser-assisted modification of titanium surfaces permits fabrication of 3-d surface modifications. the surface chemistry can also be influenced, depending upon the parameters chosen. further studies are necessary to evaluate whether ingrowth of mucosa into the canals can be realized.  purpose titanium endosseous implants are becoming increasingly important in dentistry because of their excellent long-term results. however, it has been reported that these implants may lead to higher concentrations of titanium, especially in the lungs and kidneys. the purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine whether co2 laser-assisted decontamination of exposed implant surfaces is associated with an increase in titanium release.   materials and methods in 6 beagle dogs, a total of 60 implants were placed. after osseointegration and second-stage surgery, peri-implantitis was induced by cotton floss ligatures for 12 weeks. surgical treatment consisted of granulation tissue removal, including decontamination of the implant surface with 3 different methods. twenty implants were decontaminated conventionally by an air-powder abrasive for 60 seconds. another 20 implants were decontaminated by laser treatment alone. the last 20 implants were treated conventionally by air-powder abrasive and then lased. four months later, fresh tissue samples of various tissues were evaluated by histologic and chemical analysis.   results quantitative analysis indicated that titanium accumulation could be detected, especially in the spleen, liver, oral mucosa, regional lymph nodes, lung, and kidney in the beagle dog model.   discussion the concentrations found did not exceed those previously reported in the literature.   conclusion these results support the hypothesis that co2 laser-assisted therapy of ailing implants will not result in excessive titanium concentrations in tissues. accordingly, co2 lasers appear suitable and safe for peri-implant gingival surgery.
backgrounddespite long-lasting hiv replication control, a significant proportion of elite controller (ec) patients may experience cd4 t-cell loss. discovering perturbations in immunological parameters could help our understanding of the mechanisms that may be operating in those patients experiencing loss of immunological control.methodsa case–control study was performed to evaluate if alterations in different t-cell homeostatic parameters can predict cd4 t-cell loss in ecs by comparing data from ec patients showing significant cd4 decline (cases) and ec patients showing stable cd4 counts (controls). the partial least-squares–class modeling (pls-cm) statistical methodology was employed to discriminate between the two groups of patients, and as a predictive model.resultsherein, we show that among t-cell homeostatic alterations, lower levels of naïve and recent thymic emigrant subsets of cd8 cells and higher levels of effector and senescent subsets of cd8 cells as well as higher levels of exhaustion of cd4 cells, measured prior to cd4 t-cell loss, predict the loss of immunological control.conclusionsthese data indicate that the parameters of t-cell homeostasis may identify those ec patients with a higher proclivity to cd4 t-cell loss. our results may open new avenues for understanding the mechanisms underlying immunological progression despite hiv replication control, and eventually, for finding a functional cure through immune-based clinical trials.  background human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) elite controllers are able to control virus replication to levels below the limits of detection by commercial assays, but the actual level of viremia in these individuals is not well defined. here, we quantify plasma hiv-1 rna in elite controllers and correlate this with specific immunologic parameters.   methods plasma hiv-1 rna levels were quantified in 90 elite controllers with use of a real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay with a sensitivity of 0.2 copies/ml. hiv-1-specific immune responses and longitudinal cd4(+) t cell counts were examined.   results the median plasma hiv-1 rna level was 2 copies/ml (interquartile range, 0.2-14 copies/ml). a longitudinal analysis of 31 elite controllers demonstrated 2-5-fold fluctuations in viremia in the majority of individuals; 6 had persistent levels below 1 copy/ml. viremia correlated directly with hiv-1-specific neutralizing antibodies and western blot reactivity but not with cd8(+) t cell responses. absolute cd4(+) t cell decrease was more common among individuals with detectable viremia (p = .04).   conclusions low-level viremia is present in the majority of elite controllers and is associated with higher hiv-1-specific antibody responses. absolute cd4(+) t cell loss is more common among viremic individuals, suggesting that even very low-level viremia has negative consequences over time.
screening for the early detection of cancer is effective in decreasing morbidity   and mortality, healthcare costs, and disability in the united states. results from   the 2010 national health interview survey indicate that cancer screening rates   among the general population are still well below healthy people 2020 targets.   health fairs are one of the most recognizable methods for community-based   health promotion. due to their frequency, impact and reach, health fairs are of   interest in the promotion of screening. we examined the use of health fairs to   increase breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening in community-based   settings in the u.s. health fair coordinators were recruited and interviewed by   phone from july to september 2012. we used a 72 question interview guide to   collect data on health fair goals, activities, costs, and outcomes. fourteen health   fair coordinators completed the interview. seven of the health fairs focused only   on breast cancer (50%), 3 (21.4%) on colorectal cancer, 3 (21.4%) on breast,   cervical, and colorectal cancer, and 1 (7.1%) on breast and cervical cancer. about   80% of the health fairs partnered with hospital or clinics. overall, the coordinators   used of a combination of two or more of the following activities: booths/fair   (78.6%), presentations/ lectures (50%), meal/snack (50%), screening/ referral   (50%), give away/ raffle (42.9%), media/entertainment (21.4%). health fair   activities were categorized into community guide for preventive services   recommended interventions to promote screening: small media (100%), one-onone   education (92.9%), reducing structural barriers (92.9%), group education   (57.1%), and reducing out of pocket costs (64.3%). screening outcomes varied   widely with most health fairs resulting in 30-45 screenings. three separate case   studies of health fairs held in the u.s. between 2010 and 2012 are presented. with   the dearth of literature on using health fairs to increase cancer screenings, this   study provides important information on the implementation, reach, and impact   of health fairs in increasing breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening.  introduction increasing public awareness and knowledge about the need for colorectal cancer (crc) screening among american indians is key to reducing health disparities. the objective of this study was to assess navajo adults' knowledge of crc risk factors and prevention, crc screening, and self-reported experience with crc screening. methods we collected data generated by a self-administered survey given to navajo adults, most of whom lived on the reservation. data were collected at 2 annual tribal fairs in 2006. fair attendees who visited an exhibit booth completed a crc knowledge survey. the study design was nonrandomized. results of the 285 navajo adults who participated, most were bilingual (74%) and female (80%). of the respondents aged 50 years or older, 77% had heard of crc screening and 28% reported being screened for colon or colorectal cancer. knowledge was high (mean, 5.78 [standard deviation (sd), 1.28]) (8.0 was the highest possible knowledge score). respondents with little or no formal schooling had lower scores (mean, 5.4), indicating less knowledge of crc and associated screening tests than did those with more education (mean, 6.0). conclusion among a sample of navajo adults aged 50 years or older, participants with more education were more likely to be knowledgeable about crc and to have received screening. this survey, led by a navajo investigator with navajo surveyors, revealed a high awareness of crc and screening, but overall crc screening was low. crc education for navajo adults who have little or no formal schooling should be improved.
human respiratory syncytial virus group a (rsv‐a) was detected in symptomatic hospital attended children in central spain for a continuous time period, september 2010 to april 2015. in order to accurately describe the epidemiology of this virus, the genetic diversity of the complete g gene and the clinical manifestations observed were jointly analyzed. out of 3,011 respiratory specimens taken from 2,308 children, 640 were positive to rsv (21.3%) and 405 were rsv‐a (63.2%). complete g gene sequences of 166 randomly selected rsv‐a virus identified na1 and on1 genotypes. in 2011–2012, on1 emerged sporadically and become dominant in 2012–2013 with 38 cases (70%). in 2014–2015, all the 44 sequences contained the 72‐nt duplication (100%). clinical diagnosis of children with on1 genotype were bronchiolitis in 55 (62.5%), recurrent wheezing or asthma exacerbations in 22 (25%), laryngotracheobronchitis in 3 (3.4%), and upper respiratory tract infections in eight. results showed replacement and substitution of circulating na1 genotype with the new on1 genotype. nevertheless, at this stage, none of the rsv‐a genotypes identified have resulted in significant clinical differences. the amino acid composition of the complete g gene on1 sequences demonstrated an accumulation of single changes not related with different clinical presentation. j. med. virol. 89:767–774, 2017. © 2016 wiley periodicals, inc.  human respiratory syncytial virus (hrsv) is the main cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children under 2 years of age and causes repeated infections throughout life. we investigated the genetic variability of rsv-a circulating in ontario during 2010–2011 winter season by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the g glycoprotein gene. among the 201 consecutive rsv isolates studied, rsv-a (55.7%) was more commonly observed than rsv-b (42.3%). 59.8% and 90.1% of rsv-a infections were among children ≤12 months and ≤5 years old, respectively. on phylogenetic analysis of the second hypervariable region of the 112 rsv-a strains, 110 (98.2%) clustered within or adjacent to the na1 genotype; two isolates were ga5 genotype. eleven (10%) na1-related isolates clustered together phylogenetically as a novel rsv-a genotype, named on1, containing a 72 nucleotide duplication in the c-terminal region of the attachment (g) glycoprotein. the predicted polypeptide is lengthened by 24 amino acids and includes a23 amino acid duplication. using rna secondary structural software, a possible mechanism of duplication occurrence was derived. the 23 amino acid on1 g gene duplication results in a repeat of 7 potential o-glycosylation sites including three o-linked sugar acceptors at residues 270, 275, and 283. using phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood analysis, a total of 19 positively selected sites were observed among ontario na1 isolates; six were found to be codons which reverted to the previous state observed in the prototype rsv-a2 strain. the tendency of codon regression in the g-ectodomain may infer a decreased avidity of antibody to the current circulating strains. further work is needed to document and further understand the emergence, virulence, pathogenicity and transmissibility of this novel rsv-a genotype with a72 nucleotide g gene duplication.
alternative polyadenylation (apa) is a widespread gene regulatory mechanism that generates mrnas with different 3′-ends, allowing them to interact with different sets of rna regulators such as micrornas and rna-binding proteins. recent studies have shown that during development, neural tissues produce mrnas with particularly long 3′utrs, suggesting that such extensions might be important for neural development and function. despite this, the mechanisms underlying neural apa are not well understood. here, we investigate this problem within the drosophila nervous system, focusing on the roles played by general cleavage and polyadenylation factors (cpa factors). in particular, we examine the model that modulations in cpa factor concentration may affect apa during development. for this, we first analyse the expression of the drosophila orthologues of all mammalian cpa factors and note that their expression decreases during embryogenesis. in contrast to this global developmental decrease in cpa factor expression, we see that cleavage factor i (cfi) expression is actually elevated in the late embryonic central nervous system, suggesting that cfi might play a special role in neural tissues. to test this, we use the uas/gal4 system to deplete cfi proteins from neural tissue and observe that in this condition, multiple genes switch their apa patterns, demonstrating a role of cfi in apa control during drosophila neural development. furthermore, analysis of genes with 3′utr extensions of different length leads us to suggest a novel relation between 3′utr length and sensitivity to cpa factor expression. our work thus contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms of apa control within the developing central nervous system.  cleavage factor i(m) (cfi(m)) is a highly conserved component of the eukaryotic mrna 3' processing machinery that functions in sequence-specific poly(a) site recognition through the collaboration of a 25 kda subunit containing a nudix domain and a larger subunit of 59, 68, or 72 kda containing an rna recognition motif (rrm). our previous work demonstrated that cfi(m)25 is both necessary and sufficient for sequence-specific binding of the poly(a) site upstream element ugua. here, we report the crystal structure of cfi(m)25 complexed with the rrm domain of cfi(m)68 and rna. the cfi(m)25 dimer is clasped on opposite sides by two cfi(m)68 rrm domains. each cfi(m)25 subunit binds one ugua element specifically. biochemical analysis indicates that the cfi(m)68 rrms serve to enhance rna binding and facilitate rna looping. the intrinsic ability of cfi(m) to direct rna looping may provide a mechanism for its function in the regulation of alternative poly(a) site selection.
time-resolved fourier transform infrared (ftir) difference spectra of the halorhodopsin (hr) photocycle have been collected from 3 micros to 100 ms in saturating concentrations of kcl or kbr. kinetic analysis of these data revealed two decay processes, with time constants of tau(1) approximately 150 micros and tau(2) approximately 16 ms in the presence of either halide, with tau(2) describing the return to the starting (hr) state. comparison to previous low-temperature ftir spectra of hr intermediates confirms that characteristic hk and hl spectral features are both present before the tau(1) decay, in a state previously defined as hk(l) (dioumaev, a., and m. braiman. 1997. photochem. photobiol. 66:755-763). however, the relative sizes of these features depend on which halide is present. in br-, the hl features are clearly more dominant than in cl-. therefore, the state present before tau(1) is probably best described as an hk(l)/hl(1) equilibrium, instead of a single hk(l) state. different halides affect the relative amounts of hk(l) and hl(1) present, i.e., cl- produces a much more significant back-reaction from hl(1) to hk(l) than does br-. the halide dependence of this back-reaction could therefore explain the halide selectivity of the halorhodopsin anion pump.  abstract— step‐scan fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with 50 ns time resolution was applied to the early stages of the photocycle of halorhodopsin (hr) for the temperature range 3‐42° c. kinetic data analysis with global fitting revealed two distinct kinetic processes associated with relaxations of the early red‐shifted photoproduct hk; these processes have time constants t1⋍ 280 ns and t2⋍ 360 μs at 20°c. spectral features demonstrate that the t1 process corresponds to a transition between two distinct bathointermediates, hke and hkl. the vibrational difference bands associated with both t1 and t2 transitions are spread throughout the whole 1800‐900 cm−1 range. however, the largest bands correspond to ethylenic c=c stretches, fingerprint c‐c stretches and hydrogen out‐of‐plane (hoop) wags of the retinal chromophore. the time evolution of these difference bands indicate that both the t1 and t2 decay processes involve principally a relaxation of the chromophore and its immediate environment. the decay of the intense hoop vibrations is nearly equally divided between the t1 and t2 processes, indicating a complex chromophore relaxation from a twisted nonrelaxed conformation in the primary (hke) bathointermediate, to a less‐twisted structure in hkl, and finally to a roughly planar structure in the hypsochromically shifted hl intermediate. this conclusion is also supported by the unexpectedly large positive entropy of activation observed for the t1 process. the two relaxations from hke to hl are largely analogous to corresponding relaxations (ke→ kl→ l) in the bacterior‐hodopsin photocycle, except that the second step is slowed down by over 200‐fold in hr.
the present experiment examined the effects of varying stimulus disparity and relative punisher frequencies on signal detection by humans. participants were placed into one of two groups. group 3 participants were presented with 1:3 and 3:1 punisher frequency ratios, while group 11 participants were presented with 1:11 and 11:1 punisher frequency ratios. for both groups, stimulus disparity was varied across three levels (low, medium, high) for each punisher ratio. in all conditions, correct responses were intermittently reinforced (1:1 reinforcer frequency ratio). participants were mostly biased away from the more punished alternative, with more extreme response biases found for group 11 participants compared to group 3. for both groups, estimates of discriminability increased systematically across the three disparity levels and were unaffected by the punisher ratios. likewise, estimates of response bias and sensitivity to the punisher ratios were unaffected by changes in discriminability, supporting the assumption of parameter invariance in the davison and tustin (1978) model of signal detection. overall, the present experiment found no relation between stimulus control and punisher control, and provided further evidence for similar but opposite effects of punishers to reinforcers in signal-detection procedures.  three experiments using human participants varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers or point-loss punishers in two-alternative signal-detection procedures. experiment 1 varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers for correct responses (group a) and point-loss punishers for errors (group b) across conditions. response bias varied systematically as a function of the relative reinforcer or punisher frequencies. experiment 2 arranged two conditions - one where an unequal ratio of reinforcement (5ratio1 or 1ratio5) was presented without punishment (r-only), and another where the same reinforcer ratio was presented with an equal distribution of point-loss punishers (r+p). response bias was significantly greater in the r-only condition than the r+p condition, supporting a subtractive model of punishment. experiment 3 varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers for correct responses across four unequal reinforcer ratios (5ratio1, 2ratio1, 1ratio2, 1ratio5) both without (r-only) and with (r+p) an equal distribution of point-loss punishers for errors. response bias varied systematically with changes in relative reinforcer frequency for both r-only and r+p conditions, with 5 out of 8 participants showing increases in sensitivity estimates from r-only to r+p conditions. overall, the results indicated that punishers have similar but opposite effects to reinforcers in detection procedures and that combined reinforcer and punisher effects might be better modeled by a subtractive punishment model than an additive punishment model, consistent with research using concurrent-schedule choice procedures.
neomycin is a large, positively charged, aminoglycoside antibiotic that has previously been shown to induce a voltage-dependent substate block in the cardiac isoform of the ryanodine receptor (ryr2). it was proposed that block involved an electrostatic interaction between neomycin and putative regions of negative charge in both the cytosolic and luminal mouths of the pore. in this study, we have attempted to screen charge by increasing potassium concentration in single-channel experiments. neomycin block is apparent at both cytosolic and luminal faces of the channel in all k+ concentrations tested and alterations in k+ concentration have no effect on the amplitudes of the neomycin-induced substates. however, the kinetics of both cytosolic and luminal block are sensitive to changes in k+ concentration. in both cases increasing the k+ concentration leads to an increase in dissociation constant (kd). underlying these changes are marked increases in rates of dissociation (k(off)), with little change in rates of association (k(on)). the increase in k(off) is more marked at the luminal face of the channel. changes in k+ concentration also result in alterations in the voltage dependence of block. we have interpreted these data as supporting the proposal that neomycin block of ryr2 involves electrostatic interactions with the polycation forming a poorly fitting "plug" in the mouths of the conduction pathway. these observations emphasize the usefulness of neomycin as a probe for regions of charge in both the cytosolic and luminal mouths of the ryr2 pore.  charybdotoxin (ctx), a small, basic protein from scorpion venom, strongly inhibits the conduction of k ions through high-conductance, ca2+-activated k+ channels. the interaction of ctx with ca2+-activated k+ channels from rat skeletal muscle plasma membranes was studied by inserting single channels into uncharged planar phospholipid bilayers. ctx blocks k+ conduction by binding to the external side of the channel, with an apparent dissociation constant of approximately 10 nm at physiological ionic strength. the dwell-time distributions of both blocked and unblocked states are single-exponential. the toxin association rate varies linearly with the ctx concentration, and the dissociation rate is independent of it. ctx is competent to block both open and closed channels; the association rate is sevenfold faster for the open channel, while the dissociation rate is the same for both channel conformations. membrane depolarization enhances the ctx dissociation rate e-fold/28 mv; if the channel's open probability is maintained constant as voltage varies, then the toxin association rate is voltage independent. increasing the external solution ionic strength from 20 to 300 mm (with k+, na+, or arginine+) reduces the association rate by two orders of magnitude, with little effect on the dissociation rate. we conclude that ctx binding to the ca2+-activated k+ channel is a bimolecular process, and that the ctx interaction senses both voltage and the channel's conformational state. we further propose that a region of fixed negative charge exists near the channel's ctx-binding site.
background:peripheral blood-derived inflammation-based scores such as the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (nlr) and platelet–lymphocyte ratio (plr) have recently been proposed as prognostic markers in solid tumours. although evidence to support these markers as unfavourable prognostic factors is more compelling in gastrointestinal cancers, very little is known of their impact on breast cancer. we investigated the association between the nlr and plr, and overall survival after breast cancer.methods:data from the university of malaya medical centre breast cancer registry was used. of 2059 consecutive patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2008, we included 1435 patients with an available pre-treatment differential blood count (∼70%). patients were stratified into quintiles of the nlr/plr. multivariable cox regression was used to determine the independent prognostic significances of the nlr/plr.results:compared with the first quintile of the nlr, women in quintile 5 were younger, had bigger tumours, nodal involvement, distant metastases and higher tumour grades. higher nlr quintiles were significantly associated with poorer survival with a 5-year relative survival ratio (rsr) of 76.4% (95% ci: 69.6–82.1%) in quintile 1, 79.4% (95% ci: 74.4–83.7%) in quintile 2, 72.1% (95% ci: 66.3–77.3%) in quintile 3, 65.6% (95% ci: 59.8–70.8%) in quintile 4 and 51.1% (95% ci: 43.3–58.5%) in quintile 5. following adjustment for demography, tumour characteristics, treatment and the plr, the adjusted hazard ratio (hr) for quintile 5 vs quintile 1 was 1.50 (95% ci: 1.08–1.63); ptrend=0.004. results were unchanged when the nlr was analysed as a dichotomous variable using different cutoff points. although patients in plr quintile 5 had lower survival than in quintile 1 (5-year rsr: 53.2% (95% ci: 46.9–59.2%) vs 77.0% (95% ci: 70.9–82.2%)), this association was not significant after multivariable adjustment. however, a plr >185 was significantly associated with poorer survival; adjusted hr: 1.25 (95% ci: 1.04–1.52).conclusions:both the nlr and plr are independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in breast cancer. their added value in the prognostication of breast cancer in clinical practice warrants investigation.  background: inflammation influences cancer development and progression. an elevated platelet to lymphocyte ratio (plr), a marker of inflammation, has been linked to poor prognosis in several malignancies. here, we quantify the prognostic impact of this biomarker. methods: a systematic review of databases was conducted to identify publications exploring the association of blood plr and overall survival (os) in solid tumors. data were pooled in a meta-analysis. pooled hrs for os by disease group and by plr cutoff groups were computed and weighted using generic inverse-variance and random-effect modeling. results: twenty studies comprising 12,754 patients were assessed. cutoffs for plr defining risk groups ranged from 150 to 300 and were dichotomous (12 studies; group 1) or split into three groups (<150/150–300/>300, 8 studies; group 2). higher plr was associated with significantly worse os in group 1 [hr = 1.87; 95% confidence interval (ci, 1.49–2.34); p < 0.001] and with a nonsignificant association in group 2 (hr per higher category = 1.21; 95%ci, 0.97–1.50; p = 0.10). the size of effect of plr on os was greater for metastatic disease (hr[group 1] = 2.0; 95% ci, 1.6–2.7; hr[group 2] = 1.6; 95% ci, 1.1–2.4) than for early-stage disease (hr[group 1] = 1.5; 95% ci, 1.0–2.2; hr[group 2] = 1.0; 95% ci, 0.8–1.3). a significant association was observed for colorectal, hepatocellular, gastroesophageal, ovarian, and pancreatic carcinoma in group 1 and for colorectal cancers in group 2. conclusion: a high plr is associated with worse os in various solid tumors. further research of its regulation and relevance in daily practice is warranted. impact: plr is a readily available and inexpensive biomarker with independent prognostic value in solid tumors. cancer epidemiol biomarkers prev; 23(7); 1204–12. ©2014 aacr.
an association of two techniques, nuclear transfer (nt), and transfection of somatic animal cells, has numerous potential applications and considerable impact, mainly in agriculture, medicine, pharmacy, and fundamental biology. in addition, somatic cell nuclear transfer is the most efficient alternative to produce large transgenic animals. we compared in vitro and in vivo developmental capacities of nt using fibroblast cells isolated from a 14-month-old cloned simmental heifer (fce) vs the same line transfected with a plasmid containing neomycin-resistant genes (tfce). there were no significant differences (p > 0.5) in either fusion (116/149 = 78% vs 216/301 = 72%), cleavage (78/116 = 67% vs 141/216 = 65%) and blastocyst (35/116 = 30% vs 52/216 = 24%) rates or in pregnancy rate at 30 to 35 days after embryo transfer (2/17 vs 3/17) between nt using fce and tfce, respectively. transfection and long-term in vitro culture of transfected cells did not affect developmental capacity of nt embryos up to 40 days of gestation.  the objective of this study was to determine if the transfection of human prourokinase (prou) gene and passage number of transfected ear fibroblasts affected in vitro development of bovine transgenic nuclear transfer (nt) embryos. an expression plasmid for human prou was constructed by inserting a bovine beta-casein promoter, a green fluorescent protein (gfp) marker and human prou gene into a pcdna3 plasmid and transfected into bovine ear fibroblasts using a lipid mediated method. abattoir derived oocytes were enucleated at 18-20 hr post maturation and a single donor cell was transferred into the perivitelline space of a recipient oocyte. after fusion and activation, the couplets were cultured in modified synthetic oviductal fluid (msof) medium for 168 hr. in experiment 1, significantly lower rate in blastocysts formation (10.3%) was observed in transfected donor cells at early passage than that in nontransfected counterparts (22.1%, p<0.05). in experiment 2, development to blastocysts and gfp expression in blastocysts were not significantly different between early (3-7) and late (8-12) passage donor cells (10.3 vs. 11.3% and 54.5 vs. 41.7%, respectively). this study indicates that in vitro development of bovine transgenic nt embryos is negatively influenced by transfection of human prou gene into donor fibroblasts. however, passage number of transfected ear fibroblasts does not affect in vitro development of bovine transgenic nt embryos.
an investigation was made to evaluate the role of anethum graveolens l. (dill) leaf extract in the regulation of corticosteroid‐induced type 2 diabetes mellitus in female rats. in dexamethasone‐treated animals (1 mg/kg for 22 days) an increase in serum concentration of insulin and glucose and in hepatic lipid peroxidation (lpo) was observed. however, there was a decrease in serum concentration of thyroid hormones and in the endogenous antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (sod), catalase (cat) and reduced glutathione (gsh) in liver. in animals treated with an equivalent amount of dexamethasone for a similar period (22 days) when received the leaf extract (100 mg/kg b.wt/d.) for last 15 days a decrease in the concentration of both serum glucose and insulin was observed, indicating the potential of the plant extract in the regulation of corticosteroid‐induced diabetes. dexamethasone‐induced alterations in the levels of thyroid hormones as well as in hepatic lpo, sod, cat and gsh were also reversed by the plant extract. copyright © 2008 john wiley & sons, ltd.  scopoletin (7‐hydroxy‐6‐methoxy coumarin) was isolated from the leaves of aegle marmelos and evaluated for its potential to regulate hyperthyroidism, lipid peroxidation and hyperglycemia in levo‐thyroxine‐induced hyperthyroid rats. scopoletin (1.00 mg/kg, p.o.) administered daily for 7 days to levo‐thyroxine‐treated animals decreased the levels of serum thyroid hormones and glucose as well as hepatic glucose‐6‐phosphatase activity, demonstrating its potential to regulate hyperthyroidism and hyperglycemia. scopoletin also inhibited hepatic lipid peroxidation and increased the activity of antioxidants, superoxide dismutase and catalase. compared with the standard antithyroid drug, propylthiouracil, scopoletin exhibited a superior therapeutic activity, since unlike propylthiouracil, it also inhibited hepatic lipid peroxidation. these findings indicate that scopoletin has the potential to inhibit thyroid function and hyperglycemia without hepatotoxicity. copyright © 2006 john wiley & sons, ltd.
in this study, the antioxidant effect of aminoguanidine on nephrotoxicity of a single dose of cisplatin is investigated and compared with the effects of well-known antioxidants vitamin c and e combination. tubular damage and perivascular inflammation were observed in kidney samples of the cisplatin-administered groups. aminoguanidine and vitamin c-e combination are found to be capable of preventing these effects of cisplatin. liver tissues of all groups were intact. cisplatin-induced oxidative stress was evidenced by significant decrease in glutathione and significant increase in malondialdehyde levels in kidney samples. antioxidants with cisplatin decreased malondialdehyde levels. antioxidants with cisplatin prevented the decrease in liver glutathione levels. the nephrotoxicity was confirmed biochemically by significant elevation of serum urea and creatinine levels. both vitamin c-e combination and aminoguanidine prevented the increase in serum urea levels according to the cisplatin group.  the effect of aminoguanidine (ag) on nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin (cddp) was investigated. a single dose of cddp (7.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced nephrotoxicity, manifested biochemically by a significant elevation in serum urea, creatinine and a severe decrease in serum albumin. moreover, marked increases in kidney weight, urine volume and urinary excretion of albumin were observed. nephrotoxicity was further confirmed by a significant decrease in glutathione-s-transferase (gst, e.c. 2.5.1.18), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px, e.c. 1.11.1.9) and catalase (e.c. 1.11.1.6) and a significant increase in lipid peroxides measured as malondialdhyde (mda) in kidney homogenates. administration of ag (100 mg/kg per day p.o.) in drinking water 5 days before and 5 days after cddp injection produced a significant protection against nephrotoxicity induced by cddp. the amelioration of nephrotoxicity was evidenced by significant reductions in serum urea and creatinine concentrations. in addition, ag tended to normalize decreased levels of serum albumin. urine volume, urinary excretions of albumin and gst and kidney weight were significantly decreased. moreover, ag prevented the rise of mda and the reduction of gst and gsh-px activities in the kidney. these results suggest that ag has a protective effect on nephrotoxicity induced by cddp and it may therefore improve the therapeutic index of cddp.
as we age, the majority of our cells gradually lose the capacity to divide because of replicative senescence that results from the inability to replicate the ends of chromosomes. the timing of senescence is dependent on the length of telomeric dna, which elicits a checkpoint signal when critically short. critically short telomeres also become vulnerable to deleterious rearrangements, end‐degradation and telomere–telomere fusions. here we report a novel role of non‐homologous end‐joining (nhej), a pathway of double‐strand break repair in influencing both the kinetics of replicative senescence and the rate of chromosome loss in telomerase‐deficient saccharomyces cerevisiae. in telomerase‐deficient cells, the absence of nhej delays replicative senescence, decreases loss of viability during senescence, and suppresses senescence‐associated chromosome loss and telomere–telomere fusion. differences in mating‐type gene expression in haploid and diploid cells affect nhej function, resulting in distinct kinetics of replicative senescence. these results suggest that the differences in the kinetics of replicative senescence in haploid and diploid telomerase‐deficient yeast are determined by changes in nhej‐dependent telomere fusion, perhaps through the initiation of the breakage‐fusion‐bridge cycle.  using a model system, we have shown that replicative senescence is accompanied by a 16-fold increase in base substitution and frameshift mutations near a chromosome end. the increase was dependent on error-prone polymerases required for the mutagenic response to dna lesions that block the replication fork.
abstract. the purpose of the study was to characterise statistically the inherent fluctuations in breath-by-breath measurements of pulmonary gas exchange (oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide output, vo2 and vco2, respectively) and pulmonary ventilation (ve) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and to compare them with those of healthy control subjects. thirty subjects with copd [mean (sd): 67 (6) years old; forced expiratory volume in 1 min, fev1 1.25( 0.18) l; 42 (6)% predicted fev1] and 12 healthy subjects [31 (3) years old; fev1 3.62 (0.54) l; 99 (8)% predicted fev1] performed exercise tests on a cycle ergometer at a constant work rate of moderate intensity. steady-state exercise values for vo2, vco2 and ve were 905 (96) ml·min–1, 847(90) ml·min–1 and 23 (3) l·min–1, respectively for the copd patients and 1239(89) ml·min–1, 1191(84) ml·min–1 and 37(3) l·min–1, respectively, for the healthy controls. the breath-by-breath fluctuations were well characterised by a gaussian density-probability function with breath-to-breath autocorrelations that were not significantly different from 0, up to four subsequent breaths. its magnitude varied among variables, but was independent of the signal amplitude for the same subject and variable. with ratios of amplitude of fluctuation:signal of around 10%, typical of the patients studied, the resolution of time constants and amplitude were ≅9 s and ≅100 ml·min–1, respectively for vo2 or vco2 with one repetition.  excess co2 is generated when lactate is increased during exercise because its [h+] is buffered primarily by hco-3 (22 ml for each meq of lactic acid). we developed a method to detect the anaerobic threshold (at), using computerized regression analysis of the slopes of the co2 uptake (vco2) vs. o2 uptake (vo2) plot, which detects the beginning of the excess co2 output generated from the buffering of [h+], termed the v-slope method. from incremental exercise tests on 10 subjects, the point of excess co2 output (at) predicted closely the lactate and hco-3 thresholds. the mean gas exchange at was found to correspond to a small increment of lactate above the mathematically defined lactate threshold [0.50 +/- 0.34 (sd) meq/l] and not to differ significantly from the estimated hco-3 threshold. the mean vo2 at at computed by the v-slope analysis did not differ significantly from the mean value determined by a panel of six experienced reviewers using traditional visual methods, but the at could be more reliably determined by the v-slope method. the respiratory compensation point, detected separately by examining the minute ventilation vs. vco2 plot, was consistently higher than the at (2.51 +/- 0.42 vs. 1.83 +/- 0.30 l/min of vo2). this method for determining the at has significant advantages over others that depend on regular breathing pattern and respiratory chemosensitivity.
cadmium (cd2+) induces renal proximal tubular (pt) damage, including disruption of the e-cadherin/β-catenin complex of adherens junctions (ajs) and apoptosis. yet, chronic cd2+ exposure causes malignant transformation of renal cells. previously, we have demonstrated that cd2+-mediated up-regulation of the multidrug transporter abcb1 causes apoptosis resistance in pt cells. we hypothesized that cd2+ activates adaptive signaling mechanisms mediated by β-catenin to evade apoptosis and increase proliferation. here we show that 50 µm cd2+, which induces cell death via apoptosis and necrosis, also causes a decrease of the trans-epithelial resistance of confluent wkpt-0293 cl.2 cells, a rat renal pt cell model, within 45 min of cd2+ exposure, as measured by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates cd2+-induced decrease of e-cadherin at ajs and redistribution of β-catenin from the e-cadherin/β-catenin complex of ajs to cytosol and nuclei after 3 h. immunoblotting confirms cd2+-induced decrease of e-cadherin expression and translocation of β-catenin to cytosol and nuclei of pt cells. rt-pcr shows cd2+-induced increase of expression of c-myc and of the isoform abcb1a at 3 h. the data prove for the first time that cd2+ induces nuclear translocation of β-catenin in pt cells. we speculate that cd2+ activates β-catenin/t-cell factor signaling to trans-activate proliferation and apoptosis resistance genes and promote carcinogenesis of pt cells.  cadherins and other cell–substrate and cell–cell adhesion molecules play an essential role during development. through their cytoplasmic interaction with the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion molecules physically link cells with the extracellular matrix and/or with each other. these interactions create architectural and structural entities that enable the tissues in the embryo to restrain the physical forces encountered during development. regulated cell adhesion is also often the driving force of morphogenetic movements. this review goes beyond the adhesive aspect of cadherins, focusing on their roles as signaling molecules in development. we discuss how cadherins, through their effects on cell proliferation, cell death, cell polarization, and differentiation, play a role in the formation of tissues and organs in the developing embryo. bioessays 21:211–220, 1999. © 1999 john wiley & sons, inc.
backgroundopen chromatin regions are correlated with active regulatory elements in development and are dysregulated in diseases. the baf (swi/snf) complex is essential for development, and has been demonstrated to remodel reconstituted chromatin in vitro and to control the accessibility of a few individual regions in vivo. however, it remains unclear where and how baf controls the open chromatin landscape to regulate developmental processes, such as human epidermal differentiation.resultsusing a novel “on-plate” atac-sequencing approach for profiling open chromatin landscapes with a low number of adherent cells, we demonstrate that the baf complex is essential for maintaining 11.6 % of open chromatin regions in epidermal differentiation. these baf-dependent open chromatin regions are highly cell-type-specific and are strongly enriched for binding sites for p63, a master epidermal transcription factor. the dna sequences of p63 binding sites intrinsically favor nucleosome formation and are inaccessible in other cell types without p63 to prevent ectopic activation. in epidermal cells, baf and p63 mutually recruit each other to maintain 14,853 open chromatin regions. we further demonstrate that baf and p63 cooperatively position nucleosomes away from p63 binding sites and recruit transcriptional machinery to control tissue differentiation.conclusionsbaf displays high specificity in controlling the open chromatin landscape during epidermal differentiation by cooperating with the master transcription factor p63 to maintain lineage-specific open chromatin regions.  chromatin structure can affect the transcriptional activity of eukaryotic structural genes by blocking access of sequence-specific activator proteins (activators) to their promoter-binding sites1. for example, the dna-binding domain of the yeast gal4 protein interacts very poorly with nucleosome cores compared with naked dna2 (and see below), and binding of other activators is even more strongly inhibited2,3. the way in which activators bind to nucleosomal dna is therefore a critical aspect of transcriptional activation. genetic studies have suggested that the multi-component swi/snf complex of saccharomyces cerevisiae facilitates transcription by altering the structure of the chromatin4,5. here we identify and partially purify a human homologue of the yeast swi/snf complex (hswi/snf complex). we show that a partially purified hswi/snf complex mediates the atp-dependent disruption of a nucleosome, thereby enabling the activators, gal4–vp16 and gal4–ah, to bind within a nucleosome core. we conclude that the hswi/snf complex acts directly to reorganize chromatin structure so as to facilitate binding of transcription factors.
the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium atpase 1 (serca1) has two muscle specific splice isoforms; serca1a in fast-type adult and serca1b in neonatal and regenerating skeletal muscles. at the protein level the only difference between these two isoforms is that serca1a has c-terminal glycine while serca1b has an octapeptide tail instead. this makes the generation of a serca1a specific antibody not feasible. the switch between the two isoforms is a hallmark of differentiation so we describe here a method based on the signal ratios of the serca1b specific and pan serca1 antibodies to estimate the serca1b/serca1a dominance on immunoblot of human muscles. using this method we showed that unlike in mouse and rat, serca1b was only expressed in pre-matured infant leg and arm muscles; it was replaced by serca1a in more matured neonatal muscles and was completely absent in human foetal and neonatal diaphragms. interestingly, only serca1a and no serca1b were detected in muscles of 7–12 years old boys with duchenne, a degenerative-regenerative muscular dystrophy. however, in adult patients with myotonic dystrophy type 2 (dm2), the serca1b dominated over serca1a. thus the human serca1b has a different expression pattern from that of rodents and it is associated with dm2.  the relative mrna levels corresponding to the different sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic-reticulum ca(2+)-atpase isoforms (serca1a, serca1b, serca2a, serca2b and serca3) were measured by reverse transcriptase-pcr in rat soleus muscles regenerating after notexin-induced necrosis. the succession of appearance of the different types of serca mrna species in regenerating muscle largely recapitulates those observed during normal ontogenesis. the mrna levels of the muscle-specific isoforms serca1a and serca2a became very low on the first and third days after injection of the snake venom. it was only on the fifth day of regeneration that the mrna of the neonatal variant of the fast-twitch skeletal serca1b isoform began to rise, well before the other serca transcripts. at 7 and 10 days, i.e. at a time when the new myofibres normally become reinnervated, the mrna level of serca1a and serca2a increased markedly, but the fast-twitch skeletal serca1a isoform was still the most prominent. on day 21, in the advanced stage of regeneration, a switch in the relative expression levels of serca1a and serca2a mrna was observed and the ratio of both isoforms became similar to that found in the normal soleus muscles. this was followed by a decline in the level of all serca mrna species, so that on day 28 the levels of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmatic-reticulum ca(2+)-pump rnas was again lower but their ratio remained similar to that of the untreated control soleus.
enterobacter sakazakii previously known as ‘yellow-pigmented e. cloacae’ has been classified as a new genus ‘cronobacter’ based on taxonomic analysis and geno-and phenotypic evaluation. this pathogenic organism has been associated with rare form of infant meningitis and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) with high mortality rate (40-80%). some cases have been linked to the consumption of contaminated powdered infant formula milk (pif). the objective of this study was to determine the presence of cronobacter spp. in pif sold in malaysia. a selective chromogenic agar, brilliance enterobacter sakazakii (dfi, oxoid), was used for detection of cronobacter strains. presumptive cronobacter isolates were identified using biochemical tests (api 20e and microgen tm ) and molecular assays (sybr green real-time pcr and 16s ribosomal dna sequencing). all presumptive cronobacter strains produced typical blue-green colonies and non-cronobacter strains produced yellow colonies on brilliance enterobacter sakazakii agar (dfi formulation). a total of 12 presumptive isolates were selected from dfi agar and identified with biochemical and molecular tests. the results indicated prevalence of 12.5% c. sakazakii contamination from 72 pif samples. molecular detection methods such as real-time pcr and 16s rdna proved to have higher identification percentage compared to the biochemical tests. in this study, it was observed that molecular assays were suitable means for sensitive identification of cronobacter strains in pif samples.  enterobacter sakazakii is an emerging pathogen associated with life-threatening neonatal infections resulting from the consumption of contaminated powdered infant formula milk (ifm). recent taxonomic analyses have determined that e. sakazakii comprises a number of genomospecies, and it has been proposed that e. sakazakii be reclassified as a novel genus, "cronobacter". accurate methods are required for the rapid detection and identification of this group of micro-organisms, since even low cell numbers have been reported to cause disease. the aim of this study was to evaluate various e. sakazakii detection methods in order to ascertain the most suitable method for detection and identification of these pathogenic agents. samples from ifm and the environment were evaluated for the presence of e. sakazakii using the isolation steps (pre-enrichment, enrichment and selection) described in the food and drug administration (fda) method for e. sakazakii detection. sixty-four isolates (50 from ifm and 14 from the environment) were selected from tryptone soy agar (tsa), regardless of colony appearance, and these isolates were identified by 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequencing. thereafter, different culture-dependent and culture-independent methods were evaluated to accurately detect and identify the e. sakazakii isolates. these methods included the assessment of yellow pigment production on tsa, typical colonies on chromogenic druggan-forsythe-iversen (dfi) and chromocult enterobacter sakazakii (ces) media and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using six different species-specific primer pairs described in the literature. identification of e. sakazakii using yellow pigment production was demonstrated to have a low sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (87%, 71% and 74%, respectively), which lowers the suitability of the fda method. chromogenic dfi and ces media were sensitive, specific and accurate (100%, 98% and 98%, respectively) for the detection of e. sakazakii. the specificity of the pcr amplifications ranged from 8% to 92%, emphasising the need for rigorous primer testing against closely related species. of the primer pairs evaluated, esakf/esakr were the most suitable for e. sakazakii detection and identification. the detection limit of esakf/esakr was found to be 10(4) cfu/ml. this study demonstrated that no single method was capable of unambiguously confirming the presence and identity of e. sakazakii isolates, that each method had inherent advantages and disadvantages, and that in most cases several methods were required for accurate detection and identification. further, it was demonstrated that the current fda method for e. sakazakii detection should be revised in the light of the availability of more sensitive, specific and accurate detection methods.
ten pregnant female camels divided into two groups received, after a 2-week adaptation period, an oral selenium (se) supplementation (0 and 2 mg, respectively) under sodium selenite form for 6 months from the three last months of gestation up to the three first months of lactation. feed intake was assessed daily. blood samples and body weight were taken on a biweekly basis, both in dams and their camel calves after parturition. feces and urine samples were collected monthly and milk on a biweekly basis. the se concentration in serum increased significantly in the supplemented group and was threefold higher than the concentration compared to the control group, respectively, 305.9 ± 103.3 and 109.3 ± 33.1 ng/ml. the selenium concentration increased in similar proportion in milk (86.4 ± 39.1 ng/ml in the control group vs 167.1 ± 97.3 ng/ml in treated group), in urine, and feces. the gluthathione peroxidase (gsh-px) activity varied between 18.1 ± 8.7 iu/g hemoglobin (hb) in control group and 47.5 ± 25.6 iu/g hb in treated group but decreased after parturition in both groups. vitamin e did not change significantly and was, on average, 1.17 ± 0.72 and 1.14 ± 0.89 ng/ml in the control and treated groups, respectively. significant correlations were reported between serum se, milk se, gsh-px, and fecal and urinary excretion or concentration. blood values in camel calves were similar to those of the dams. the results seemed to confirm the sensitivity of camel to se supplementation with an important increase of selenium in serum and milk.  selenium (se) is an essential micronutrient for the prevention of a number of deficiency syndromes in a variety of species (underwood, 1981). the occurrence of se deficiency in the dromedary camel was reported by zhang et al. (1986). in morocco, se deficiency is a widespread problem in the major grazing areas (hamliri, 1989) and one of the authors (a.h.) has diagnosed cases of se deficiency in a group of young dromedary camels consuming a diet containing 0.02 p.p.m. se on a dry matter basis. the seleno-enzyme glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px) is widely used as an indicator of se status because it is regularly correlated with blood se concentration (ganther et az., 1976). however, to the authors’ knowledge this correlation has not been previously studied in the dromedary camel.
purpose          the purpose of this paper is to investigate how buying firms facing low supply chain visibility can utilize their stakeholder network to identify salient supply chain sustainability risks (scsr).          design/methodology/approach          the study employs a design science approach to develop a procedural model for identifying scsr as a new artifact. a small-scale field-testing study in a food supply chain of a swiss retail firm demonstrates its applicability and pragmatic validity.          findings          when stakeholder knowledge external to the supply chain is regarded as a valuable resource, a generic understanding of a buying firm’s supply chain suffices to identify scsr hotspots without creating complexity for the scsr management.          research limitations/implications          the paper contributes to the study of scsr by identifying mechanisms buying firms can employ to identify scsr hotspots and fostering the nascent understanding of responsibility attribution by stakeholders. moreover, the emerging theory of the supply chain is enriched by paving a way to extend the supply chain visibility boundary. the procedural model is presumably most useful in contexts of elevated stakeholder pressure and low supply chain visibility. future research should seek to validate and improve the effectiveness of the newly designed artifact.          practical implications          the procedural model is directly applicable in corporate practice to the identification of scsr. moreover, its application fosters the understanding of a firm’s supply chain and its stakeholder network.          originality/value          scsr is an increasingly important phenomenon in corporate practice that has received only scarce research attention. the design science approach represents a valuable means for generating theoretical insights and emergent solutions to the real-world problem of scsr identification.  despite ambitious efforts in various fields of research over multiple decades, the goal of making academic research relevant to the practitioner remains elusive: theoretical and academic research interests do not seem to coincide with the interests of managerial practice. this challenge is more fundamental than knowledge transfer, it is one of diverging knowledge interests and means of knowledge production. in this paper, we look at this fundamental challenge through the lens of design science, which is an approach aimed primarily at discovery and problem-solving as opposed to accumulation of theoretical knowledge. we explore in particular the ways in which problem-solving research and theory-oriented academic research can complement one another. in operations management (om) research, recognizing and building on this complementarity is especially crucial, because problem-solving-oriented research produces the very artifacts (e.g., technologies) that empirical om research subsequently evaluates in an attempt to build explanatory theory. it is indeed the practitioner - not the academic scientist - who engages in basic research in om. this idiosyncrasy prompts the question: how can we enhance the cross-fertilization between academic research and research practice to make novel theoretical insights and practical relevance complementary? this article proposes a design science approach to bridge practice to theory, not vice versa, theory to practice.
the mass transfer of the guest molecules in nanoporous host materials, in particular in metal-organic frameworks (mofs), is among the crucial features of their applications. by using thin surface-mounted mof films in combination with a quartz crystal microbalance (qcm), the diffusion of ferrocene vapor and of ethanolic and hexanic ferrocene solution in hkust-1 was investigated. for the first time, liquid- and gas-phase diffusion in mofs was compared directly in the identical sample. the diffusion coefficients are in the same order of magnitude (~10−16 m2·s−1), whereas the diffusion coefficient of ferrocene in the empty framework is roughly 3-times smaller than in the mof which is filled with ethanol or n-hexane.  metal-organic frameworks (mofs) are highly porous materials generally consisting of two building elements: inorganic coupling units and organic linkers. these frameworks offer an enormous porosity, which can be used to store large amounts of gases and, as demonstrated in more recent applications, makes these compounds suitable for drug release. the huge sizes of the pores inside mofs, however, also give rise to a fundamental complication, namely the formation of sublattices occupying the same space. this interpenetration greatly reduces the pore size and thus the available space within the mof structure. we demonstrate here that the formation of the second, interpenetrated framework can be suppressed by using liquid-phase epitaxy on an organic template. this success demonstrates the potential of the step-by-step method to synthesize new classes of mofs not accessible by conventional solvothermal methods.
abstract breast asymmetry is common in females, despite a similar driving force; dynamic activity may result in asymmetrical breast motion. this preliminary study investigated how breast categorisation (left/right or dominant/non-dominant) may affect breast support recommendations and its relationship with breast pain. ten females ran on a treadmill at 10 kph in three breast supports (no bra, everyday bra, sports bra). five reflective markers on the thorax and nipples were tracked using infrared cameras (200 hz) during five running gait cycles in each breast support. multiplanar displacements of both breasts were calculated relative to the thorax. although the maximum individual participant difference was 2.4 cm (mediolaterally) between the left and right breast, no left/right differences were found in any direction or support condition. notably, correlations between breast pain and anterioposterior breast displacement were stronger with the left breast (r = 0.614) and moderate with the right breast (r = 0.456). following participant categorisation according to the greatest magnitude of superioinferior breast displacement (dominant breast), results showed significant differences in displacement for all directions across different breast supports. when using breast kinematic data to examine relationships with breast pain or to recommend breast support requirements, data on both breasts should be collected.  abstract although breast pain has been related to vertical breast displacement and velocity, the influence of breast support on multi-planar breast kinematics and breast comfort has yet to be ascertained. the aims of this study were to investigate multi-planar breast displacement, velocity, and acceleration with and without breast support during running and to establish the correlation with breast comfort. fifteen females ran at 2.8 m · s−1 in no bra, an everyday bra, and a sports bra. three-dimensional coordinates of breast and body markers were tracked during ten gait cycles and following each trial the participants rated their breast comfort. relative breast displacement was calculated and derived for velocity and acceleration. vertical breast displacement, velocity, and acceleration peaked at, before, and after mid-stance, respectively. the patterns of displacement and velocity trajectories were unaffected by increasing breast support, though the magnitudes were significantly reduced. the magnitude and trajectory of breast acceleration was unaffected by increasing breast support and showed no correlation with comfort. breast velocity displayed the strongest relationship to comfort (r = 0.61). considerable mediolateral and anteroposterior breast kinematics were identified, suggesting that future studies and bra design may benefit from three-dimensional analysis. in conclusion, improvements in breast support may be defined by reductions in breast velocity and displacement.
extensive experimental studies on the structure and density of silicate glasses as laboratory analogs of natural silicate melts have attempted to address the nature of dense silicate melts that may be present at the base of the mantle. previous ultrahigh-pressure experiments, however, have been performed on simple systems such as sio2 or mgsio3, and experiments in more complex system have been conducted under relatively low-pressure conditions below 60 gpa. the effect of other metal cations on structural changes that occur in dense silicate glasses under ultrahigh pressures has been poorly understood. here, we used a brillouin scattering spectroscopic method up to pressures of 196.9 gpa to conduct in situ high-pressure acoustic wave velocity measurements of sio2-al2o3 glasses in order to understand the effect of al2o3 on pressure-induced structural changes in the glasses as analogs of aluminosilicate melts. from 10 to 40 gpa, the transverse acoustic wave velocity (vs) of al2o3-rich glass (sio2 + 20.5 mol% al2o3) was greater than that of al2o3-poor glass (sio2 + 3.9 mol% al2o3). this result suggests that sio2-al2o3 glasses with higher proportions of al ions with large oxygen coordination numbers (5 and 6) become elastically stiffer up to 40 gpa, depending on the al2o3 content, but then soften above 40 gpa. at pressures from 40 to ~100 gpa, the increase in vs with increasing pressure became less steep than below 40 gpa. above ~100 gpa, there were abrupt increases in the p-vs gradients (dvs/dp) at 130 gpa in al2o3-poor glass and at 116 gpa in al2o3-rich glass. these changes resemble previous experimental results on sio2 glass and mgsio3 glass. given that changes of dvs/dp have commonly been related to changes in the si-o coordination states in the glasses, our results, therefore, may indicate a drastic structural transformation in sio2-al2o3 glasses above 116 gpa, possibly associated with an average si-o coordination number change to higher than 6. compared to previous acoustic wave velocity data on sio2 and mgsio3 glasses, al2o3 appears to promote a lowering of the pressure at which the abrupt increase of dvs/dp is observed. this suggests that the al2o3 in silicate melts may help to stabilize those melts gravitationally in the lower mantle.  acoustic wave velocities of sio2 glass were measured up to pressures of 207 gpa using newly developed brillouin scattering spectroscopic techniques to address the nature of pressure-induced structural changes. the acoustic wave velocity data suggests three distinct pressure regimes, two of which correspond to changes in the si-o coordination number with pressure, and one of which indicates the stability of sixfold-coordinated si over a broad pressure interval from approximately 40-140 gpa. an anomalous increase in the effect of pressure on velocity at 140 gpa most likely corresponds to the onset of structural densification associated with an increase in coordination number from sixfold to a higher coordination state.
backgroundwe conducted a survey to determine whether hernia surgeons follow evidence-based medicine (ebm) criteria in their daily routine.methodsall chiefs of general surgery in styria (austria) received a short, simple, two-page, 10-item questionnaire.resultswe analyzed completed surveys from 15 departments reporting 2441 hernia repairs with a mean patient age of 57.5 ± 11.6 years. although five techniques accounted for 96.6% of procedures, the frequency of use of each technique varied considerably among the hospitals. there were high numbers of laparoscopic (36.8%) and sutured (19.9%) repairs.conclusionsbecause of the great variance among the evaluated hospitals as to surgical methods and indications, this survey showed that inguinal hernia surgery does not currently comply with ebm.  introductionchronic pain after hernia repair is common, and it is unclear to what extent the different operation techniques influence its incidence. the aim of the present study was to compare the three major standardized techniques of hernia repair with regard to postoperative pain.patients and methodstwo hundred and eighty male patients with primary hernias were prospectively, randomly selected to undergo shouldice, tension-free lichtenstein or laparoscopic transabdominal pre-peritoneal (tapp) hernioplasty repairs. patients were examined after 52 months with emphasis on chronic pain and its limitations to their quality of life.resultschronic pain was present in 36% of patients after shouldice repair, in 31% after lichtenstein repair and in 15% after tapp repair. pain correlated with physical strain in 25% of patients after shouldice, in 20% after lichtenstein and in 11% after tapp repair. limitations to daily life, leisure activities and sports occurred in 14% of patients after shouldice, 13% after lichtenstein and 2.4% after tapp repair.conclusionchronic pain after hernia surgery is significantly more common with the open approach to the groin by shouldice and lichtenstein methods. the presence of the prosthetic mesh was not associated with significant postoperative complaints. the tapp repair represents the most effective approach of the three techniques in the hands of an experienced surgeon.
in open source software (oss) communities, volunteers collaborate and integrate expertise to develop the software online via the internet in a decentralized, highly interactive and knowledge-intensive process. development of qualified and secured software products relies mainly on the ability of oss participants to acquire, refine and use new aspects of secure programming knowledge. many oss proponents believe that the open source innovation offers significant learning opportunities from its best practices. however, studies that specifically explore learning of software security in the context of open source development are scarce. this paper aims to empirically assess present knowledge sharing and learning about secure programming knowledge in the context of oss communities utilized a socio-technical approach on oss projects based on an ethnographic observation. our motivation is not only to evaluate the knowledge sharing and learning mechanisms and the extent to which they may be viable and successful but also to gain insight into the security culture and project factors that affect learning processes of secure programming in oss communities.  ethnography is a qualitative research method used to study people and cultures. it is largely adopted in disciplines outside software engineering, including different areas of computer science. ethnography can provide an in-depth understanding of the socio-technological realities surrounding everyday software development practice, i.e., it can help to uncover not only what practitioners do, but also why they do it. despite its potential, ethnography has not been widely adopted by empirical software engineering researchers, and receives little attention in the related literature. the main goal of this paper is to explain how empirical software engineering researchers would benefit from adopting ethnography. this is achieved by explicating four roles that ethnography can play in furthering the goals of empirical software engineering: to strengthen investigations into the social and human aspects of software engineering; to inform the design of software engineering tools; to improve method and process development; and to inform research programmes. this article introduces ethnography, explains its origin, context, strengths and weaknesses, and presents a set of dimensions that position ethnography as a useful and usable approach to empirical software engineering research. throughout the paper, relevant examples of ethnographic studies of software practice are used to illustrate the points being made.
salt tolerance is an important economic trait for crops growing in both irrigated fields and marginal lands. the plant kingdom contains plant species that possess highly distinctive capacities for salt tolerance as a result of evolutionary adaptation to their environments. yet, the cellular mechanisms contributing to salt tolerance seem to be conserved to some extent in plants although some highly salt-tolerant plants have unique structures that can actively excrete salts. in this review, we begin by summarizing the research in arabidopsis with a focus on the findings of three membrane transporters that are important for salt tolerance: sos1, athkt1, and atnhx1. we then review the recent studies in salt tolerance in crops and halophytes. molecular and physiological mechanisms of salt tolerance in plants revealed by the studies in the model plant, crops, and halophytes are emphasized. utilization of the na+ transporters to improve salt tolerance in plants is also summarized. perspectives are provided at the end of this review.  transgenic plants overexpressing the vacuolar h+-pyrophosphatase are much more resistant to high concentrations of nacl and to water deprivation than the isogenic wild-type strains. these transgenic plants accumulate more na+ and k+ in their leaf tissue than the wild type. moreover, direct measurements on isolated vacuolar membrane vesicles derived from the avp1 transgenic plants and from wild type demonstrate that the vesicles from the transgenic plants have enhanced cation uptake. the phenotypes of the avp1 transgenic plants suggest that increasing the vacuolar proton gradient results in increased solute accumulation and water retention. presumably, sequestration of cations in the vacuole reduces their toxic effects. genetically engineered drought- and salt-tolerant plants could provide an avenue to the reclamation of farmlands lost to agriculture because of salinity and a lack of rainfall.
mobile ad hoc networks (manets) are self-organized and fully distributed networks that rely on the collaboration of participating devices to route data from source to destination. the manet paradigm is expected to enable ubiquitous mobile communication and thus the proliferation of pervasive applications. the manet working group (wg) of the internet engineering task force (ietf) is responsible for standardizing an appropriate internet protocol (ip) based routing protocol functionality for both static (mesh) and dynamic (mobile) wireless ad hoc network topologies. in this paper, we provide a background on the possibility to use manets for enabling future pervasive internet and innovative ubiquitous services. we also describe the work achieved by the manet wg thus far on the area of secure unicast and multicast routing for manets. we also examine non-ietf work on this area, chiefly based on adaptive and hybrid routing. the paper then presents comparative performance evaluations of discussed routing protocols. it is mainly observed that there is a need for adaptive hybrid routing approaches in order to support future innovative and pervasive applications. consequently, we present our conclusions.  this memo first describes the characteristics of mobile ad hoc networks (manets), and their idiosyncrasies with respect to traditional, hardwired packet networks. it then discusses the effect these differences have on the design and evaluation of network control protocols with an emphasis on routing performance evaluation considerations.
abstractongoing monitoring in the swiss alps has shown that rock ptarmigan (lagopus muta helvetica) has suffered a significant population decrease over the last decade and climate change has been proposed as a potential cause. in this study, we investigate the response of this high alpine grouse species to rapid climate change. we address a problem often neglected in macro-ecological studies on species distribution: scale-dependency of distribution models. the models are based on empirical field data and on environmental databases for large-scale models. the implementation of several statistical modelling approaches, external validation strategies and the implementation of a recent study on regional climate change in switzerland ensure robust predictions of future range shifts. our results demonstrate that, on the territory level, variables depicting vegetation, heterogeneity of local topography and habitat structure have greatest explanatory power. in contrast at the meso-scale and macro-scale (with grain sizes of 1 and 100 km2, respectively), bioclimatic and land cover-related variables play a prominent role. the models predict that, based on increasing temperatures during the breeding season, potential habitat will decrease by up to two-thirds until the year 2070. at the same time, a shift of potential habitat towards the mountain tops is predicted. the multi-scale approach highlights the true extent of potential habitat for this species with its patchy distribution in steep terrain. the small-scale analysis pinpoints the key habitat areas within the extensive areas of suitable habitat predicted by models on large grain sizes and in this way reveals sub-grid variability. our results can facilitate the adaptation of species conservation strategies to a quickly changing environment.zusammenfassunghabitat auf den gipfeln der berge: wie lange kann das alpenschneehuhn (lagopus muta helvetica) raschen klimawandel in den schweizer alpen überleben? ein mehrskaliger ansatz.  fortlaufendes monitoring hat gezeigt, dass innerhalb des letzten jahrzehnts die population des alpenschneehuhns (lagopus muta helvetica) in den schweizer alpen stark abgenommen hat. als mögliche ursache kommt der klimawandel in betracht. in dieser studie untersuchen wir die auswirkungen raschen klimawandels auf dieses hochalpine raufußhuhn. dabei setzten wir uns mit einem aspekt auseinander, der in vielen makroökologischen studien oft vernachlässigt wird: die skalenabhängigkeit von habitatmodellen. die modelle basieren auf empirischen felddaten und auf umweltdatenbanken für die großskaligen modelle. die anwendung mehrerer, statistischer modelle, externe validierung und die daten einer aktuellen studie zum klimawandel in der schweiz legen die grundlage für robuste vorhersagen der künftigen verbreitung des alpenschneehuhns. unsere ergebnisse zeigen, dass auf der revierskala variablen, die die vegetation, die lokale topographie und habitatstruktur beschreiben die größte vorhersagekraft haben. im gegensatz dazu spielen auf der mesoskala (korngröße 1 km2) und makroskala (korngröße 100 km2) bioklimatische und land cover variablen die herausragende rolle. die modelle sagen vorher, dass sich allein aufgrund einer erhöhten durchschnittstemperatur während der brutzeit das potenzielle habitat bis zum jahre 2070 um bis zu zwei drittel verringern wird. zudem findet eine verschiebung in richtung gebirgsgipfel statt. insbesondere für arten, die steiles terrain bewohnen und lückenhafte verbreitung aufweisen wie das alpenschneehuhn, verdeutlicht die analyse auf mehreren skalen das wirkliche ausmaß des potenziellen habitats. so zeigt die feinskalige analyse die bevorzugten gebiete innerhalb der großräumigen gebiete auf, welche die modelle auf den großen skalen vorhersagen und verdeutlicht auf diese weise die variabilität innerhalb der rasterzellen. unsere ergebnisse können einen beitrag zur anpassung der naturschutzstrategien zur arterhaltung in einer sich schnell verändernden umwelt leisten.  with the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and gis tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. a wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. in this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. the variety of statistical techniques used is growing. ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (glm) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. gam), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. the selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species’ response (or realized niche). conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. in the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. new methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (roc)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. the choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. this may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. in turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. © 2000 elsevier science b.v. all rights reserved.
repeated maternal separation of pups from dams is often used as an early life stressor that causes profound neurochemical and behavioral changes in the pups that persist into adulthood. the effects of maternal separation on both the dams and the treated pups as adults on cocaine self-administration were examined using four separation conditions: 15- or 180-min separation (ms15 and ms180), brief handling without separation (ms0), and a nonhandled group (nh). the separations and handling occurred daily on postnatal days 2 to 15. the acquisition of cocaine self-administration (0.0625–1.0 mg/kg/infusion) was evaluated in the treated pups as adults. the ms180 group acquired cocaine self-administration at the lowest dose tested (0.0625 mg/kg/infusion), whereas the ms15s did not respond for cocaine at rates greater than that seen with saline administration. the nh group received the greatest number of infusions and intake at the highest doses. after self-administration, no differences were observed between groups in activity of two liver carboxylesterases involved in the inactivation of cocaine, es10 and es4. maternal separation affected cocaine self-administration in the dams as well. although there was an overall significant affect of treatment on cocaine self-administration, the length of separation (15 or 180 min) did not affect cocaine self-administration on the dams. the ms0 dams averaged a greater number of infusions per session than nh group during the 1st week of acquisition. these data suggest that in addition to the profound changes that occur in pups as result of maternal separation, the dams are also susceptible to alterations in behaviors.  the effect of corticosterone on the acquisition of cocaine-seeking behavior was investigated in rats using ascending dose-response curves for intravenous cocaine self-administration. rats pretreated daily with corticosterone (2.0 mg/kg i.p.) acquired cocaine self-administration at a lower dose compared with vehicle-treated controls. in contrast, daily corticosterone pretreatment did not alter food-maintained responding. cocaine self-administration was not affected by the type i (mineralocorticoid) receptor agonist, aldosterone (100 microgram/kg). however, rats treated with the type ii (glucocorticoid) receptor agonist, dexamethasone (10 or 100 microgram/kg) did not acquire self-administration at any dose tested. the 100 microgram/kg dose of dexamethasone attenuated food-reinforced behavior and decreased body weight, but these effects were not observed with the 10 microgram/kg dose. dexamethasone dose-dependently attenuated the plasma corticosterone response to self-administered infusions or intraperitoneal injections of cocaine, indicating that the ability of dexamethasone to block cocaine-induced corticosterone secretion may have contributed to its effects on self-administration. administration of aldosterone (100 microgram/kg) together with 10 microgram/kg dexamethasone restored self-administration to the level of vehicle-treated rats, suggesting that type i receptor occupation by corticosterone may be required for the acquisition of this behavior. these results indicate that stress-induced corticosterone secretion may provide a substrate through which stressors interact with cocaine reinforcement. additionally, the finding that dexamethasone blocks the acquisition of cocaine self-administration may be relevant to the development of novel approaches to the treatment of cocaine addiction.
isovaleric acidemia (iva, mim 248600) can be a severe and potentially life-threatening disease in affected neonates, but with a positive prognosis on treatment for some phenotypes. this study presents the first application of metabolomics to evaluate the metabolite profiles derived from urine samples of untreated and treated iva patients as well as of obligate heterozygotes. all iva patients carried the same homozygous c.367 g > a nucleotide change in exon 4 of the ivd gene but manifested phenotypic diversity. concurrent class analysis (conca) was used to compare all the metabolites from the original complete data set obtained from the three case and two control groups used in this investigation. this application of conca has not been reported previously, and is used here to compare four different modes of scaling of all metabolites. the variables important in discrimination from the conca thus enabled the recognition of different metabolic patterns encapsulated within the data sets that would not have been revealed by using only one mode of scaling. application of multivariate and univariate analyses disclosed 11 important metabolites that distinguished untreated iva from controls. these included well-established diagnostic biomarkers of iva, endogenous detoxification markers, and 3-hydroxycaproic acid, an indicator of ketosis, but not reported previously for this disease. nine metabolites were identified that reflected the effect of treatment of iva. they included detoxification products and indicators related to the high carbohydrate and low protein diet which formed the hallmark of the treatment. this investigation also provides the first comparative metabolite profile for heterozygotes of this inherited metabolic disorder. the detection of informative metabolites in even very low concentrations in all three experimental groups highlights the potential advantage of the holistic mode of analysis of inherited metabolic diseases in a metabolomics investigation.  isovaleric acidemia (iva) is one of the most common organic acidemias found in south africa. since 1983, a significant number of iva cases have been identified in approximately 20,000 caucasian patients screened for metabolic defects. iva is caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of isovaleryl-coa dehydrogenase (ivd) resulting in the accumulation of isovaleryl-coa and its metabolites. in total, 10 iva patients and three carriers were available for phenotypic and genotypic investigation in this study. all patients were found to be homozygous for a single c.367 g > a (p.g123r) mutation. the amino acid substitution of a glycine to arginine resulted in a markedly reduced steady-state level of the ivd protein, which explains the nearly complete lack of ivd enzyme activity as assessed in fibroblast homogenates. despite the genetic homogeneity of this south african iva group, the clinical presentation varied widely, ranging from severe mental handicap and multiple episodes of metabolic derangement to an asymptomatic state. the variation may be due to poor dietary intervention, delayed diagnosis or even epigenetic and polygenetic factors of unknown origin.
mangrove forests are highly productive ecosystems but represent low nutrient environments. nitrogen availability is one of the main factors limiting mangrove growth. diazotrophs have been identified as key organisms that provide nitrogen to these environments. n2-fixation by such organisms was found to be higher in the mangrove roots than in surrounding rhizosphere. moreover, previous studies showed that mangroves grew better in the presence of n2-fixers indicating a potentially mutualistic relationship. however, the molecular signals and mechanisms that govern these interactions are still poorly understood. here we present novel insights in the interaction of a diazotroph with a mangrove species to improve our understanding of the molecular and ecophysiological relationship between these two organisms under controlled conditions. our results showed that marinobacterium mangrovicola is a versatile organism capable of competing with other organisms to survive for long periods in mangrove soils. n2-fixation by this bacterium was up-regulated in the presence of mangrove roots, indicating a possible beneficial interaction. the increase in n2-fixation was limited to cells of the exponential growth phase suggesting that n2-fixation differs over the bacterial growth cycle. bacterial transformants harboring a transcriptional nifh::gusa fusion showed that m. mangrovicola successfully colonized mangrove roots and simultaneously conducted n2-fixation. the colonization process was stimulated by the lack of an external carbon source suggesting a possible mutualistic relationship. m. mangrovicola represents an interesting genetically accessible diazotroph, which colonize mangrove roots and exhibit higher n2-fixation in the presence of mangrove roots. consequently, we propose this microorganism as a tool to study molecular interactions between n2-fixers and mangrove plants and to better understand how changes in the environment could impact these important and relatively unknown interactions.  trichodesmium spp. have proved to be enigmatic organisms, and their ecology and physiology are unusual among diazotrophs. recent research shows that they can simultaneously fix n2 and take up combined nitrogen. the co-occurrence of these two processes is thought to be incompatible, but they could be obligatory in trichodesmium spp. if only a small fraction of cells within a colony or along a filament are capable of n2 fixation. combined nitrogen is released from cells during periods of active growth and n2 fixation, and concomitantly taken up by trichodesmium spp. or cells living in association with colonies. although the nitrogenase of trichodesmium spp. is affected by high concentrations of combined nitrogen, it might be relatively less sensitive to low concentrations of combined nitrogen typical of the oligotrophic ocean and culture conditions. nitrogenase activity and synthesis exhibits an endogenous rhythm in trichodesmium spp. cultures, which is affected by the addition of nitrogen.
we report on the first studies on the characterization of venom from phoneutria boliviensis (aranae:ctenidae) (f. o. pickard-cambridge, 1897), done with colombian species. after the electrostimulation extraction process, the venom showed physicochemical properties corresponding to a colorless and water-soluble liquid with a density of 0.86 mg/ml and 87% aqueous content. p. boliviensis venom and rp-hplc fractions showed hemolytic activity and hydrolyzed the synthetic substrate 4-nitro-3-octanoyloxy-benzoic acid, indicating the presence of phospholipases a2 enzymes. the electrophoretic profile showed an important protein content with molecular masses below 14 kda, and differences between male and female protein content were also revealed. the rp-hplc venom profile exposes differences between males and female content consistent with the electrophoretic profile. five fractions collected from the rp-hplc displayed significant larvicidal activity. mass analysis indicates the presence of peptides ranging from 1047.71 to 3278.07 da. two peptides, ctenitoxin-pb48 and ctenitoxin-pb53, were partially identified using hplc-nesi-ms/ms, which showed a high homology with other ctenitoxins (family tx3) from phoneutria nigriventer, phoneutria keyserlingi and phoneutria reidyi affecting voltage-gated calcium receptors (cav 1, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3) and nmda-glutamate receptors.  several pools of neurotoxic peptides obtained from fractionated phoneutria nigriventer venom induce different toxicological effects. one of them, phtx4, is highly toxic towards insects and displays only a slight toxicity when injected in mice. also, this fraction contains a class of peptides that are able to inhibit glutamate uptake in preparations of mammalian central nervous systems (cns). in this work a new toxin called pntx4-3 was isolated from the phtx4 fraction by reverse phase and anion exchange steps using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). edman sequencing of pntx4-3 revealed that it was a polypeptide of 48 amino acid residues, containing 10 cysteines cross-linked by five disulfide bridges. the molecular mass measured by es-q-tof mass spectrometry was 5199.49+/-0.64 da, which is very close to the calculated mass from amino acid sequence (5199.99 da). this toxin induces immediate excitatory effects when injected intrathoracically in house flies and cockroaches. intracerebroventricular injections of 30 microg of pntx4-3 in mice resulted in no apparent signs of intoxication. in order to make an orthologous comparison, pharmacological characterisation were carried out in rat brain synaptosomes by using [3h]-l-glutamate, showed that the whole phtx4 fraction as well as the pure toxins pntx4-3, tx4(6-1) and tx4(5-5) obtained of this fraction, were able to inhibit the glutamate uptake in the micromolar concentration range. pntx4-3 inhibits the glutamate uptake in a dose dependent manner, with an ic50 of approximately 1 microm. pntx4-3 is highly homologous to the tx4(6-1) and tx4(5-5) toxins previously described from the same fraction.
background the study was conducted to characterize the changes in bleeding pattern over time in women receiving the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (lng-ius) for heavy menstrual bleeding (hmb). the reduction in menstrual blood loss volume has been well documented elsewhere.   study design post hoc pooled analysis of the impact of the lng-ius on bleeding patterns in four comparator studies of medical and surgical treatment options for hmb. we enrolled women aged ≥18 years with hmb without organic pathology. the change in the number of bleeding and spotting (b/s) days and bleeding patterns was assessed over the duration of the studies pooled.   results one hundred and sixty-three women received the lng-ius in randomized trials. relative to pretreatment baseline, there was a transient increase in the mean number of bleeding days in the first month of treatment, which returned to baseline by the second month and declined thereafter. although the number of spotting days also increased during the first month of treatment, these declined with continued use but remained elevated relative to baseline during the first year of treatment.   conclusion in women with hmb, the lng-ius is associated with an initial increase in number of b/s days that improve over time.  a 20 micrograms/24 hours levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive device (lng-iud) has, in an open randomized multicenter study, been compared to the copper-releasing device nova t during 5 years of use; 1821 women had the lng-iud and 937 women had the nova t inserted. the 5-year cumulative gross pregnancy rate was 5.9% for nova t and 0.5% for the lng-iud. the local effect of levonorgestrel in the uterine cavity causes reduction of menstrual blood loss and development of oligo-amenorrhea, and the termination rates because of heavy and/or prolonged menstrual flow were significantly (p < 0.001) lower among lng-iud users. however, the gross termination rate because of amenorrhea was 6.0 in this group. hb increased during use of the lng-iud and decreased during nova t use, and the difference between the devices was statistically significant. the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) was low in lng-iud users regardless of age, whereas in the nova t group, the pid rate was increased among the youngest women, which makes the difference between the devices significant (p < 0.01). the gross termination rate for reasons considered to be hormonal was 12.1 in the lng-iud group compared to 2.0 in the nova t group (p < 0.001). the lng-iud is a long-acting reversible contraceptive method for 5 years with a pregnancy rate comparable to female sterilization. the incidence of pid is low even in young women. in addition, the positive health effects such as decreased menstrual blood loss and increased blood haemoglobin concentration make the lng-iud a favorable combination of hormonal and intrauterine contraception.
introduction: the pattern of sleep plays an important role in protecting the adolescents’ health. the main objective of this research is to determine the relationship between sufficient sleep (≥ 8 hours of sleep per night on school days) and health-risk behaviours in portuguese adolescents. methods: 5,050 participants with an average age of 13.98 (dp ± 1.85), 52.3% of which were female. the instrument used was the health behaviour in school-aged children 2010 (hbsc) questionnaire. the associations were studied by applying χ² tests and the multivariate logistic regression models. results: a significant percentage of adolescents (39%) get less than 8 hours sleep on weekdays. sufficient sleep (≥ 8 h) is associated with younger age: adolescents between the ages of 13 and 15 (or=0.549, p<.05) and those aged 16 or older (or=0.291, p<.05) sleep less, as well as with less consumption of tobacco (or=0.728, p<.05) and alcohol (or=0.837, p<.05), a lower level of sadness (or=0.786, p<.05) and a lower tendency to use the computer for 3 hours or more a day (or=0.829, p<.05). conclusion: the adolescents’ pattern of sleep is an important feature in adolescents lifestyles being associated to a large range of health and health compromising behaviours.  aim:  to investigate the sleep quality status and its associated factors (including psychological and physiological as well as social demographic factors) among chinese mainland adolescents.
