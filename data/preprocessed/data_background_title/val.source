identification of pathologically insignificant prostate cancer is not accurate in unscreened men purpose we assessed the relationship between the number of positive cores obtained at extended biopsy and tumor volume in radical prostatectomy specimens as a tool for predicting the biological significance of prostate cancer from biopsy data.   materials and methods the study group included 207 men who were treated with radical prostatectomy without neoadjuvant therapy at our cancer center. all patients were diagnosed by systematic extended biopsy (10 or 11 cores) performed between 1997 and 2003. the variables analyzed were patient age, prostate specific antigen, clinical stage, biopsy gleason score, maximum tumor length in a core, greatest percent of tumor in a core, total tumor length, total percent of tumor in all cores, positive core location, initial or repeat biopsy and prostate volume in subgroups based on the number of positive cores, that is group 1-1, group 2-2 and group 3-3 or more cores. bivariate correlation analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to determine the predictors of insignificant cancer.   results the number of positive cores was significantly related to total tumor volume (r = 0.433, p <0.001). insignificant prostate cancer (volume less than 0.5 cc and gleason score 6 or less) was found in 21.7% of patients (45 of 207). the incidence of insignificant cancer was 42.5% (31 of 73 patients) in group 1, 16.4% (10 of 61) in group 2 and 5.5% (4 of 73) in group 3. there was a significant difference in the incidence of insignificant cancer among the subgroups (group 1 vs 2 p <0.001, group 1 vs 3 p <0.0001 and group 2 vs 3 p <0.05). the best model for predicting insignificant cancer in group 1 was the combination of tumor length less than 2 mm, gleason score 3 + 4 or less and prostate volume greater than 50 cc with 83.9% sensitivity (26 of 31 patients) and 61.9% specificity (26 of 42).   conclusions the probability of insignificant cancer was directly related to the number of positive cores. tumor length in a core, gleason score and prostate volume significantly enhanced the prediction model for insignificant cancer in men with 1 positive core who underwent extended biopsy.
induction and inhibition of ciprofloxacin resistance-conferring mutations in hypermutator bacteria the incidence of emergent resistance and clinical factors affecting its development were evaluated by retrospective review of 173 studies encompassing over 14,000 patients. eight antibiotic classes and 225 individual treatment regimens were evaluated. emergent resistance occurred among 4.0% of all organisms and 5.6% of all infections treated. it appeared to be significantly more frequent with penicillin and aminoglycoside monotherapy, with significantly lower rates associated with imipenem‐cilastatin, aztreonam, and combination therapy. clinical failure also appeared to be significantly more likely to occur after emergence of resistance among organisms treated with fluoroquinolones or aminoglycosides. infections associated with higher resistance rates were cystic fibrosis, osteomyelitis, and lower respiratory tract infections. resistance was most common in patients in intensive care units or receiving mechanical ventilation. it was also significantly frequent among studies performed in university or teaching hospitals. organisms associated with high resistance rates were pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia, enterobacter, and acinetobacter sp. factors such as infection type, underlying diseases, type of institution, and specific pathogens warrant consideration when examining emergent resistance.
inflammatory cells, microglia and mhc class ii antigen-positive cells in the spinal cord of lewis rats with acute and chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in addition to the major population of infiltrating leukocytes recovered from inflamed rat central nervous system (cns), all of which expressed high levels of leukocyte common antigen cd45, many cells were coisolated that were mrc ox42+ (complement receptor 3/cd11b) but expressed low-to-moderate levels of cd45 and major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i molecules. most cells from normal cns, in contrast, lay within this latter, cd45low population. from previous in situ immunohistochemical studies, the fortuitously isolated cd45low cells were probably resident (ramified) microglia. using irradiation chimeras, we show that resident microglia respond to inflammation by upregulating cd45, cd4, and mhc class i molecules with a minority of these cells increasing their expression of mhc class ii molecules. a 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of microglia isolated from inflamed cns provided indirect evidence that the cells had proliferated. in normal cns, a very small population of blood-derived cd45high-expressing cells are present; most mhc class ii expression is associated with these few cells and not with the resident microglia.
astrocyte-like glia associated with the embryonic development of the central complex in the grasshopper schistocerca gregaria within the arthropoda, morphologies of neurons, the organization of neurons within neuropils and the occurrence of neuropils can be highly conserved and provide robust characters for phylogenetic analyses. the present paper reviews some features of insect and crustacean brains that speak against an entomostracan origin of the insects, contrary to received opinion. neural organization in brain centres, comprising olfactory pathways, optic lobes and a central neuropil that is thought to play a cardinal role in multi-joint movement, support affinities between insects and malacostracan crustaceans.
an analysis of the clinical and biologic significance of tp53 loss and the identification of potential novel transcriptional targets of tp53 in multiple myeloma. the ability to derive a whole-genome map of transcription-factor binding sites (tfbs) is crucial for elucidating gene regulatory networks. herein, we describe a robust approach that couples chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) with the paired-end ditag (pet) sequencing strategy for unbiased and precise global localization of tfbs. we have applied this strategy to map p53 targets in the human genome. from a saturated sampling of over half a million pet sequences, we characterized 65,572 unique p53 chip dna fragments and established overlapping pet clusters as a readout to define p53 binding loci with remarkable specificity. based on this information, we refined the consensus p53 binding motif, identified at least 542 binding loci with high confidence, discovered 98 previously unidentified p53 target genes that were implicated in novel aspects of p53 functions, and showed their clinical relevance to p53-dependent tumorigenesis in primary cancer samples.

matrix metalloproteinases expressed by astrocytes mediate extracellular amyloid-β peptide catabolism activated macrophages produce several matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), a family of extracellular matrix (ecm)‐degrading enzymes, during wound healing and in other inflammatory states. in response to brain injury, brain microglia become “activated,” in a way similar to peripheral tissue macrophages, a process which includes differentiation and probably invasion and proliferation. little is known about the ecm‐degrading mmps that are secreted by microglia upon activation. thus, it was of interest to determine whether activated microglia secrete mmps. conditioned media samples obtained from cultured microglia that were stimulated with various activating agents were subjected to gelatin‐substrate zymography. microglia constitutively express low levels of a 94‐kda gelatinase (glase) activity. treatment with lps, zymosan, and fixed staphylococcus aureus for 24 hr stimulated the activity of the 94‐kda glase, 4‐20‐fold, in a dose‐dependent manner. addition of infγ inhibited the lps‐stimulated activity of mmp‐9. lps, zymosan, and fixed staphylococcus aureus also stimulated the secretion of il‐6 from microglia in a dose‐dependent manner. the 94‐kda glase activity was ca++ dependent, it was inhibited by 1,10‐phenanthroline, and it was activated by organomercurial compounds. when immunoblots were performed using specific antisera against the 94‐kda gelatinase b (mmp‐9) with untreated and lps‐stimulated conditioned medium samples, a 94‐kda immunopositive band was observed. thus, it appears that the 94‐kda glase is gelatinase b (mmp‐9). these results indicate that activators of peripheral macrophages are potent secretagogues for the mmps in cultured microglia. the ability of activated microglia to secrete mmps suggests that these enzymes may play an important function in the brain parenchyma during inflammatory states. © 1995 wiley‐liss, inc.
geographic variations in retention in care among hiv-infected adults in the united states cohort studies based upon clinic populations and medical records are becoming more abundant due in part to an increasing trend toward electronic medical records and advancement in information technology. this design has been utilized in the hiv setting to great success and involves following individuals as they access medical care. these clinical cohort designs have not been compared to the classic interval cohort design in which individuals are followed at specified intervals that are unrelated to the participants' ongoing health care. the interval and clinical cohort designs are distinguished and the advantages and disadvantages inherent in each design are discussed.
exploring the diffeomorphism invariant hilbert space of a scalar field in loop quantum gravity, matter fields can have support only on the 'polymer-like' excitations of quantum geometry, and their algebras of observables and hilbert spaces of states cannot refer to a classical, background geometry. therefore, to adequately handle the matter sector, one has to address two issues already at the kinematic level. first, one has to construct the appropriate background-independent operator algebras and hilbert spaces. second, to make contact with low-energy physics, one has to relate this 'polymer description' of matter fields to the standard fock description in minkowski space. while this task has been completed for gauge fields, important gaps remained in the treatment of scalar fields. the purpose of this letter is to fill these gaps.
sex differences in the oxygen uptake kinetic response to heavy-intensity exercise in prepubertal children to determine the precise nonsteady-state characteristics of ventilation (ve), o2 uptake (vo2), and co2 output (vco2) during moderate-intensity exercise, six subjects each underwent eight repetitions of 100-w constant-load cycling. the tests were preceded either by rest or unloaded cycling ("0" w). an early component of ve, vo2, and vco2 responses, which was obscured on any single test by the breath-to-breath fluctuations, became apparent when the several repetitions were averaged. these early responses were abrupt when the work was instituted from rest but were much slower and smaller from the 0-w base line and corresponded to the phase of cardiodynamic gas exchange. some 20 s after the onset of the work a further monoexponential increase to steady state occurred in all three variables, the time constants of which did not differ between the two types of test. consequently, the exponential behavior of ve, vo2, and vco2 in response to moderate exercise is best described by a model that incorporates only the second phase of the response.
personality features, dissociation, self-stigma, hope, and the complex treatment of depressive disorder the purpose of this study was to determine whether cloninger's revised 7-factor model of personality showed incremental validity over his four dimensions of temperament. a sample of 2517 australian twins aged over 50 between 1993 and 1995 returned completed self-reported measures of self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence from cloninger's temperament and character inventory. many of these twins had participated in a 1988 study containing cloninger's temperament measures of harm avoidance, novelty seeking, reward dependence and persistence. contrary to theoretical expectations, univariate analyses revealed that familial aggregation for the character dimensions could be entirely explained by additive gene action alone. although temperament explained 26, 37 and 10% of additive genetic variance in self-directedness, cooperativeness and self-transcendence, respectively, seven genetic factors were required to explain the genetic variance among the tpq dimensions, and almost all of the non-shared environmental variance was unique to each dimension of character. our results indicate that the inclusion of all seven dimensions in a taxonomy of personality is warranted.
when are the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty large? many commentators argue that uncertainty about taxes, government spending and other policy matters deepened the recession of 2007-2009 and slowed the recovery. to investigate this issue we develop a new index of policy-related economic uncertainty and estimate its dynamic relationship to output, investment and employment. our index averages several components that reflect the frequency of news media references to economic policy uncertainty, the number of federal tax code provisions set to expire in future years, and the extent of forecaster disagreement over future inflation and federal government purchases. the index spikes near consequential presidential elections and after major events such as the gulf wars and the 9/11 attack. index values are very high in recent years with clear jumps around the lehman bankruptcy and tarp legislation, the 2010 midterm elections, the eurozone crisis and the u.s. debt-ceiling dispute. we also construct an index of european economic policy uncertainty mirroring our american news-based index. var estimates show that an increase in policy uncertainty equal to the actual change between 2006 and 2011 foreshadows large and persistent declines in aggregate outcomes, with peak declines of 3.2% in real gdp, 16% in private investment and 2.3 million in aggregate employment. jel no. d80, e22, e66, g18, l50
trait anxiety, state anxiety, and attentional bias to threat: assessing the psychometric properties of response time measures testing feasibility and efficacy of psychological treatment via mobile devices is important, given its potential benefits for high-dosage treatment delivery, widespread and inexpensive dissemination, and efficient research methods. we conducted the first randomized controlled trial of attention bias modification training delivered via smartphones, comparing this training to control training in a double-blind design, also including a waitlist condition. all participants performed a variant of dot-probe training involving faces with neutral and disgust (representative of social threat) expressions in brief sessions three times daily over 4 weeks on their own smartphones, at home or anywhere they chose. attention bias modification, also known as cognitive bias modification of attention, training included a contingency to induce attentional deployment away from disgust faces, whereas the control training included no contingency. participants completed weekly internet-based self-report symptom assessments as well as smartphone-delivered dot-probe attention bias assessments, whose reliability findings supported the viability of using smartphones for reaction-time based assessments. the between-groups training effect on attention bias scores was small, showing statistical significance in some analyses and not in others. on measures of social anxiety, intention-to-treat analyses (n = 326) revealed significant pre–post treatment declines with medium to large effect sizes in both training groups, whereas small declines in a waitlist group were nonsignificant. both training groups showed greater reductions in social anxiety than did waitlist; however, the benefits under these two training conditions were statistically indistinguishable. improvements in the two training conditions beyond those of waitlist could be attributable to any factors common to them, but not to the contingency training specific to active attention bias modification training.
effectiveness of role-playing as a pedagogical approach in construction education designing and delivering courses that impart essential learning objectives such as problem solving skills, decision making skills, communication skills, teambuilding, and leadership skills are critical for construction education. considering the complexity of the construction industry, it is of utmost importance to adopt student centered pedagogical strategies for their benefits. one such approach is role-playing teaching that has been successfully implemented in a number of construction programs as well as in various other disciplines. the strategy provides a unique opportunity to the students to assume roles of different project stakeholders and solve real life problems that have been replicated in the classrooms. this paper introduces the concept of role-playing teaching along with the benefits, and also identifies the probable courses in a typical construction program that can be benefitted from the adoption of this pedagogical strategy.
effect of polyurethane chemistry and protein coating on monocyte differentiation towards a wound healing phenotype macrophage. a biodegradable lysine diisocyanate-based poly(glycolide-co-epsilon-caprolactone)urethane network has been evaluated as a material for the construction of a macroporous bottom layer (dermal analogue) in a two-layer artificial skin. high rates of in vitro degradation were observed; degradation of the porous poly(glycolide-co-epsilon-caprolactone)urethane networks was faster in vivo than in vitro. subcutaneous implantation in guinea pigs showed that the porous polyurethane networks allowed rapid cell ingrowth, degraded almost completely 4-8 wk after implantation and evoked no adverse tissue reaction.
solvation and desolvation effects in protein folding: native flexibility, kinetic cooperativity and enthalpic barriers under isostability conditions. experimental data from global analyses of temperature (t) and denaturant dependence of the folding rates of small proteins led to an intrinsic enthalpic folding barrier hypothesis: to a good approximation, the t-dependence of folding rate under constant native stability conditions is arrhenius. furthermore, for a given protein, the slope of isostability folding rate versus 1/t is essentially independent of native stability. this hypothesis implies a simple relationship between chevron and eyring plots of folding that is easily discernible when both sets of rates are expressed as functions of native stability. using experimental data in the literature, we verify the predicted chevron-eyring relationship for 14 proteins and determine their intrinsic enthalpic folding barriers, which vary approximately from 15 kcal/mol to 40 kcal/mol for different proteins. these enthalpic barriers do not appear to correlate with folding rates, but they exhibit correlation with equilibrium unfolding enthalpy at room temperature. intrinsic enthalpic barriers with similarly high magnitudes apply as well to at least two cases of peptide-peptide and peptide-protein association, suggesting that these barriers are a hallmark of certain general and fundamental kinetic processes during folding and binding. using a class of explicit-chain c(alpha) protein models with constant elementary enthalpic desolvation barriers between c(alpha) positions, we show that small microscopic pairwise desolvation barriers, which are a direct consequence of the particulate nature of water, can act cooperatively to give rise to a significant overall enthalpic barrier to folding. this theoretical finding provides a physical rationalization for the high intrinsic enthalpic barriers in protein folding energetics. ramifications of entropy-enthalpy compensation in hydrophobic association for the height of enthalpic desolvation barrier are discussed.
optical characterization of two-layered turbid media for non-invasive, absolute oximetry in cerebral and extracerebral tissue we present near-infrared spectroscopy measurement of absolute cerebral hemoglobin concentration and saturation in a large sample of 36 healthy elderly (mean age, 85 ± 6 years) and 19 young adults (mean age, 28 ± 4 years). non-invasive measurements were obtained on the forehead using a commercially available multi-distance frequency-domain system and analyzed using a diffusion theory model for a semi-infinite, homogeneous medium with semi-infinite boundary conditions. our study included repeat measurements, taken five months apart, on 16 elderly volunteers that demonstrate intra-subject reproducibility of the absolute measurements with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.9 for absorption coefficient (μa), oxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hbo2]), and total hemoglobin concentration ([hbt]), 0.7 for deoxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hb]), 0.8 for hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sto2), and 0.7 for reduced scattering coefficient (μ's). we found significant differences between the two age groups. compared to young subjects, elderly subjects had lower cerebral [hbo2], [hb], [hbt], and sto2 by 10 ± 4 μm, 4 ± 3 μm, 14 ± 5 μm, and 6%±5%, respectively. our results demonstrate the reliability and robustness of multi-distance near-infrared spectroscopy measurements based on a homogeneous model in the human forehead on a large sample of human subjects. absolute, non-invasive optical measurements on the brain, such as those presented here, can significantly advance the development of nirs technology as a tool for monitoring resting/basal cerebral perfusion, hemodynamics, oxygenation, and metabolism.
diagnostic markers of ovarian cancer by high-throughput antigen cloning and detection on arrays. the her-2/neu protooncogene is amplified and overexpressed in 20-40% of invasive breast cancers. her-2/neu protein overexpression is associated with aggressive disease and is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in several subsets of patients. the protein may also be related to cancer formation, with overexpression being detectable in 50-60% of ductal carcinomas in situ. it has been suggested that it might be possible to develop specific t-cell therapy directed against proteins involved in malignant transformation. one question is whether normal proteins that are overexpressed are appropriate targets for therapeutic immune attack. this report demonstrates that some patients with her-2/neu-positive breast cancers have both existent cd4+ helper/inducer t-cell immunity and antibody-mediated immunity to her-2/neu protein. initial studies performed on 20 premenopausal breast cancer patients identified antibodies to her-2/neu in 11 individuals. similar antibody responses have been found in some normal individuals. the patient with the greatest antibody response was studied in detail. in addition to a humoral immune response this patient had evidence of a significant proliferative t-cell response to the her-2/neu protein and peptides. similar t-cell responses have been detected in additional patients. it has been assumed that patients would be immunologically tolerant to her-2/neu as a self-protein and that immunity might be difficult to generate. if immunity could be generated, the result might be destructive autoimmunity. the current data support the notion that her-2/neu-specific immunity might be used in therapy without destroying normal tissue but also raises questions as to the role of existent immunity in immune surveillance and cancer progression.
proteome-wide identification of lysine propionylation in thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria: geobacillus kaustophilus, thermus thermophilus, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, and rhodothermus marinus recent studies of protein post-translational modifications revealed that various types of lysine acylation occur in eukaryotic and bacterial proteins. lysine propionylation, a newly discovered type of acylation, occurs in several proteins, including some histones. in this study, we identified 361 propionylation sites in 183 mid-exponential phase and late stationary phase proteins from thermus thermophilus hb8, an extremely thermophilic eubacterium. functional classification of the propionylproteins revealed that the number of propionylation sites in metabolic enzymes increased in late stationary phase, irrespective of protein abundance. the propionylation sites on proteins expressed in mid-exponential and late stationary phases partially overlapped. furthermore, amino acid frequencies in the vicinity of propionylation sites differed, not only between the two growth phases but also relative to acetylation sites. in addition, 33.8% of mid-exponential phase–specific and 80.0% of late stationary phase–specific propionylations (n ≥ 2) implied that specific mechanisms regulate propionylation in the cell. moreover, the limited degree of overlap between lysine propionylation (36.8%) and acetylation (49.2%) sites in 67 proteins that were both acetylated and propionylated strongly suggested that the two acylation reactions are regulated separately by specific enzymes and may serve different functions. finally, we also found that eight propionylation sites overlapped with acetylation sites critical for protein functions such as schiff-base formation and ligand binding.
protein kinase c ( pkc )-a activation inhibits pkc-z and mediates the action of ped / pea-15 on glucose transport in the l 6 skeletal muscle cells we have used differential display to identify genes whose expression is altered in type 2 diabetes thus contributing to its pathogenesis. one mrna is overexpressed in fibroblasts from type 2 diabetics compared with non‐diabetic individuals, as well as in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues, two major sites of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. the levels of the protein encoded by this mrna are also elevated in type 2 diabetic tissues; thus, we named it ped for phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes. ped cloning shows that it encodes a 15 kda phosphoprotein identical to the protein kinase c (pkc) substrate pea‐15. the ped gene maps on human chromosome 1q21–22. transfection of ped/pea‐15 in differentiating l6 skeletal muscle cells increases the content of glut1 transporters on the plasma membrane and inhibits insulin‐stimulated glucose transport and cell‐surface recruitment of glut4, the major insulin‐sensitive glucose transporter. these effects of ped overexpression are reversed by blocking pkc activity. overexpression of the ped/pea‐15 gene may contribute to insulin resistance in glucose uptake in type 2 diabetes.
match graph construction for large image databases the widespread availability of digital cameras and ubiquitous internet access have facilitated the creation of massive image collections. these collections can be highly interconnected through implicit links between image pairs viewing the same or similar objects. we propose building graphs called image webs to represent such connections. while earlier efforts studied local neighborhoods of such graphs, we are interested in understanding global structure and exploiting connectivity at larger scales. we show how to efficiently construct image webs that capture the connectivity in an image collection using spectral graph theory. our technique can link together tens of thousands of images in a few minutes using a computer cluster. we also demonstrate applications for exploring collections based on global topological analysis.
development of a step counter based on artificial neural networks global navigation satellite systems (gnss)-based navigation with smartphones is very popular. but in areas where no gnss signal is found navigation could be useful. examples are navigation in shopping malls, in big offices, in train stations or museums. the goal is to estimate the position in gnss shaded areas to make navigation possible. the mems sensors (micro electro mechanical system) installed in current smartphones, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetic field sensor and barometer allow now navigation also in gnss shadowed areas. due to the low quality of these sensors, however, support of the position estimate is needed. in this work, a concept is presented for the construction of an indoor navigation system based on low-cost sensors of smartphones. the position estimate from the available sensor data forms the basis of the position determination. so position estimation is always possible independent of location. first results with kalman filter and particle filter are shown. the presented concept serves as a basis for the construction of a smartphone-based navigation solution for indoor use. therefore the available mems sensors should be used as a position estimator and a wide variety of supporting information can be processed. a first approach for implementation on a smartphone is shown as an example.
wing phosphorylation is a major functional determinant of the lrs14‐type biofilm and motility regulator abfr1 in sulfolobus acidocaldarius in this study, the in vitro and in vivo functions of the only two identified protein phosphatases, saci-ptp and saci-pp2a, in the crenarchaeal model organism sulfolobus acidocaldarius were investigated. biochemical characterization revealed that saci-ptp is a dual-specific phosphatase (against pser/pthr and ptyr), whereas saci-pp2a exhibited specific pser/pthr activity and inhibition by okadaic acid. deletion of saci_pp2a resulted in pronounced alterations in growth, cell shape and cell size, which could be partially complemented. transcriptome analysis of the three strains (δsaci_ptp, δsaci_pp2a and the mw001 parental strain) revealed 155 genes that were differentially expressed in the deletion mutants, and showed significant changes in expression of genes encoding the archaella (archaeal motility structure), components of the respiratory chain and transcriptional regulators. phosphoproteome studies revealed 801 unique phosphoproteins in total, with an increase in identified phosphopeptides in the deletion mutants. proteins from most functional categories were affected by phosphorylation, including components of the motility system, the respiratory chain, and regulatory proteins. in the saci_pp2a deletion mutant the up-regulation at the transcript level, as well as the observed phosphorylation pattern, resembled starvation stress responses. hypermotility was also observed in the saci_pp2a deletion mutant. the results highlight the importance of protein phosphorylation in regulating essential cellular processes in the crenarchaeon s. acidocaldarius.
protein polymorphism is negatively correlated with conservation of intronic sequences and complexity of expression patterns in drosophila melanogaster synonymous codons are not used equally in many organisms, and the extent of codon bias varies among loci. earlier studies have suggested that more highly expressed loci in drosophila melanogaster are more biased, consistent with findings from several prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes that codon bias is partly due to natural selection for translational efficiency. we link this model of varying selection intensity to the population-genetics prediction that the effectiveness of natural selection is decreased under reduced recombination. in analyses of 385 d. melanogaster loci, we find that codon bias is reduced in regions of low recombination (i.e., near centromeres and telomeres and on the fourth chromosome). the effect does not appear to be a linear function of recombination rate; rather, it seems limited to regions with the very lowest levels of recombination. the large majority of the genome apparently experiences recombination at a sufficiently high rate for effective natural selection against suboptimal codons. these findings support models of the hill-robertson effect and genetic hitchhiking and are largely consistent with multiple reports of low levels of dna sequence variation in regions of low recombination.
plant stem cell niches. four classes of floral homeotic mads domain proteins specify the identities of the four organ types in an arabidopsis flower. while the activities of the mads domain proteins are essentially confined to the flower or to the inflorescence, several genes, such as apetala2, hua1 and hua2, also act outside the flower in addition to their organ identity functions inside the flower. we identified a new gene, hua enhancer 1 (hen1) from a sensitized genetic screen in the hua1-1 hua2-1 background that is compromised in floral homeotic c function. we showed that hen1, like the c function gene agamous, acts to specify reproductive organ identities and to repress a function. hen1 also shares ag's non-homeotic function in controlling floral determinacy. hen1 may achieve these functions by regulating the expression of ag. hen1 single mutants exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes such as reduced organ size, altered rosette leaf shape and increased number of coflorescences, during most stages of development. therefore, hen1, like the a function gene ap2, plays multiple roles in plant development as well as acting in organ identity specification in the flower. hen1 codes for a novel protein and is expressed throughout the plant.

effects of electrical stimulation on meat quality of lamb and goat meat our study examined high and low voltage electrical stimulation and postmortem storage as strategies to improve tenderness and lean color in cabrito carcasses. boer cross (n=60) kids were assigned to either high (550 v), low (20 v), or no electrical stimulation treatments. no differences in muscle temperature were observed between treatments at any time measured. muscle ph declined fastest in high voltage treated carcasses. high voltage electrical stimulation slightly increased (p<0.05) b (∗) and a (∗) in the m. gluteus medius and tended to increase l (∗) and b (∗) (p=0.06 and 0.11, respectively) values in the m. longissimus thoracis. electrical stimulation had no effect on myofibril fragmentation at 1-, 3-, or 14-d postmortem or sarcomere length. high voltage electrical stimulation increased (p<0.05) tenderness at 1- and 3-d postmortem, but not at 14-d postmortem. aging for 3 d did not affect tenderness regardless of stimulation treatment, but aging time for 14 d improved (p<0.05) tenderness. these data indicate that high voltage electrical stimulation and 14 d aging were effective in improving the tenderness of meat from cabrito carcasses.
percutaneous lung biopsy after pneumonectomy: factors for improving success in the care of patients at high risk. 2division of abdominal imaging and interventional radiology, massachusetts general hospital, boston, ma. case history a 75-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with an acute myocardial infarction. the patient was a former heavy smoker. a chest radiograph revealed a left apical lung mass (fig. 1). a ct scan showed a cavitary left upper lobe lung mass measuring 3.5 × 4 cm (fig. 2a) with an additional 3 × 2 cm mass at the left hilum (fig. 2b). a wholebody pet scan showed the left upper lobe mass and at the left hilum, increased 18f-fdg uptake that was suggestive of lung neoplasm metastatic to the left hilum (fig. 3). therefore, a thoracic radiologist was consulted for biopsy of the left upper lobe lung mass. dr. titton. it is interesting to note that a pet scan was obtained for this patient. what is the role of 18f-fdg pet in the evaluation of patients with a pulmonary nodule or lung cancer? dr. kalra. in the evaluation of patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule, 18f-fdg pet improves characterization of the nodule by estimating the probability of malignancy. the high positive predictive value for malignancy in nodules greater than 1 cm in diameter suggests that those with positive scan results should undergo either percutaneous biopsy or surgical resection. histologic examination of pet-positive lesions is necessary because false-positive pet findings can be encountered with granulomatous lesions secondary to sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or infection [1]. false-negative pet findings are seen in patients with small lesions (< 1 cm) and in selected malignancies, such as bronchioalveolar cell carcinoma or well-differentiated adenocarcinoma or carcinoid tumor. for this reason, regardless of pet findings,
the power of rejection in online bottleneck matching given a set s ⊆ r of points on the line, we consider the task of matching a sequence (r1, r1,... ) of requests in r to points in s. it has been conjectured [online algorithms: the state of the art, lecture notes in computer science, vol. 1442, springer, berlin, 1998, pp. 268-280] that there exists a 9-competitive online algorithm for this problem, similar to the so-called "cow path" problem [inform. and comput. 106 (1993) 234-252]. we disprove this conjecture and show that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio strictly less than 9.001.our argument is based on a new proof for the optimality of the competitive ratio 9 for the "cow path" problem.
enhanced expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases in aniline-induced cell proliferation in rat spleen. cell cycle progression and cell division are driven by the sequential activation of a group of serine-threonine kinases called cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). multiple cdks control the cell cycle in mammals and have been long considered essential for normal proliferation, development and homeostasis. the importance of the cdk-cyclin complexes in cell proliferation is underscored by the fact that deregulation of the cdk activity is found in virtually the whole spectrum of human tumors. advances in the cell cycle proteins in the last 25 years, since the discovery of cyclins, have been discussed and have shed even more light on this essential life sustaining process. recent information from different models for the various cyclins and cdks have made some of the generally accepted concepts of cell cycle regulation to be revised and new and exciting questions to be investigated. there is also increasing evidence that suggests that cdks such as cdc2 are also commonly targeted by viral proteins, which modulate host cell cycle machinery to benefit viral survival or replication. this review, describes some of the most recent and important us patents related to cell cycle regulation and those on viral proteins involved in cell cycle modulation particularly the g2/m phase transition and cancer therapy.
conservative management of cecal diverticulitis mimicking acute appendicitis in a pregnant woman diverticula are herniations through the colonic wall and are therefore likely to be due to a weakness within the wall, an alteration in intracolonic pressures or a combination of these factors. this article reviews these aspects in relation to the pathogenesis of colonic diverticula.
species richness and cover along a 60-year chronosequence in old-fields of southeastern spain plant species diversity patterns of the rocky mountain forests were found to be at variance with patterns reported from other regions. the most centrally located forests in terms of elevation, site moisture and successional status were found to have the lowest diversity. in contrast, the peripheral and environmentally more severe sites were found to have relatively high diversity. in particular, the forest-grassland transition and the low elevation riparian forests have species diversity values as high as any yet reported from western north america. when diversity was examined in terms of variation across elevation or moisture gradients, varying results were obtained due to the interaction of these factors. the failure of previous studies to converge on generalizations about plant diversity reflects, in part, the failure of most investigators to view diversity in a regional context of variation across several interacting gradients. diversity was seen to vary inversely with the degree of development of the forest canopy. the interaction of different components of the forest community is one reason for the failure of general patterns of plant species diversity to emerge from previous studies. a potentially rich herb community can be greatly suppressed by a single species tree stratum. among the most successful work to date on species diversity is that on birds, a distinct albeit large and functional group. it is unlikely that similar success could have been achieved through work on all animal species simultaneously. this suggests the need to examine plant species diversity, not in terms of total diversity, but in terms of component functional groups, perhaps guilds, growing under similar microclimatic conditions and subject to similar competitive pressures.
pollination, wounding and jasmonate treatments induce the expression of a developmentally regulated pistil dioxygenase at a distance, in the ovary, in the wild potato solanum chacoense bitt. a heterologous cdna probe from petunia hybrida was used to isolate flavanone-3 beta-hydroxylase-encoding cdna clones from carnation (dianthus caryophyllus), china aster (callistephus chinensis) and stock (matthiola incana). the deduced protein sequences together with the known sequences of the enzyme from p. hybrida, barley (hordeum vulgare) and snapdragon (antirrhinum majus) enabled the determination of a consensus sequence which revealed an overall 84% similarity (53% identity) of flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylases from the different sources. alignment with the sequences of other known enzymes of the same class and to related non-heme iron-(ii) enzymes demonstrated the strict genetic conservation of 14 amino acids, in particular, of three histidines and an aspartic acid. the conservation of the histidine motifs provides strong support for the possible conservation of structurally similar iron-binding sites in these enzymes. the putative role of histidines as chelators of ferrous ions in the active site of flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylases was corroborated by diethyl-pyrocarbonate modification of the partially purified recombinant petunia enzyme.
obstruction degree: measuring concurrency in shared memory systems we propose obstruction-free step complexity, a new complexity measure for nonblocking algorithms. we believe that this measure provides a more pragmatic quanti.cation of nonblocking algorithms than previous measures, providing better guidance for designers of practical nonblocking algorithms.    in our opinion, the main shortcoming of existing complexity measures for nonblocking algorithms is that they are targeted towardsworst-case behavior inworstcase scenarios, and say little about behavior inmore common cases.this is true for the sensitivity measure of attiya and dagan [1], and the d-local step complexity of afek et al. [2]. these measures are directed at evaluating the behavior of algorithms under contention, i.e., when concurrent operations actively interfere with each other’s progress. however, in practice, a well-designed system manages contention so that it does not impact performance too greatly. thus, these previous measures do not evaluate the behaviour that is likely to be observed.
the role of gabab(1) receptor isoforms in anxiety and depression: genetic and pharmacological studies in the mouse b-type receptors for the neurotransmitter gaba (γ-aminobutyric acid) inhibit neuronal activity through g-protein-coupled second-messenger systems, which regulate the release of neurotransmitters and the activity of ion channels and adenylyl cyclase. physiological and biochemical studies show that there are differences in drug efficiencies at different gabab receptors, so it is expected that gabab-receptor (gababr) subtypes exist. two gabab-receptor splice variants have been cloned (gababr1a and gababr1b), but native gabab receptors and recombinant receptors showed unexplained differences in agonist-binding potencies. moreover, the activation of presumed effector ion channels in heterologous cells expressing the recombinant receptors proved difficult,. here we describe a new gabab receptor subtype, gababr2, which does not bind available gabab antagonists with measurable potency. gababr1a, gababr1b and gababr2 alone do not activate kir3-type potassium channels efficiently, but co-expression of these receptors yields a robust coupling to activation of kir3 channels. we provide evidence for the assembly of heteromeric gabab receptors in vivo and show that gababr2 and gababr1a/b proteins immunoprecipitate and localize together at dendritic spines. the heteromeric receptor complexes exhibit a significant increase in agonist- and partial-agonist-binding potencies as compared with individual receptors and probably represent the predominant native gabab receptor. heteromeric assembly among g-protein-coupled receptors has not, to our knowledge, been described before.
biophysical mechanism of spike threshold dependence on the rate of rise of the membrane potential by sodium channel inactivation or subthreshold axonal potassium current a slowly inactivating, low-threshold k(+) current has been implicated in the regulation of state transitions and repetitive activity in striatal medium spiny neurons. however, the molecular identity of the channels underlying this current and their biophysical properties remain to be clearly determined. because previous work had suggested this current arose from kv1 family channels, high-affinity toxins for this family were tested for their ability to block whole cell k(+) currents activated by depolarization of acutely isolated neurons. alpha-dendrotoxin, which blocks channels containing kv1.1, kv1.2, or kv1.6 subunits, decreased currents evoked by depolarization. three other kv1 family toxins that lack a high affinity for kv1.2 subunits, r-agitoxin-2, dendrotoxin-k, and r-margatoxin, failed to significantly reduce currents, implicating channels with kv1.2 subunits. rt-pcr results confirmed the expression of kv1.2 mrna in identified medium spiny neurons. currents attributable to kv1.2 channels activated rapidly, inactivated slowly, and recovered from inactivation slowly. in the subthreshold range (ca. -60 mv), these currents accounted for as much as 50% of the depolarization-activated k(+) current. moreover, their rapid activation and relatively slow deactivation suggested that they contribute to spike afterpotentials regulating repetitive discharge. this inference was confirmed in current-clamp recordings from medium spiny neurons in the slice preparation where kv1.2 blockade reduced first-spike latency and increased discharge frequency evoked from hyperpolarized membrane potentials resembling the "down-state" found in vivo. these studies establish a clear functional role for somato-dendritic kv1.2 channels in the regulation of state transitions and repetitive discharge in striatal medium spiny neurons.
parietotemporal stimulation affects acquisition of novel grapheme-phoneme mappings in adult readers 1 in this paper we demonstrate in the intact human the possibility of a non‐invasive modulation of motor cortex excitability by the application of weak direct current through the scalp. 2 excitability changes of up to 40 %, revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation, were accomplished and lasted for several minutes after the end of current stimulation. 3 excitation could be achieved selectively by anodal stimulation, and inhibition by cathodal stimulation. 4 by varying the current intensity and duration, the strength and duration of the after‐effects could be controlled. 5 the effects were probably induced by modification of membrane polarisation. functional alterations related to post‐tetanic potentiation, short‐term potentiation and processes similar to postexcitatory central inhibition are the likely candidates for the excitability changes after the end of stimulation. transcranial electrical stimulation using weak current may thus be a promising tool to modulate cerebral excitability in a non‐invasive, painless, reversible, selective and focal way.
genetic variability of respiratory syncytial virus a in hospitalized children in the last five consecutive winter seasons in central spain human respiratory syncytial virus (hrsv) is the main cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children under 2 years of age and causes repeated infections throughout life. we investigated the genetic variability of rsv-a circulating in ontario during 2010–2011 winter season by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the g glycoprotein gene. among the 201 consecutive rsv isolates studied, rsv-a (55.7%) was more commonly observed than rsv-b (42.3%). 59.8% and 90.1% of rsv-a infections were among children ≤12 months and ≤5 years old, respectively. on phylogenetic analysis of the second hypervariable region of the 112 rsv-a strains, 110 (98.2%) clustered within or adjacent to the na1 genotype; two isolates were ga5 genotype. eleven (10%) na1-related isolates clustered together phylogenetically as a novel rsv-a genotype, named on1, containing a 72 nucleotide duplication in the c-terminal region of the attachment (g) glycoprotein. the predicted polypeptide is lengthened by 24 amino acids and includes a23 amino acid duplication. using rna secondary structural software, a possible mechanism of duplication occurrence was derived. the 23 amino acid on1 g gene duplication results in a repeat of 7 potential o-glycosylation sites including three o-linked sugar acceptors at residues 270, 275, and 283. using phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood analysis, a total of 19 positively selected sites were observed among ontario na1 isolates; six were found to be codons which reverted to the previous state observed in the prototype rsv-a2 strain. the tendency of codon regression in the g-ectodomain may infer a decreased avidity of antibody to the current circulating strains. further work is needed to document and further understand the emergence, virulence, pathogenicity and transmissibility of this novel rsv-a genotype with a72 nucleotide g gene duplication.
a theory about why we forget what we once knew i know of no one who seriously maintains that interference among tasks is of no consequence in the production of forgetting. whether forgetting is conceptualized at a strict psychological level or at a neural level (e.g., neural memory trace), some provision is made for interference to account for at least some of the measured forgetting. the many studies on retroactive inhibition are probably responsible for this general agreement that interference among tasks must produce a sizable proportion of forgetting. by introducing an interpolated interfering task very marked decrements in recall can be produced in a few minutes in the laboratory. but there is a second generalization which has resulted from these studies, namely, that most forgetting must be a function of the learning of tasks which interfere with that which has already been learned (19). thus, if a single task is learned in the laboratory and retention measured after a week, the loss has been attributed to the interference from activities learned outside the laboratory during the week. it is this generalization with which i am concerned in the initial portions of this paper. now, i cannot deny the data which show large amounts of forgetting produced by an interpolated list in a few minutes in the laboratory. nor do i deny that this loss may be attributed to interference. but i will try to show 1 address of the president, midwestern psychological association, st. louis, missouri,
two domains of p 80 katanin regulate microtubule severing and spindle pole targeting by p 60 katanin microtubules are dynamic structures whose proper rearrangement during the cell cycle is essential for the positioning of membranes during interphase and for chromosome segregation during mitosis. the previous discovery of a cyclin b/cdc2-activated microtubule-severing activity in m-phase xenopus egg extracts suggested that a microtubule-severing protein might play an important role in cell cycle-dependent changes in microtubule dynamics and organization. however, the isolation of three different microtubule-severing proteins, p56, ef1alpha, and katanin, has only confused the issue because none of these proteins is directly activated by cyclin b/cdc2. here we use immunodepletion with antibodies specific for a vertebrate katanin homologue to demonstrate that katanin is responsible for the majority of m-phase severing activity in xenopus eggs. this result suggests that katanin is responsible for changes in microtubules occurring at mitosis. immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that katanin is concentrated at a microtubule-dependent structure at mitotic spindle poles in xenopus a6 cells and in human fibroblasts, suggesting a specific role in microtubule disassembly at spindle poles. surprisingly, katanin was also found in adult mouse brain, indicating that katanin may have other functions distinct from its mitotic role.
risk of tuberculosis in dialysis patients: a nationwide cohort study patients with chronic renal failure maintained on intermittent hemodialysis have frequent infections and a suboptimal response to vaccinations. dendritic cells are potent antigen-presenting cells essential for the initiation and maintenance of innate and adaptive immunity. in this study we used uremic sera from hemodialysis patients to measure its impact on monocyte and monocyte-derived dendritic cell function in vitro. monocytes from healthy and uremic subjects were isolated using immunomagnetic beads and differentiated into dendritic cells in the presence of either complete sera or sera from hemodialysis patients. dendritic cells from normal patients cultured in uremic sera had decreased endocytosis and impaired maturation. these cells, however, had enhanced il-12p70 production and increased allogeneic t-cell proliferation compared to cells of normal subjects cultured in normal sera. monocyte derived dendritic cells of hemodialysis patients cultured in either normal or uremic sera were functionally impaired for endocytosis and maturation but had enhanced il-12p70 production and allogeneic t-cell proliferation only when cultured with uremic sera. high concentrations of urea in normal sera inhibited all aspects of normal dendritic cell function in vitro. our study suggests that hemodialysis regimes tailored to remove uremic toxins more efficiently may improve immune functions of these patients.
molecular characterization of the porcine group a rotavirus nsp2 and nsp5/6 genes from são paulo state, brazil, in 2011/12 rotaviruses are generally species-specific, but cross-species transmission is possible, as has been demonstrated experimentally. several case studies have indicated infection of humans by animal rotaviruses. comparison of genetic sequences of human and animal rotaviruses often reveals close identity. surveillance of circulating rotaviruses in the human population has revealed the presence of several uncommon genotypes. many of these have been found in domestic animals, and it is possible that they arose in the human population through zoonotic transmission. the low incidence of uncommon strains would suggest that such transmission, or at least the establishment of an animal rotavirus or a human/animal reassortant virus in the human population, does not happen with any great frequency. however, many millions of people will be exposed year on year to animal rotaviruses. this happens within farming communities, and potentially to visitors to the countryside. there may be some measure of environmental contamination through livestock excrement. this exposure may not result in high levels of infection, but some infection could occur. there may be a continual input of rotavirus strains or sequences into the human population from the animal population albeit at a very low level.
profiling non-tuberculous mycobacteria in an asian setting: characteristics and clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients in singapore diseases and therapies that reduce cell-mediated immunity increase the risk of nontuberculous mycobacterial (ntm) disease. extrapulmonary ntm disease, including disseminated, skin, and catheter-related disease, is more common in immunosuppressed than immunocompetent patients. mycobacterium avium complex remains the most common cause of ntm infection, but rapid growers including mycobacterium abscessus, mycobacterium chelonae, and mycobacterium fortuitum play an important role in skin and catheter-related infections. with the exception of antibiotic prophylaxis for aids patients, the prevention of ntm remains difficult. management is complicated, involving restoration of immune function and removal of catheters in addition to treatment with species-specific antibiotics per current guidelines.
organic acid profile of isovaleric acidemia: a comprehensive metabolomics approach isovaleric acidemia (iva) is one of the most common organic acidemias found in south africa. since 1983, a significant number of iva cases have been identified in approximately 20,000 caucasian patients screened for metabolic defects. iva is caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of isovaleryl-coa dehydrogenase (ivd) resulting in the accumulation of isovaleryl-coa and its metabolites. in total, 10 iva patients and three carriers were available for phenotypic and genotypic investigation in this study. all patients were found to be homozygous for a single c.367 g > a (p.g123r) mutation. the amino acid substitution of a glycine to arginine resulted in a markedly reduced steady-state level of the ivd protein, which explains the nearly complete lack of ivd enzyme activity as assessed in fibroblast homogenates. despite the genetic homogeneity of this south african iva group, the clinical presentation varied widely, ranging from severe mental handicap and multiple episodes of metabolic derangement to an asymptomatic state. the variation may be due to poor dietary intervention, delayed diagnosis or even epigenetic and polygenetic factors of unknown origin.
oral exposure to inorganic arsenic: evaluation of its carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects monomethylarsonic acid (mmav) and dimethylarsinic acid (dmav) are active ingredients in pesticidal products used mainly for weed control. mmav and dmav are also metabolites of inorganic arsenic, formed intracellularly, primarily in liver cells in a metabolic process of repeated reductions and oxidative methylations. inorganic arsenic is a known human carcinogen, inducing tumors of the skin, urinary bladder, and lung. however, a good animal model has not yet been found. although the metabolic process of inorganic arsenic appears to enhance the excretion of arsenic from the body, it also involves formation of methylated compounds of trivalent arsenic as intermediates. trivalent arsenicals (whether inorganic or organic) are highly reactive compounds that can cause cytotoxicity and indirect genotoxicity in vitro. dmav was found to be a bladder carcinogen only in rats and only when administered in the diet or drinking water at high doses. it was negative in a two-year bioassay in mice. mmav was negative in 2-year bioassays in rats and mice. the mode of action for dmav-induced bladder cancer in rats appears to not involve dna reactivity, but rather involves cytotoxicity with consequent regenerative proliferation, ultimately leading to the formation of carcinoma. this critical review responds to the question of whether dmav-induced bladder cancer in rats can be extrapolated to humans, based on detailed comparisons between inorganic and organic arsenicals, including their metabolism and disposition in various animal species. the further metabolism and disposition of mmav and dmav formed endogenously during the metabolism of inorganic arsenic is different from the metabolism and disposition of mmav and dmav from exogenous exposure. the trivalent arsenicals that are cytotoxic and indirectly genotoxic in vitro are hardly formed in an organism exposed to mmav or dmav because of poor cellular uptake and limited metabolism of the ingested compounds. furthermore, the evidence strongly supports a nonlinear dose-response relationship for the biologic processes involved in the carcinogenicity of arsenicals. based on an overall review of the evidence, using a margin-of-exposure approach for mmav and dmav risk assessment is appropriate. at anticipated environmental exposures to mmav and dmav, there is not likely to be a carcinogenic risk to humans.
cellular neurochemical characterization and subcellular localization of phospholipase c β1 in rat brain upon activation of receptors coupled to the gq subclass of g proteins, phospholipase c (plc)β hydrolyses membrane phospholipid to yield a pair of second messengers, inositol 1,4,5‐trisphosphate and 1,2‐diacylglycerol. of four plcβ isoforms, plcβ1 is transcribed predominantly in the telencephalon and its gene inactivation in mice impairs metabotropic glutamate receptor‐ and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor‐dependent hippocampal oscillations, endocannabinoid production in the hippocampus and barrel formation in the somatosensory cortex. here we examined cellular and subcellular distributions of plcβ1 in adult mouse brains. in the telencephalon, high levels of plcβ1 were observed in principal neurons, including pyramidal cells in the cortex and hippocampus, granule cells and mossy cells in the dentate gyrus, and medium spiny neurons in the caudate‐putamen, whereas most interneurons had low levels of or were negative for plcβ1 and, instead, expressed plcβ4. by immunofluorescence, tiny clusters of plcβ1 were distributed in somatodendritic compartments of principal neurons and positioned close to those of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m1 and diacylglycerol lipase‐α, respectively. immunoelectron microscopy revealed that plcβ1 was often associated with the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, cell membrane or postsynaptic density. in particular, it was highly accumulated at the perisynapse of dendritic spines forming asymmetrical synapses. in the cerebellum, plcβ1 was generally low but was enriched in axons and dendrites of basket cells. these results suggest that plcβ1 is the key effector in telencephalic principal neurons and cerebellar interneurons. furthermore, the well‐orchestrated molecular arrangement appears to be the anatomical basis for the specificity, efficiency and convergence of the neuronal phosphoinositide signaling system.
the tc1/mariner dna transposons in the genome of mollusk littorina saxatilis a spontaneous white mutation recovered in drosophila mauritiana is unstable and reverts to normal eye color at a frequency greater than 4 per 1,000 x-chromosomes. germ line reversion occurs at a high rate in d. mauritiana males and in interspecific hybrid females, while the rate is depressed in d. mauritiana females. these events are not restricted to the germ line, as cases of variegated patterns of eye pigmentation, indicating somatic reversion, are recovered at a frequency comparable to that of the male germ line reversion rate. germ line reversion events are genetically stable, while the somatic variegation patterns are not heritable. the patterns of eye pigment variegation produced suggests that reversion events are occurring throughout development. whole genome dna digests blotted and probed with the cloned d. melanogaster white gene indicate that this unstable white mutation in d. mauritiana is associated with an insertion of dna that is lost upon reversion to wild type, indicating that this dna insert is in fact a transposable element.
epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, inhibits ebv-induced b lymphocyte transformation via suppression of rela acetylation. ikappabalpha is an inhibitory molecule that sequesters nf-kappab dimers in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. upon stimulation, nf-kappab moves to the nucleus and induces the expression of a variety of genes including ikappabalpha. this newly synthesized ikappabalpha also translocates to the nucleus, removes activated nf-kappab from its target genes, and brings it back to the cytoplasm to terminate the phase of nf-kappab activation. we show here that ikappabalpha enhances the transactivation potential of several homeodomain-containing proteins such as hoxb7 and pit-1 through a nf-kappab-independent association with histone deacetylase (hdac) 1 and hdac3 but not with hdac2, -4, -5, and -6. ikappabalpha bound both hdac proteins through its ankyrin repeats, and this interaction was disrupted by p65. immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated further that ikappabalpha acts by partially redirecting hdac3 to the cytoplasm. at the same time, an ikappabalpha mutant, which lacked a functional nuclear localization sequence, interacted very efficiently with hdac1 and -3 and intensively enhanced the transactivation potential of pit-1. our results support the hypothesis that the nf-kappab inhibitor ikappabalpha regulates the transcriptional activity of homeodomain-containing proteins positively through cytoplasmic sequestration of hdac1 and hdac3, a mechanism that would assign a new and unexpected role to ikappabalpha.
big data analytics with datalog queries on spark the management of web users' personal information is increasingly distributed across a broad array of applications and systems, including online social networks and cloud-based services. users wish to share data using these systems, but avoiding the risks of unintended disclosures or unauthorized access by applications has become a major challenge. we propose a novel access control model that operates within a distributed data management framework based on datalog. using this model, users can control access to data they own and control applications they run. they can conveniently specify access control policies providing flexible tuple-level control derived using provenance information. we present a formal specification of the model, an implementation built using an open-source distributed datalog engine, and an extensive experimental evaluation showing that the computational cost of access control is modest.
trait anxiety, state anxiety, and attentional bias to threat: assessing the psychometric properties of response time measures testing feasibility and efficacy of psychological treatment via mobile devices is important, given its potential benefits for high-dosage treatment delivery, widespread and inexpensive dissemination, and efficient research methods. we conducted the first randomized controlled trial of attention bias modification training delivered via smartphones, comparing this training to control training in a double-blind design, also including a waitlist condition. all participants performed a variant of dot-probe training involving faces with neutral and disgust (representative of social threat) expressions in brief sessions three times daily over 4 weeks on their own smartphones, at home or anywhere they chose. attention bias modification, also known as cognitive bias modification of attention, training included a contingency to induce attentional deployment away from disgust faces, whereas the control training included no contingency. participants completed weekly internet-based self-report symptom assessments as well as smartphone-delivered dot-probe attention bias assessments, whose reliability findings supported the viability of using smartphones for reaction-time based assessments. the between-groups training effect on attention bias scores was small, showing statistical significance in some analyses and not in others. on measures of social anxiety, intention-to-treat analyses (n = 326) revealed significant pre–post treatment declines with medium to large effect sizes in both training groups, whereas small declines in a waitlist group were nonsignificant. both training groups showed greater reductions in social anxiety than did waitlist; however, the benefits under these two training conditions were statistically indistinguishable. improvements in the two training conditions beyond those of waitlist could be attributable to any factors common to them, but not to the contingency training specific to active attention bias modification training.
effects of electrostimulation and plyometric training program combination on jump height in teenage athletes. numerous studies have used percutaneous electrical stimulation (pes) in the context of training programs to develop strength and physical performance in healthy populations (sedentary or trained). significant increases in muscle and fiber cross-sectional area, isokinetic peak torque, maximal isometric and dynamic strength, and motor performance skills have been found after pes training. these strength gains are explained on the basis of the characteristics of pes motor units (mus) recruitment: (a) a continuous and exhausting contractile activity in the same pool of mus during the entire exercise period, (b) a supramaximal temporal recruitment imposed by the high frequency chosen (up to 40 hz), and (c) a synchronous recruitment of neighboring fibers. the pes training method is complementary to voluntary training, mainly because the application of pes causes an unconventional spatial recruitment of mus that, depending on the muscular topography, may entail the preferential recruitment of the fast-twitch mus. in addition, the method does not specifically develop elasticity in skeletal muscle, and it must be accompanied by a technical workout.
arachidonic acid-induced apoptosis in rat hepatoma as-30d cells is mediated by reactive oxygen species. arachidonic acid and, to a smaller extent, oleic acid at micromolar concentrations decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential within as-30d rat hepatoma cells cultivated in vitro and increased cell respiration. the uncoupling effect of both fatty acids on cell respiration was partly prevented by cyclosporin a, blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. arachidonic acid increased the rate of reactive oxygen species (ros) production, while oleic acid decreased it. both fatty acids induced apoptotic cell death of as-30d cells, accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and association of proapoptotic bax protein with mitochondria; arachidonic acid being a more potent inducer than oleic acid. trolox, a potent antioxidant, prevented ros increase induced by arachidonic acid and protected the cells against apoptosis produced by this fatty acid. it is concluded that arachidonic and oleic acids induce apoptosis of as-30d hepatoma cells by the mitochondrial pathway but differ in the mechanism of their action: arachidonic acid induces apoptosis mainly by stimulating ros production, whereas oleic acid may contribute to programmed cell death by activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
hiv-1/parasite co-infection and the emergence of new parasite strains. using dna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we identified four distinct cryptosporidium genotypes in hiv-infected patients: genotype 1 (human), genotype 2 (bovine) cryptosporidium parvum, a genotype identical to c. felis, and one identical to a cryptosporidium sp. isolate from a dog. this is the first identification of human infection with the latter two genotypes.
verifying synchronization for atomicity violation fixing fixing software bugs has always been an important and time-consuming process in software development. fixing concurrency bugs has become especially critical in the multicore era. however, fixing concurrency bugs is challenging, in part due to non-deterministic failures and tricky parallel reasoning. beyond correctly fixing the original problem in the software, a good patch should also avoid introducing new bugs, degrading performance unnecessarily, or damaging software readability. existing tools cannot automate the whole fixing process and provide good-quality patches.  we present afix, a tool that automates the whole process of fixing one common type of concurrency bug: single-variable atomicity violations. afix starts from the bug reports of existing bug-detection tools. it augments these with static analysis to construct a suitable patch for each bug report. it further tries to combine the patches of multiple bugs for better performance and code readability. finally, afix's run-time component provides testing customized for each patch. our evaluation shows that patches automatically generated by afix correctly eliminate six out of eight real-world bugs and significantly decrease the failure probability in the other two cases. afix patches never introduce new bugs and usually have similar performance to manually-designed patches.
does male care, provided to immature individuals, influence immature fitness in rhesus macaques? in chacma baboons (papio hamadryas ursinus), adult males and lactating females form preferential associations, or ‘friendships’, that provide protection against potentially infanticidal attacks. little is known about the mechanisms by which males and females form friendships, or the function of friendships for males. we examined the relationship between mating activity, paternity and friendships over a 3-year period. a male’s proportion of consort activity with a female within and outside of her period of most likely conception, along with his dominance rank, each contributed importantly in models of paternity outcomes and formation of friendships. in 87% of births, the male that monopolized the greatest proportion of a female’s consort days during her last conceptive cycle was the father of her offspring. in 82% of the births where the female’s primary consort partner was present at parturition, he became her friend. when the primary consort partner was absent at parturition, females formed friendships with males that had monopolized the second or third greatest proportion of their previous consort days. similarly, 78% of males became friends with females with whom they had obtained their greatest consort success. such a flexible strategy based on probabilistic assessment of paternity may be adaptive for females, given unpredictable fluctuations in male presence within the group. in a mating system with high dominance-based reproductive skew, males may benefit by investing preferentially in those infants that they are most likely to have fathered.
abstract stimulus-specific adaptation models neurons in the primary auditory cortex respond less strongly to a commonly occurring “standard” tone than to the same tone when it is rare or “deviant.” this phenomenon, called “stimulus-specific adaptation” (ssa), has been proposed as a possible single-neuron correlate of the mismatch negativity, a cortical evoked potential associated with stimulus novelty. previous studies in cat did not observe ssa in single neurons in the auditory thalamus. however, these reports did not differentiate between the auditory thalamic subdivisions and did not examine the effects of changing the stimulus presentation rate. to explore the possibility of thalamic ssa more completely, we recorded extracellularly from 30 single units and 22 multiunit clusters in the ventral, medial, and dorsal subdivisions of the mouse medial geniculate body (mgb), while presenting the anesthetized animals with sequences of standard and deviant tones at interstimulus intervals of 400, 500 and 800 ms. we found ssa in the auditory thalamus at all three stimulus presentation rates, primarily in the medial subdivision but to a lesser degree also in the ventral mgb. thalamic ssa was evident from the earliest onset of tone-evoked activity, although the latencies of responses to standard and deviant tones were not significantly different. together with related findings of ssa in neurons of the “belt” regions of the inferior colliculus, these results demonstrate that ssa is present at subcortical levels, primarily in but not restricted to the nonlemniscal auditory pathway.
cyclin d1 promotes mitogen-independent cell cycle progression in hepatocytes. in tissue culture systems, p21 and p27 inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) activity and cell cycle progression in response to numerous stimuli, but little is known about their involvement in cell growth in vivo. we examined the modulation of cdk activity by these proteins after 70% partial hepatectomy (ph), an in vivo model of synchronous hepatocyte cell cycle progression. after ph in balb/c mice, p21 was induced during the prereplicative (g1) phase and was maximally expressed after peak hepatocyte dna synthesis. p27 was present in quiescent liver and was minimally induced after ph. p21 and p27 immunoprecipitated with cdk2, cdk4, and cyclin d1 in the regenerating liver. the activity of cdk2-, cdk4- and cyclin d1-associated kinases was upregulated after ph, and maximal activity of these enzyme complexes corresponded to peak dna synthesis. immunodepletion experiments suggested that p27 plays a role in downregulating cdk2 activity before and after peak dna synthesis. compared to cogenic wild-type mice, p21−/− mice demonstrated evidence of markedly accelerated hepatocyte progression through g1 phase after ph: dna synthesis, upregulation of cyclin a and pcna, induction of cyclin d1- and cdk2-associated kinase activity, and appearance of a phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (rb) species occurred earlier in the p21−/− mice. these results suggest that p21 and p27 modulate cdk activity in the regenerating liver, and that p21 regulates the rate of progression through g1 phase of the cell cycle in vivo.
global biogeography and local adaptation of streptomyces understanding how microbial genotypes are arrayed in space is crucial for identifying local factors that may influence the spatial distribution of genetic diversity. in this study we investigated variation in 16s rdna sequences and rep-pcr fingerprints of streptomyces stains isolated from prairie soil among three locations and four soil depths. substantial variation in streptomyces otu (operational taxonomic unit) and box-pcr fingerprint diversity was found among locations within a limited spatial area (1 m2). further, phylogenetic lineages at each location were distinct. however, there was little variation in genetic diversity among isolates from different soil depths and similar phylogenetic lineages were found at each depth. some clones were found at a localized scale while other clones had a relatively widespread distribution. there was poor correspondence between 16s rdna groupings and rep-pcr fingerprint groupings. the finding of distinct phylogenetic lineages and the variation in spatial distribution of clones suggests that selection pressures may vary over the soil landscape.
global signal modulation of single-trial fmri response variability: effect on positive vs negative bold response relationship the primary somatosensory cortex (si) has been shown to encode the intensity of a stimulus applied to the contralateral side of the body. recent studies have demonstrated that ipsilateral si is also involved in the processing of somatosensory information. in this study, we investigated the dependence of the negative bold response in ipsilateral si on the intensity of somatosensory stimulation. functional mri was performed in 12 healthy subjects during electrical median nerve stimulation at four different intensities. a monotonic relationship between stimulus intensity and the strength of the negative bold response in ipsilateral si was found. additionally, a psychophysiological experiment revealed tight coupling between the stimulus intensity applied to one hand and increased perceptual threshold of the other hand. these findings indicate a stimulus intensity-dependent inhibition of ipsilateral si.
factors associated with men’s assessment of prostate cancer treatment choice patients diagnosed with localized prostate carcinoma need to interpret complicated medical information to make an informed treatment selection from among treatments that have comparable efficacy but differing side effects. the authors reported initial results for treatment decision‐making strategies among men receiving definitive treatment for localized prostate carcinoma.
patterning of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived pan-mesoderm by activin a/nodal and bmp4 signaling requires fibroblast growth factor activity. the vertebrate fgf8 gene produces multiple protein isoforms by alternative splicing. two evolutionarily conserved spliceforms, fgf8a and fgf8b, exhibit distinct bioactivities, with fgf8b having a more potent inductive activity due to higher affinity for fgf receptors. to investigate the in vivo requirement for fgf8b, we created a splice-site mutation abolishing fgf8b expression in mice. analysis of this mutant has uncovered a novel function of fgf8 signaling before the onset of gastrulation. we show that the loss of fgf8b disrupts the induction of the brachyury gene in the pregastrular embryo and, in addition, disrupts the proper alignment of the anteroposterior axis with the shape of the embryo and the uterine axes at embryonic day (e) 6.5. importantly, fgf8-null embryos display the same phenotype as fgf8b-deficient embryos at e6.5, demonstrating that signaling by fgf8b is specifically required for development of the pregastrular embryo. by contrast, during gastrulation, fgf8a can partially compensate for the loss of fgf8b in mesoderm specification. we show that an increased level of fgf8a expression, which leads to fgf4 expression in the primitive streak, can also promote mesoderm migration in the absence of fgf8b. therefore, different fgf signals may have distinct requirements for the morphogenesis and gene regulation before and during gastrulation. importantly, our findings implicate fgf8 in the morphogenetic process that establishes the defined relationship between the axes of the embryo and the uterus at the beginning of gastrulation, a perplexing phenomenon discovered two decades ago.
drinking water turbidity and emergency department visits for gastrointestinal illness in atlanta, 1993–2004 study objective to investigate the association between drinking water quality and gastrointestinal illness in the elderly of philadelphia. design within the general population, children and the elderly are at highest risk for gastrointestinal disease. this study investigates the potential association between daily fluctuations in drinking water turbidity and subsequent hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness of elderly persons, controlling for time trends, seasonal patterns, and temperature using poisson regression analysis. setting and participants all residents of philadelphia aged 65 and older in 1992–1993 were studied through their medicare records. main results for philadelphia's population aged 65 and older, we found water quality 9 to 11 days before the visit was associated with hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness, with an interquartile range increase in turbidity being associated with a 9% increase (95% ci 5.3%, 12.7%). in the belmont service area, there was also an association evident at a lag of 4 to 6 days (9.1% increase, 95% ci 5.2, 13.3). both associations were stronger in those over 75 than in the population aged 65–74. this association occurred in a filtered water supply in compliance with us standards. conclusions elderly residents of philadelphia remain at risk of waterborne gastrointestinal illness under current water treatment practices. hospitalisations represent a very small percentage of total morbidity.
theory of mind deficit in subjects with alcohol use disorder: an analysis of mindreading processes. a growing body of literature views theory of mind (tom) as a complex activity involving related but different abilities (e.g., harrington, siegert, & mcclure, 2005; saxe, moran, scholz, & gabrieli, 2006; tirassa, bosco, & colle, 2006). this reflects in the types of experimental tasks that have been proposed in recent years for the assessment of tom in normal and abnormal populations, some of which focus on the ability to understand visual or other perceptual cues as hints to another individual’s mental states (e.g., baron-cohen, wheelwright, hill, raste, & plumb 2001; rutherford, baron-cohen, & wheelwright, 2002; golan, baron-cohen, hill, & rutherford, 2007) and others on the comprehension of complex mental states as encapsulated in short stories or linguistic questions (e.g., baron-cohen, o’riordan, stone, jones & plaitsed, 1999; happé, 1994; pons & harris, 2000). let us discriminate two facets of labels like tom or mindreading. one is the situated ability to understand and react to someone’s mental states (‘‘this thug is planning to assault me – i had better let him see that i carry a knife”); roughly, it is manifestations of this facet that are explored by the first type of experimental tasks mentioned above. another is the retrospective reconsideration of one’s own or another individual’s ways or ability to cope with mentalistic social cognition (‘‘i always feel in danger when people conceal their thoughts”); again roughly, it is manifestations of this facet that are explored by the second type of tasks. each facet may be further analyzed according to more detailed considerations like the distinction between an egocentric and an allocentric perspective or between the various types of epistemic, volitional and other mental states that humans may understand. particularly in developmental psychology, the difference between on-line and retrospective aspects of tom has also been compared to the distinction between implicit and explicit knowledge or functioning of tom (e.g., clements & perner, 1994); however, the latter distinction is often used intuitively, leaving many theoretical questions open (dienes & perner, 1999). to sum up, tom may be viewed as a sophisticated mental activity which allows to quickly form and handle local, situated ideas about oneself or the others in a specific moment as well as more general, less transient ideas about how one and the others tend to live and cope across any number of different and possibly hypothetical situations. both facets of tom have been a focus of research, but, to our knowledge, the conceptual and theoretical relations between them have never been worked out to any satisfactory level of detail and, as discussed above, the experimental paradigms with which they have been studied are quite different. the th.o.m.a.s. interview (bosco et al., 2009) is meant to investigate the retrospective facet of tom, based on a theoretically-driven decomposition thereof that aims at bringing its diversity and complexity into light. there is no way of doing this without recurring to the interviewee’s deliberate introspection and discursive abilities. it is possible that, as badgaiyan (2009) suggests, schizophrenia might affect differently the two facets of tom. yet, there is no reason to think that either one has a systematically more important causal role than the other in the mental life of a healthy or schizophrenic person. instead, they influence each other: the retrospective ability has to build in part upon the reconsideration of previous episodes and situations in which the on-line interpretation of mental states has yielded some interesting lesson to learn; conversely, the on-line interpretation of the current situation has to be informed in part by the individual’s general worldview and biography as well as by the outcomes of and reflections upon situations met in the past. we believe that the retrospective facet of tom plays a fundamental role and that it is crucial to our understanding of social cognition in schizophrenia and elsewhere. another issue raised by badgaiyan concerns the role that memory, language and iq may play in tom activities and in the relevant experimental tasks. truly, certain such activities and tasks require an adequate level of non-tom cognitive function-
degradation of mixtures of phenolic compounds by arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6 abstract arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6, a previously described 4-chlorophenol-degrading strain, was found to degrade 4-chlorophenol via hydroxyquinol, which is a novel route for aerobic microbial degradation of this compound. in addition, 10 open reading frames exhibiting sequence similarity to genes encoding enzymes involved in chlorophenol degradation were cloned and designated part of a chlorophenol degradation gene cluster (cph genes). several of the open reading frames appeared to encode enzymes with similar functions; these open reading frames included two genes, cpha-i and cpha-ii, which were shown to encode functional hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenases. disruption of the cpha-i gene yielded a mutant that exhibited negligible growth on 4-chlorophenol, thereby linking the cph gene cluster to functional catabolism of 4-chlorophenol in a. chlorophenolicus a6. the presence of a resolvase pseudogene in the cph gene cluster together with analyses of the g+c content and codon bias of flanking genes suggested that horizontal gene transfer was involved in assembly of the gene cluster during evolution of the ability of the strain to grow on 4-chlorophenol.
complementary roles of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma in inducible microglial nitric oxide generation we have reported recently that sodium butyrate suppressed ifn-gamma, but not the lps-mediated induction of nitric oxide and tnf-alpha in microglia via the specific inhibition of nf-kappab. in order to further determine the upstream signaling mechanism involved in the ifn-gamma-specific down-regulation of inos by sodium butyrate in microglia, this study investigated the effect of sodium butyrate on the map kinase activities. sodium butyrate significantly repressed the phosphorylation of erk induced by ifn-gamma, but had little effect on that induced by lps. this suggests that sodium butyrate suppresses the ifn-gamma-induced inos expression by inhibiting the erk to nf-kappab pathway. in addition, it was found that sodium butyrate suppressed the ifn-gamma-induced interferon regulatory factor 1 (irf-1) expression via the inhibition of erk. therefore, the erk signaling pathway appears to play a key role in the sodium butyrate-mediated down-regulation of inos in the ifn-gamma-stimulated microglia.
equity and efficiency in multi-worker firms: insights from experimental economics we study how different payment modes influence the effectiveness of gift exchange as a contract enforcement device. in particular, we analyze how horizontal fairness concerns affect performance and efficiency in an environment characterized by contractual incompleteness. in our experiment, one principal is matched with two agents. the principal pays equal wages in one treatment and can set individual wages in the other. we find that the use of equal wages elicits substantially lower efforts. this is not caused by monetary incentives per se since under both wage schemes it is profit-maximizing for agents to exert high efforts. the treatment difference instead seems to be driven by the fact that the norm of equity is violated far more frequently in the equal wage treatment. after having suffered from violations of the equity principle, agents withdraw effort. these findings hold even after controlling for the role of intentions, as we show in a third treatment. our results suggest that adherence to the norm of equity is a necessary prerequisite for successful establishment of gift-exchange relations.
surgical treatment of advanced heart failure: alternatives to heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory assist devices. objectives the purpose of this study was to compare postoperative outcome in two groups of patients with chronic severe aortic regurgitation (ar): those operated on early and those operated on late according to the guidelines.   background the impact of earlier surgery for chronic severe ar as defined in guidelines has not been evaluated.   methods a total of 170 patients with chronic severe ar submitted to aortic valve replacement were prospectively followed up. patients were divided in two groups depending on the clinical situation at the time of surgery. group a were 60 patients who were operated on following guidelines advice of earlier surgery, and group b were 110 patients who were operated on late with regard to guideline recommendations.   results follow-up was 10 +/- 6 years (1 to 22 years). during follow-up 44 patients died, 7 patients (12%) from group a and 37 (37%) from group b (p = 0.001). the cause of death was non-cardiac in 11 patients, 2 (3%) in group a and 9 (8%) in group b. cardiac deaths occurred in 33 patients, 5 (9%) from group a and 28 (28%) from group b (p = 0.002). causes of death differed between groups a and b: heart failure or sudden death were significantly more frequent in group b (20 patients vs. 1 patient, p = 0.001). overall survival in groups a and b was 90 +/- 4% vs. 75 +/- 8% at 5 years, 86 +/- 5% vs. 64 +/- 5% at 10 years, and 78 +/- 7% vs. 53 +/- 6% at 15 years, respectively (p = 0.009).   conclusions early operation as defined in the guidelines improves long-term survival in patients with chronic ar.
optimization of molecular approaches to genogroup neisseria meningitidis carriage isolates and implications for monitoring the impact of new serogroup b vaccines background in 1999, meningococcal serogroup c conjugate (mcc) vaccines were introduced in the united kingdom for those under 19 years of age. the impact of this intervention on asymptomatic carriage of meningococci was investigated to establish whether serogroup replacement or protection by herd immunity occurred.   methods multicenter surveys of carriage were conducted during vaccine introduction and on 2 successive years, resulting in a total of 48,309 samples, from which 8599 meningococci were isolated and characterized by genotyping and phenotyping.   results a reduction in serogroup c carriage (rate ratio, 0.19) was observed that lasted at least 2 years with no evidence of serogroup replacement. vaccine efficacy against carriage was 75%, and vaccination had a disproportionate impact on the carriage of sequence type (st)-11 complex serogroup c meningococci that (rate ratio, 0.06); these meningococci also exhibited high rates of capsule expression.   conclusions the impact of vaccination with mcc vaccine on the prevalence of carriage of group c meningococci was consistent with herd immunity. the high impact on the carriage of st-11 complex serogroup c could be attributed to high levels of capsule expression. high vaccine efficacy against disease in young children, who were not protected long-term by the schedule initially used, is attributed to the high vaccine efficacy against carriage in older age groups.
effects of corn particle size and physical form of the diet on the gastrointestinal structures of broiler chickens diets were prepared with corn, wheat, or sorghum ground in a hammer mill and sieved to obtain coarse, medium, and fine particle size fractions. their effect on broiler performance from hatch to 7 d and from 7 to 21 d of age was studied. the effect of particle size on the size and ph of the gastrointestinal organs was also determined. the three textures obtained for each grain were uniform in geometric mean diameter (gmd) and geometric standard deviation (gsd). grain by texture interactions were not significant. independent of grain source, the best performance was obtained with diets prepared from the medium texture. in these diets, the gmd of the grains varied from 1.13 to 1.23 mm and the gsd from 1.19 to 1.35. the fine fraction (gmd .57 to .67 mm) resulted in the lowest performance and that resulting from the coarse fraction (gmd 2.01 to 2.10 mm) was intermediate. at 7 and 21 d of age, gizzard weight and content were positively related to particle size. at the age of 21 d, duodenum weight and content was highest in chicks fed the fine diets. the ph of the gizzard content decreased with increasing grain particle size, whereas that of the small intestinal content increased. some grain effects were also observed on the gastrointestinal tract. gizzard weight was greatest in the cornfed birds. wheat-fed chicks had the heavier intestines and contents. after overnight feed deprivation, feed consumption by 7-d-old chicks was related to the particle size during the first 2 h of refeeding, with greater intake of medium and coarse grains.
efficiency of transcriptional gene silencing of gbssi in potato depends on the promoter region that is used in an inverted repeat two distinct gene-silencing phenomena are observed in plants: transcriptional gene silencing (tgs), which involves decreased rna synthesis because of promoter methylation, and posttranscriptional gene silencing (ptgs), which involves sequence-specific rna degradation. ptgs is induced by deliberate [1-4] or fortuitous production (r.v.b., unpublished data) of double-stranded rna (dsrna). tgs could be the result of dna pairing [5], but could also be the result of dsrna, as was shown by the dsrna-induced inactivation of a transgenic promoter [6]. here, we show that when targeting flower pigmentation genes in petunia, transgenes expressing dsrna can induce ptgs when coding sequences are used and tgs when promoter sequences are taken. for both types of silencing, small rna species are found, which are thought to be dsrna decay products [7] and determine the sequence specificity of the silencing process [8, 9]. furthermore, silencing is accompanied by the methylation of dna sequences that are homologous to dsrna. dna methylation is assumed to be essential for regulating tgs and important for reinforcing ptgs [10]. therefore, we conclude that tgs and ptgs are mechanistically related. in addition, we show that dsrna-induced tgs provides an efficient tool to generate gene knockouts, because not only does the tgs of a ptgs-inducing transgene fully revert the ptgs phenotype, but also an endogenous gene can be transcriptionally silenced by dsrna corresponding to its promoter.
costal2 functions as a kinesin-like protein in the hedgehog signal transduction pathway axoplasm from the squid giant axon contains a soluble protein translocator that induces movement of microtubules on glass, latex beads on microtubules, and axoplasmic organelles on microtubules. we now report the partial purification of a protein from squid giant axons and optic lobes that induces these microtubule-based movements and show that there is a homologous protein in bovine brain. the purification of the translocator protein depended primarily on its unusual property of forming a high affinity complex with microtubules in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable atp analog, adenylyl imidodiphosphate. the protein, once released from microtubules with atp, migrates on gel filtration columns with an apparent molecular weight of 600 kilodaltons and contains 110-120 and 60-70 kilodalton polypeptides. this protein is distinct in molecular weight and enzymatic behavior from myosin or dynein, which suggests that it belongs to a novel class of force-generating molecules, for which we propose the name kinesin.
an analysis of large-strain damage elastoplasticity in this paper a scalar-valued isotropic tensor function is considered, the variables of which are constitutive tensors of orders two and four, for instance, characterizing the anisotropic properties of a material. therefore, the system of irreducible invariants of a fourth-order tensor is constructed. furthermore, the joint or simultaneous invariants of a second-order and a fourth-order tensor are found. in a similar way one can construct an integrity basis for a tensor of order greater than four, as shown in the paper, for instance, for a tensor of order six.
nmda receptor regulation prevents regression of visual cortical function in the absence of mecp2 motor and cognitive functions are severely impaired in rett syndrome (rtt). here, we examined local synaptic circuits of layer 2/3 (l2/3) pyramidal neurons in motor-frontal cortex of male hemizygous mecp2-null mice at 3 to 4weeks of age. we mapped local excitatory input to l2/3 neurons using glutamate uncaging and laser scanning photostimulation, and compared synaptic input maps recorded from mecp2-null and wild type (wt) mice. local excitatory input was significantly reduced in the mutants. the strongest phenotype was observed for lateral (horizontal, intralaminar) inputs, that is, l2/3-->2/3 inputs, which showed a large reduction in mecp2(-/y) animals. neither the amount of local inhibitory input to these l2/3 pyramidal neurons nor their intrinsic electrophysiological properties differed by genotype. our findings provide further evidence that excitatory networks are selectively reduced in rtt. we discuss our findings in the context of recently published parallel studies using selective mecp2 knockdown in individual l2/3 neurons.
foreground segmentation of live videos using locally competing 1svms this paper examines the problem of moving object detection. more precisely, it addresses the difficult scenarios where background scene textures in the video might change over time. in this paper, we formulate the problem mathematically as minimizing a constrained risk functional motivated from the large margin principle. it is a generalization of the one class support vector machines (1-svms) [17] to accommodate spatial interactions, which is further incorporated into an online learning framework to track temporal changes. as a result it yields a closed-form update formula, a central component of the proposed algorithm to enable prompt adaptation to spatio-temporal changes. we also analyze the mistake bound and discuss issues such as dealing with non-stationary distributions, making use of kernels and efficient inference by a variant of dynamic programming. by exploiting the inherently concurrent structure, the proposed approach is designed to work with the highly parallel graphics processors (gpus) to facilitate realtime analysis. our empirical study demonstrates that the proposed approach works in realtime (over 80 frames per second) and at the same time performs competitively against state-of-the-art offline and quasi-realtime methods.
the tapeworm atractolytocestus tenuicollis (cestoda: caryophyllidea)—a sister species or ancestor of an invasive a. huronensis? the following caryophyllidean tapeworms were found in freshwater fishes from japan (species reported from japan for the first time marked with an asterisk): family caryophyllaeidae: paracaryophyllaeus gotoi (motomura, 1927) from misgurnus anguillicaudatus (cantor); archigetes sieboldi leuckart, 1878 from pseudorasbora parva (temminck et schlegel) and sarcocheilichthys variegatus microoculus mori (new hosts); family lytocestidae: *caryophyllaeides ergensi scholz, 1990 from tribolodon hakuensis (günther), t. ezoe okada et ikeda, hemibarbus barbus (temminck et schlegel) and chaenogobius sp. (new hosts); khawia japonensis (yamaguti, 1934) from cyprinus carpio linnaeus; k. sinensis hsü, 1935 from h. barbus (new host) and c. carpio; *k. parva (zmeev, 1936) from carassius auratus langsdorfii valenciennes in cuvier et valenciennes and carassius sp. (new hosts); and *atractolytocestus sagittatus (kulakovskaya et akhmerov, 1962) from c. carpio; family capingentidae: *breviscolex orientalis kulakovskaya, 1962 from h. barbus (new host); and caryophyllidea gen. sp. (probably breviscolex orientalis) from c. carpio. the validity of c. ergensi, originally described from leuciscus leuciscus baicalensis from mongolia, is confirmed on the basis of an evaluation of extensive material from japan. atractolytocestus sagittatus (syn. markevitschia sagittata) is tentatively considered a valid species, differing from the only congener, a. huronensis anthony, 1958, in its considerably greater number of testes.
sexual differences in responses to cross-species call interference in the green treefrog (hyla cinerea) in many species, males advertise to both male and female audiences. given the asymmetry in fitness costs of recognition errors in response to mating signals for the sexes, usually higher for females than males, males are expected to be more permissive than females in their responses to signals. few studies, however, have investigated such differences and there is no consensus on which sex is more permissive to signal variation. we examined the evoked vocal responses of male tungara frogs, physalaemus pustulosus, to 14 species of heterospecific and ancestral male mating calls to evaluate the influence of call similarity and phylogenetic distance on their responses. we also compared male calling responses to female phonotactic responses to examine the propensity of response errors between the sexes. recognition errors were higher for males than females, as predicted by the different costs associated with recognition errors for each sex. males responded to the calls of most species with mating calls, and produced aggressive calls in response to two other heterospecific/ancestral calls. the responses of males were explained by phylogenetic distance but not by overall call similarity. similarly, females were more likely to show phonotaxis to calls of species and ancestors that were more closely related. therefore, evolutionary history has left a perceptual footprint on the brain of both sexes but the details seem to differ. we discuss proximate reasons underlying sexual differences in receiver permissiveness in tungara frogs and potential factors leading to their evolution.
prevalence of amblyopia and refractive errors among primary school children purpose. to determine the prevalence of amblyopia, strabismus, and refractive errors in children entering school. methods. in this cross-sectional population-based study, 6-year-old children enrolling in shahrood schools were randomly sampled. those with organic blindness or mental retardation were excluded. ocular alignment, visual acuity, stereopsis, cover testing, and cycloplegic refraction were recorded for all children by an optometrist. a diagnosis of amblyopia was based on a best-corrected visual acuity of 6/12 or less in one or both eyes, or a bilateral difference of at least two best-corrected visual acuity lines. results. a total of 902 children were invited for optometry examinations, among which 827 (91.7%) responded and 815 children (98.5%) were included in the study. the prevalence of significantly reduced visual acuity (uncorrected va ≤6/12 in either eye) and amblyopia was 3.6 and 1.7%, respectively. the prevalence of hyperopia (+2.00 d or worse), myopia (−0.50 d or worse), astigmatism (0.75 d or worse), and anisometropia (1.00 d or more) were 20.5, 1.7, 19.6, and 2.2%, respectively. significant refractive error, defined as hyperopia >+3.50 d, myopia >−3.00 d, astigmatism >1.50 d in the orthogonal meridian or >1.00 d in the oblique meridian, or anisometropia (hyperopic >1.00 d, myopic >3.00 d) was detected in 2.1, 0.1, 5.0, and 0.9% of the sample, respectively. strabismus was diagnosed in 1.2% of children. overall, 52 children (6.4%; 95% confidence interval [ci], 4.7–8.1%) were at risk of amblyopia; of these, 81% had significant refractive errors, 11% had strabismus, and 8% had both. conclusion. a considerable proportion of 6-year-old children have strabismus and/or significant, potentially amblyogenic refractive errors. the relatively high rate of hyperopia and astigmatism in the studied population needs more attention. the results of the study emphasize the need for adequate diagnostic and therapeutic eye care services for preschool children.
stimulus disparity and punisher control of human signal-detection performance. three experiments using human participants varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers or point-loss punishers in two-alternative signal-detection procedures. experiment 1 varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers for correct responses (group a) and point-loss punishers for errors (group b) across conditions. response bias varied systematically as a function of the relative reinforcer or punisher frequencies. experiment 2 arranged two conditions - one where an unequal ratio of reinforcement (5ratio1 or 1ratio5) was presented without punishment (r-only), and another where the same reinforcer ratio was presented with an equal distribution of point-loss punishers (r+p). response bias was significantly greater in the r-only condition than the r+p condition, supporting a subtractive model of punishment. experiment 3 varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers for correct responses across four unequal reinforcer ratios (5ratio1, 2ratio1, 1ratio2, 1ratio5) both without (r-only) and with (r+p) an equal distribution of point-loss punishers for errors. response bias varied systematically with changes in relative reinforcer frequency for both r-only and r+p conditions, with 5 out of 8 participants showing increases in sensitivity estimates from r-only to r+p conditions. overall, the results indicated that punishers have similar but opposite effects to reinforcers in detection procedures and that combined reinforcer and punisher effects might be better modeled by a subtractive punishment model than an additive punishment model, consistent with research using concurrent-schedule choice procedures.
rap1 and canoe/afadin are essential for establishment of apical–basal polarity in the drosophila embryo regulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction is essential for the normal physiology of metazoans and is important in many diseases. integrin adhesion receptors can rapidly increase their affinity (integrin activation) in response to intracellular signaling events in a process termed inside-out signaling. the transmembrane domains of integrins and their interactions with the membrane are important in inside-out signaling. moreover, integrin activation is tightly regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways. here, we review recent progress in understanding how the membrane environment can, in cooperation with integrin-binding proteins, regulate integrin activation.
ramadan fasting and maternal perspectives in healthy pregnant women : systematic review objectiveto determine the effects of fasting during the month of ramadan on fetal development and maternal serum cortisol and lipid profile.methodsthis study was performed in obstetrics and gynecology department of gaziantep university hospital, between 23 september 2006 and 23 october 2006 (during the month of ramadan). thirty-six consecutive healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of 20 weeks or more, who were fasting during ramadan, were included in the study group (group 1). the control group (group 2) consisted of 29 healthy pregnant women, who were not fasting during the study period. for evaluating ramadan’s effect on fetus, doppler ultrasonography was performed on all subjects in the beginning and then once a week until the end of ramadan for the following measurements: increase of fetal biparietal diameter (bpd), increase of fetal femur length (fl), increase of estimated fetal body weight (efbw), fetal biophysical profile (bpp), amniotic fluid index (afi), and umbilical artery systole/diastole (s/d) ratio.maternal serum cortisol, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (ldl), high-density lipoprotein (hdl), very low density lipoprotein (vldl), and ldl/hdl ratio were also evaluated before and after ramadan.resultsno significant difference was found between the two groups for the fetal age, maternal weight gain (kilogram), estimated fetal weight gain (efwg), fetal bpp, afi, and umbilical artery s/d ratio. in the fasting group, the maternal serum cortisol levels on day 20 were significantly higher than the initial levels obtained 1 week prior to ramadan (p < 0.05). although no significant increases were observed in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the fasting group, these increases were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05). ldl and vldl levels showed a non-significant decrease at the end of the ramadan. hdl levels showed a slight increase, but ldl/hdl ratios were significantly decreased in fasting group (p < 0.05).conclusionthe results of this study showed that maternal serum cortisol level was elevated while ldl/hdl ratio were decreased in healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of 20 weeks or more, who were fasting during ramadan. no untoward effect of ramadan was observed on intrauterine fetal development.
energy landscapes shape microbial communities in hydrothermal systems on the arctic mid-ocean ridge numerical models are employed to investigate sources of chemical energy for autotrophic microbial metabolism that develop during mixing of oxidized seawater with strongly reduced fluids discharged from ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems on the seafloor. hydrothermal fluids in these systems are highly enriched in h(2) and ch(4) as a result of alteration of ultramafic rocks (serpentinization) in the subsurface. based on the availability of chemical energy sources, inferences are made about the likely metabolic diversity, relative abundance, and spatial distribution of microorganisms within ultramafic-hosted systems. metabolic reactions involving h(2) and ch(4), particularly hydrogen oxidation, methanotrophy, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis, represent the predominant sources of chemical energy during fluid mixing. owing to chemical gradients that develop from fluid mixing, aerobic metabolisms are likely to predominate in low-temperature environments (<20-30 degrees c), while anaerobes will dominate higher-temperature environments. overall, aerobic metabolic reactions can supply up to approximately 7 kj of energy per kilogram of hydrothermal fluid, while anaerobic metabolic reactions can supply about 1 kj, which is sufficient to support a maximum of approximately 120 mg (dry weight) of primary biomass production by aerobic organisms and approximately 20-30 mg biomass by anaerobes. the results indicate that ultramafic-hosted systems are capable of supplying about twice as much chemical energy as analogous deep-sea hydrothermal systems hosted in basaltic rocks.
factor receptor signaling cancer by inducing anoikis resistance and augmenting growth loss of p120-catenin induces metastatic progression of breast dental enamel development occurs in stages. the ameloblast cell layer is adjacent to, and is responsible for, enamel formation. when rodent pre-ameloblasts become tall columnar secretory-stage ameloblasts, they secrete enamel matrix proteins, and the ameloblasts start moving in rows that slide by one another. this movement is necessary to form the characteristic decussating enamel prism pattern. thus, a dynamic system of intercellular interactions is required for proper enamel development. cadherins are components of the adherens junction (aj), and they span the cell membrane to mediate attachment to adjacent cells. p120 stabilizes cadherins by preventing their internalization and degradation. so, we asked if p120-mediated cadherin stability is important for dental enamel formation. targeted p120 ablation in the mouse enamel organ had a striking effect. secretory stage ameloblasts detached from surrounding tissues, lost polarity, flattened, and ameloblast e- and n-cadherin expression became undetectable by immunostaining. the enamel itself was poorly mineralized and appeared to be composed of a thin layer of merged spheres that abraded from the tooth. significantly, p120 mosaic mouse teeth were capable of forming normal enamel demonstrating that the enamel defects were not a secondary effect of p120 ablation. surprisingly, blood-filled sinusoids developed in random locations around the developing teeth. this has not been observed in other p120-ablated tissues and may be due to altered p120-mediated cell signaling. these data reveal a critical role for p120 in tooth and dental enamel development and are consistent with p120 directing the attachment and detachment of the secretory stage ameloblasts as they move in rows.
motivational effects of opiates in conditioned place preference and aversion paradigm—a study in three inbred strains of mice rationalein previous studies, we have demonstrated that mice of the inbred strain c57bl/6j (c57) are more susceptible to amphetamine-induced conditioned place preference (cpp) than dba/2j (dba) mice. moreover, we also observed parallel strain differences for the locomotor-stimulant effects of the drug. however, other studies have reported either no difference or opposite strain differences for cocaine- and morphine-induced cpp as well as for the locomotor effects of these drugs, suggesting that amphetamine-related behavioral phenotypes might depend on a specific pharmacological action of the psychostimulant.objectivesthis study was aimed at testing strain differences for cocaine- and morphine-related behavioral phenotypes in the same experimental protocol and conditions previously used for amphetamine.methodsc57 and dba mice were tested for cpp induced by cocaine (0, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) and morphine (0, 5, 7.5, and 10 mg/kg). locomotor activity data were simultaneously obtained by measuring distance moved during all different cpp phases and unconditioned locomotor activity, behavioral sensitization and conditioned hyperactivity were measured together with cpp.results(a) either cocaine or morphine promoted significant cpp at lower doses in c57 than in dba mice; (b) only drug-trained c57 mice showed a significant cpp compared with the control group; and (c) only c57 mice showed dose-dependent effects of cocaine on cpp. moreover, there was no relationship between drug-induced cpp and locomotion.conclusionsthe results demonstrate that c57 and dba mice differ in their sensitivity to cocaine- and morphine-induced cpp and suggest that the two strains differ in sensitivity to the positive incentive properties of drugs of abuse.
particle impact on metal substrates with application to foreign object damage to aircraft engines the role of foreign-object damage (fod) and its effect on high-cycle fatigue (hgf) failures in a turbine engine ti– 6al–4v alloy is examined in the context of the use of the kitagawa–takahashi diagram to describe the limiting conditions for such failures. experimentally, fod is simulated by firing 1and 3.2 mm diameter steel spheres onto the flat specimen surface of tensile fatigue specimens at velocities of 200 and 300 m/s. such damage was found to markedly reduce the fatigue strength of the alloy, primarily due to four factors: stress concentration, microcrack formation, impact-induced plasticity and tensile residual stresses associated with the impact damage. two groups of fatigue failures could be identified. the first group initiated directly at the impact site, and can be readily described through the use of a fatigue-crack growth threshold concept. specifically, a kitagawa–takahashi approach is presented where the limiting threshold conditions are defined by the stress-concentration corrected smooth-bar fatigue limit (at microstructurally small crack sizes) and a ‘‘worst-case’’ fatigue-crack growth threshold (at larger crack sizes). the second group of failures was caused by fatigue cracks that initiated at locations far from the impact site in regions of high tensile residual stresses, the magnitude of which was computed numerically and measured experimentally using synchrotron x-ray diffraction. specifically, these failures could be rationalized due to the superposition of the residual stresses on the farfield applied mean stress, leading to a locally elevated load ratio (ratio of minimum to maximum loads). the effects of residual stress, stress concentration, and microstructurally small cracks are combined in a modified kitagawa– takahashi approach to provide a mechanistic basis for evaluating the detrimental effect of fod on hcf failures in ti– 6al–4v blade alloys. 2002 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.
chromosomal microarray analysis of consecutive individuals with autism spectrum disorders using an ultra-high resolution chromosomal microarray optimized for neurodevelopmental disorders copy number variants (cnvs) as detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (cma) significantly contribute to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as developmental delay (dd), intellectual disability (id), and autism spectrum disorder (asd). this study summarizes the results of 3.5 years of cma testing by a clia-certified clinical testing laboratory 5487 patients with neurodevelopmental conditions were clinically evaluated for rare copy number variants using a 2.8-million probe custom cma optimized for the detection of cnvs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. we report an overall detection rate of 29.4% in our neurodevelopmental cohort, which rises to nearly 33% when cases with dd/id and/or mca only are considered. the detection rate for the asd cohort is also significant, at 25%. additionally, we find that detection rate and pathogenic yield of cma vary significantly depending on the primary indications for testing, the age of the individuals tested, and the specialty of the ordering doctor. we also report a significant difference between the detection rate on the ultrahigh resolution optimized array in comparison to the array from which it originated. this increase in detection can significantly contribute to the efficient and effective medical management of neurodevelopmental conditions in the clinic.
escape of sgs1 from rad9 inhibition reduces the requirement for sae2 and functional mrx in dna end resection abstract the mre11 complex is a central component of the dna damage response, with roles in damage sensing, molecular bridging, and end resection. we have previously shown that in saccharomyces cerevisiae, ku70 (yku70) deficiency reduces the ionizing radiation sensitivity of mre11δ mutants. in this study, we show that yku70 deficiency suppressed the camptothecin (cpt) and methyl methanesulfonate (mms) sensitivity of nuclease-deficient mre11-3 and sae2δ mutants in an exo1-dependent manner. cpt-induced g2/m arrest, γ-h2ax persistence, and chromosome breaks were elevated in mre11-3 mutants. these outcomes were reduced by yku70 deficiency. given that the genotoxic effects of cpt are manifest during dna replication, these data suggest that ku limits exo1-dependent double-strand break (dsb) resection during dna replication, inhibiting the initial processing steps required for homology-directed repair. we propose that mre11 nuclease- and sae2-dependent dna end processing, which initiates dsb resection prevents ku from engaging dsbs, thus promoting exo1-dependent resection. in agreement with this idea, we show that ku affinity for binding to short single-stranded overhangs is much lower than for blunt dna ends. collectively, the data define a nonhomologous end joining (nhej)-independent, s-phase-specific function of the ku heterodimer.
comparison of electromyography and force as interfaces for prosthetic control. the characteristics of simple pursuit and compensatory manual control systems were measured with, a family of gaussian input signals having power-density spectra that covered a range of bandwidths, center frequencies, and some variety of shapes. the experimental results, presented in the form of graphs, show the nature of the dependence of human operator characteristics upon input-signal characteristics. the superiority of pursuit systems over compensatory systems is clearly demonstrated. simple analytic models that approximate these measured results are derived for both systems. the compensatory model is highly developed and relations among its parameters and those of the input have been obtained. the pursuit model is not so well developed and only approximate relations among its parameters and the input parameters have been found. the measured results and the analytic models together provide a description of manual control systems that should be useful in design of control systems.
sexual dysfunction in pre-menopausal diabetic women: clinical, metabolic, psychological, cardiovascular, and neurophysiologic correlates sexual functioning consists of several phases: desire, arousal, plateau, orgasm, and resolution (1). sexual arousal results from a spinal cord reflex. spinal segments are under excitatory and inhibitory control from supramechanisms, i.e. hypothalamus with its excitatory and androgen receptors. the afferent end is the pudendal nerve, and the efferent one is a coordinated somatic (bulbocavernous, including s2, s3 and s4 sacral segments, which result in muscle contraction) and autonomic nervous system (vaginal and clitoral cavernous autonomic nerves, resulting in clitoral, vaginal and labial enlargement).
2,3-butanedione monoxime unmasks ca(2+)-induced nadh formation and inhibits electron transport in rat hearts. the surface fluorescence of the isolated perfused rat heart has been evaluated for the purpose of nad(p)h quantitation. with the use of excitation at 340, 380, 415, and 430 nm with emission detection at 500 +/- 20 nm, the intensities at 340 and 380 nm excitation were found to be linearly related during nad(p)h oxidation/reduction induced by changes in substrate availability. changes in cardiac nad(p)h caused similar changes at 340 and 380 nm excitation, but those at 340 nm were of greater magnitude. isolated cardiac mitochondria exhibited essentially identical optical properties during changes in nad(p)h content induced by changes in substrate availability and by nad(h) oxidation/reduction caused by coupled phosphorylation of adp. the changes in redox status of both isolated mitochondria and the intact perfused heart can be expressed by a 340/380 excitation fluorescence ratio because of these relationships. this value assumed a minimum and maximum value under conditions of complete oxidation and reduction, respectively. use of this ratio in the perfused heart avoids the artifacts caused by cardiac motion and tissue stretch. removal of motion artifacts with an excitation ratio could only be accomplished if the measurements at 340 and 380 nm were estimated at the same point in the cardiac cycle. a method of cardiac waveform reconstruction and signal averaging is described to obtain these data from sequential measurements. with these techniques, the reduction of cardiac nad(p)h can be expressed as a percentage of the range obtained between minimum and maximum reduction. the described technique is of general utility in the assessment of cardiac bioenergetics.
identification of evolutionarily conserved, functional noncoding elements in the promoter region of the sodium channel gene scn8a to identify the transcriptional start sites of the neuronal channel scn8a, we carried out 5'-race (rapid amplification of cdna ends) with rna from human and mouse brain. we recovered four mutually exclusive 5'-untranslated exons (exon 1a to exon 1d) that map to a 1.8-kb region of genomic dna located approximately 70 kb upstream of the first coding exon. the same 5'-untranslated exons are expressed in central, peripheral and sympathetic nervous system and in embryonic and adult brain. a 4.8-kb genomic fragment containing these 5' exons demonstrated promoter activity in transfected mn-1 cells. in transgenic mice, transcription of the 4.8-kb promoter was restricted to brain and spinal cord. the 4.8-kb promoter contains eight consensus sp1-binding sites and two inr sites. a potential nrse/re-1 site is located nearby. two active polyadenylation sites identified by 3'-race are conserved in human, mouse, and chicken scn8a. sequence comparison of human and mouse scn8a identified 12 conserved noncoding elements whose effect on transcription was tested in transfected cells.
plastid dna variation in highly fragmented populations of microbiota decussata kom. (cupressaceae), an endemic to sikhote alin mountains plants offer excellent models to investigate how gene flow shapes the organization of genetic diversity. their three genomes can have different modes of transmission and will hence experience varying levels of gene flow. we have compiled studies of genetic structure based on chloroplast dna (cpdna), mitochondrial dna (mtdna) and nuclear markers in seed plants. based on a data set of 183 species belonging to 103 genera and 52 families, we show that the precision of estimates of genetic differentiation (gst) used to infer gene flow is mostly constrained by the sampling of populations. mode of inheritance appears to have a major effect on gst. maternally inherited genomes experience considerably more subdivision (median value of 0.67) than paternally or biparentally inherited genomes (∼0.10). gst at cpdna and mtdna markers covary narrowly when both genomes are maternally inherited, whereas gst at paternally and biparentally inherited markers also covary positively but more loosely and gst at maternally inherited markers are largely independent of values based on nuclear markers. a model‐based gross estimate suggests that, at the rangewide scale, historical levels of pollen flow are generally at least an order of magnitude larger than levels of seed flow (median of the pollen‐to‐seed migration ratio: 17) and that pollen and seed gene flow vary independently across species. finally, we show that measures of subdivision that take into account the degree of similarity between haplotypes (nst or rst) make better use of the information inherent in haplotype data than standard measures based on allele frequencies only.
aggression, impulsivity, and plasma sex hormone levels in a group of rapists, in relation to their history of childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms objective in an attempt to surmount the problem of retrospectively establishing the childhood diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the authors constructed the 61-item wender utah rating scale (wurs) for adults to use to describe their own childhood behavior. in this paper they present their initial data collection and evaluation of the instrument's validity.   method the scale was administered to 81 adult outpatients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 100 "normal" adults, and 70 psychiatric adult outpatients with unipolar depression. the authors analyzed data from the 25 items of the scale that showed the greatest difference between the patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the normal comparison subjects and the relationship between the wurs and the patients' parents' judgment of childhood activity as measured by the parents' rating scale.   results the patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder had significantly higher mean scores on all 25 items than did the two comparison groups. the difference between the mean total scores of the patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the normal subjects was also highly significant. a cutoff score of 46 or higher correctly identified 86% of the patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 99% of the normal subjects, and 81% of the depressed subjects. correlations obtained between wurs scores and parents' rating scale scores were moderate but impressive. the ability of wurs scores to predict response to methylphenidate replicated the authors' finding regarding the ability of parents' rating scale scores to predict response to pemoline.   conclusions the wurs is sensitive in identifying childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and may be useful in recognizing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in patients with ambiguous adult psychopathology.
fine-grained object recognition in underwater visual data to build a detailed knowledge of the biodiversity, the geographical distribution and the evolution of the alive species is essential for a sustainable development and the preservation of this biodiversity. massive databases of underwater video surveillance have been recently made available for supporting designing algorithms targeting the identification of fishes. however these video datasets are rather poor in terms of video resolution, pretty challenging regarding both the natural phenomena to be considered such as murky water, seaweed moving the water current, etc, and the huge amount of data to be processed. we have designed a processing chain based on background segmentation, selection keypoints with an adaptive scale, description with opponentsift and learning of each species by a binary linear support vector machines classifier.  our algorithm has been evaluated in the context of our participation to the fish task of the lifeclef2014 challenge. compared to the baseline designed by the lifeclef challenge organizers, our approach reaches a better precision but a worse recall. our performances in terms of species recognition (based only on the correctly detected bounding boxes) is comparable to the baseline, but our bounding boxes are often too large and our score is so penalized. our results are thus really encouraging.
is nocturnal eating in restless legs syndrome linked to a specific psychopathological profile? a pilot study abstract a simple questionnaire was developed as an instrument for assessing the existence and extent of different obsessional-compulsive complaints. two major types of complaint, checking and washing compulsions, and two minor types, slowness and doubting, were established. the final form of the questionnaire, and major properties, are presented.
weakly supervised 3d reconstruction with adversarial constraint inspired by the recent success of methods that employ shape priors to achieve robust 3d reconstructions, we propose a novel recurrent neural network architecture that we call the 3d recurrent reconstruction neural network (3d-r2n2). the network learns a mapping from images of objects to their underlying 3d shapes from a large collection of synthetic data [13]. our network takes in one or more images of an object instance from arbitrary viewpoints and outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3d occupancy grid. unlike most of the previous works, our network does not require any image annotations or object class labels for training or testing. our extensive experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for single view reconstruction, and (ii) enables the 3d reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional sfm/slam methods fail (because of lack of texture and/or wide baseline).
dynamic model selection for prediction under a budget tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. in this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called xgboost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. we propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. more importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. by combining these insights, xgboost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.
long-term actuarial survivorship analysis of an interspinous stabilization system the use of survivorship analysis requires an assumption that patients who are lost to follow-up are no more or less likely to be at risk of failure of an operation or a procedure than are patients who are still being followed. this is a major assumption in long-term orthopaedic studies, in which a high percentage of patients are usually lost to follow-up. we compared the survivorship curve for the first 100 tharies replacements done at our institution (which were completed by september 1977), using data that were collected in the standard way up to 1985, through a letter requesting a follow-up visit, with the curve for the same patients that was based on almost complete follow-up data that were gathered by telephone from 1985 on. the similarity of the two curves suggested that the assumptions that are necessary for the validity of survivorship analysis are reasonable, even in the orthopaedic setting, in which many patients are lost to follow-up. the usefulness of the survivorship curve for prediction was also evaluated by comparing the curve based on the first forty-six of the 100 tharies replacements (before 1977) with the curve based on the last fifty-four such operations (from january 1977 to september 1977). the results of these two comparisons suggest that survivorship analysis is a valid technique to use in the long-term evaluation of patients who have had a joint replacement.
in vitro fermentation of different fructo-oligosaccharides by bifidobacterium strains for the selection of synbiotic combinations. the effects of dietary short chain fructooligosaccharides (scfos) incorporation on hematology, fish immune status, gut microbiota composition, digestive enzymes activities, and gut morphology, was evaluated in gilthead sea bream (sparus aurata) juveniles reared at 18 °c and 25 °c. for that purpose, fish with 32 g were fed diets including 0, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5% scfos during 8 weeks. overall, scfos had only minor effects on gilthead sea bream immune status. lymphocytes decreased in fish fed the 0.1% scfos diet. fish fed the 0.5% scfos diet presented increased nitric oxide (no) production, while total immunoglobulins (ig) dropped in those fish, but only in the ones reared at 25 °c. red blood cells, hemoglobin, bactericidal activity and no were higher at 25 °c, whereas total white blood cells, circulating thrombocytes, monocytes and neutrophils were higher at 18 °c. in fish fed scfos, lymphocytes were higher at 18 °c. total ig were also higher at 18 °c but only in fish fed 0.1% and 0.5% scfos diets. no differences in gut bacterial profiles were detected by pcr-dgge (polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) between dietary treatments. however, group's similarity was higher at 25 °c. digestive enzymes activities were higher at 25 °c but were unaffected by prebiotics incorporation. gut morphology was also unaffected by dietary prebiotic incorporation. overall, gut microbiota composition, digestive enzymes activities and immunity parameters were affected by rearing temperature whereas dietary scfos incorporation had only minor effects on these parameters. in conclusion, at the tested levels scfos does not seem worthy of including it in gilthead sea bream juveniles diets.
extreme-scale stochastic particle tracing for uncertain unsteady flow visualization and analysis the objective of this paper is to understand transport behavior in uncertain time-varying flow fields by redefining the finite-time lyapunov exponent (ftle) and lagrangian coherent structure (lcs) as stochastic counterparts of their traditional deterministic definitions. three new concepts are introduced: the distribution of the ftle (d-ftle), the ftle of distributions (ftle-d), and uncertain lcs (u-lcs). the d-ftle is the probability density function of ftle values for every spatiotemporal location, which can be visualized with different statistical measurements. the ftle-d extends the deterministic ftle by measuring the divergence of particle distributions. it gives a statistical overview of how transport behaviors vary in neighborhood locations. the u-lcs, the probabilities of finding lcss over the domain, can be extracted with stochastic ridge finding and density estimation algorithms. we show that our approach produces better results than existing variance-based methods do. our experiments also show that the combination of d-ftle, ftle-d, and u-lcs can help users understand transport behaviors and find separatrices in ensemble simulations of atmospheric processes.
neural basis of postural instability identified by vtc and eeg this study investigated the hypothesis that virtual time-to-contact, which specifies the time to reach the functional stability boundary, is a variable controlled in the maintenance of upright posture. three different levels of support surface compliance were used on a force platform (no foam, 5 cm of foam, and 15 cm of foam). the participant’s task was to stand still under each surface support condition both with and without vision. the stability boundary was determined for each set of conditions where the participant was required to lean as far as possible in all directions of the horizontal plane without losing stability. the results showed that the no vision conditions had a significantly larger center of pressure displacement than the vision conditions. no vision and increasing support surface compliance also increased the velocity of the center of pressure trajectory. the distribution of the radial displacement of the center of pressure showed relatively equal frequency over spatial location with no central tendency. the virtual time-to-contact with the stability boundary decreased as platform surface support became more compliant. furthermore, the distribution of virtual time over the effective scaling range was a power law with a larger exponent in the more unstable no vision and increasing surface foam conditions. the findings provide additional evidence for the hypothesis that virtual time-to-contact with stability boundaries is a postural control variable that is regulated rather than the preservation of minimal motion around the center of the stability region as proposed in pendulum models of posture.
production of clonal planting materials from gracilaria changii and kappaphycus alvarezii through tissue culture and culture of g. changii explants in airlift photobioreactors there have been limited reports on molecular sex markers for macroalgae. we report the use of random amplified polymorphic dna analysis (rapd) to identify molecular sex markers for gracilaria changii (xia et abbott) abbott, zhang et xia. two dna extraction methods were used: a modified ctab and phenol-chloroform combination method and the dneasy plant mini kit. the ctab and phenol-chloroform method gave the best yield of dna in quality and quantity and is suitable for larger-sized specimens like g. changii. sixty-nine rapd primers were screened to search for sex-linked dna markers for g. changii, and only one sex-linked marker (716 bp) was identified using opa 18. rapd was also used to investigate the molecular characteristics of the three life-stages (male, female, tetrasporophyte) of g. changii. seven (opa7, opa18, s14, s61, s64, s75 and s76) out of the 69 primers showed polymorphism and were selected for interpopulation analysis for dna isolated from 23 samples collected from morib and sungai pulai in malaysia. the combination of data produced by the seven primers generated a dendrogram that grouped the specimens into different clades according to their sex and life-stage using the unweighted pair group and arithmetic averages (upgma) method. it showed that rapd was able to differentiate tetrasporophytes, females, and males.
critical analysis of consecutive unilateral cleft lip repairs: determining ideal sample size the outcomes of a consecutive series of 10 adults who had unilateral cleft lip and palate and who had undergone le fort i advancement fixed with miniplates were investigated. the amount and timing of horizontal and vertical relapse, the correlation between advancement and relapse, and the effectiveness of various methods of internal fixation were analyzed with respect to the authors' clinical experience and the data from the international literature. tracings of the preoperative and serial postoperative lateral cephalograms--taken immediately and during the 1 1/2 to 2 postoperative years--were analyzed to calculate horizontal and vertical maxillary change. we found that the use of rigid fixation is associated with a significantly more stable postoperative result, as described by other authors. our study suggests that this useful technique does not eliminate but reduces and controls the problem of relapse in a series of unilateral cleft lip and palate adult patients undergoing le fort i osteotomy.
modeling redundancy-based routing in delay tolerant networks intermittently connected mobile networks are wireless networks where most of the time there does not exist a complete path from the source to the destination. there are many real networks that fall into this paradigm, for example, wildlife tracking sensor networks, military networks, inter-planetary networks, etc. in this context, conventional routing schemes would fail. to deal with such networks researchers have suggested to use flooding-based routing schemes. while floodingbased schemes have a high probability of delivery, they waste a lot of energy and suffer from severe contention which can significantly degrade their performance. with this in mind, we introduce a new routing scheme, called spray and wait, that “sprays” a number of copies into the network, and then “waits” till one of these nodes meets the destination. we compare this scheme to a number of different routing algorithms including an oracle-based optimal algorithm that minimizes average message delivery delay while using the lowest possible number of transmissions. theory and simulations show that spray and wait has a number of desirable properties: it is very simple to implement, it is highly scalable, it performs close to the optimal scheme, and quite surprisingly, it outperforms all existing schemes with respect to both average message delivery delay and number of transmissions per message delivered.
mri findings reveal three different types of tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex background patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and drug-resistant epilepsy may be considered candidates for epilepsy surgery. this demands the unambiguous demonstration of the epileptogenicity of one of the tubers.   objective to test whether diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging enables differentiation of epileptogenic tubers from inert ones.   methods in 4 patients with clear unifocal interictal spike activity, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were performed. apparent diffusion coefficient maps were calculated in the identified epileptogenic tuber and compared withthose in nonepileptogenic tubers and regions of normal-appearing cortex.   results a significant increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient was found in the epileptogenic tubers. furthermore, the apparent diffusion coefficient of the nonepileptogenic tubers was significantly higher than the trace apparent diffusion coefficient of regions of normal-appearing cortex.   conclusion diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging may be of clinical importance for the identification of epileptogenic tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis and intractable epilepsy.
a modified partial product generator for redundant binary multipliers an algorithm to convert redundant number representations into conventional representations is presented. the algorithm is performed concurrently with the digit-by-digit generation of redundant forms by schemes such as srt division. it has a step delay roughly equivalent to the delay of a carry-save adder and simple implementation. the conversion scheme is applicable in arithmetic algorithms such as nonrestoring division, square root, and on-line operations in which redundantly represented results are generated in a digit-by-digit manner, from most significant to least significant.
evidence for source–sink dynamics in a regional population of arctic ground squirrels (urocitellus parryii plesius) nous avons etudie les sousliks arctiques (urocitellus parryii plesius (osgood, 1900); anterieurement spermophilus parryii plesius osgood, 1900) dans trois types d'habitat distincts (la foret boreale, les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines) dans la region de kluane dans le sud-ouest du territoire du yukon, canada, de 2008 a 2010, afin de determiner si les populations de ces differents habitats presentaient des repartitions et des abondances specifiques aux habitats. on a demontre que leur abondance dans la foret boreale est synchronisee avec le cycle des lievres d'amerique (lepus americanus erxleben, 1777) dans la region a cause de leurs predateurs communs. nous avons predit que les populations dans la foret boreale devraient etre basses a cause du minimum actuel dans le cycle des lievres d'amerique, mais que les sousliks devraient etre relativement abondants dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines. les densites en fin d'ete differaient significativement entre les divers types d'habitats, avec 0,38 ± 0.13 souslik/ha (moyenne ± 1 es) dans l'habitat de foret boreale, 1,25 ± 0,22 souslik/ha dans l'habitat de prairie basse et 5,7 ± 0,22 sousliks/ha dans l'habitat de prairie alpine. en 2009, les populations ont ete extirpees de l'habitat de foret boreale, alors que les densites dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines etaient respectivement de 1,6 ± 0,34 souslik/ha et de 6,1 ± 0,7 sousliks/ha. l'absence actuelle de sousliks dans la foret boreale et la persistance des populations dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines laissent croire a l'existence d'une dynamique de type source-puits entre les types d'habitats de foret boreale et de prairie.
genetic analysis of two japanese patients with non-classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency. we determined the sequence of a mutant cyp21b gene isolated from a patient with the severe, "salt-wasting" form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency. codon 318 in this gene is changed from cag, encoding glutamine, to tag, a nonsense codon. this is predicted to result in a completely nonfunctional enzyme due to premature termination of translation. in addition, when the cloned mutant gene was transfected into mouse y1 adrenal cells, the resulting mrna levels were decreased compared with transfected normal cyp21b genes. this mutation was carried by 3 of 20 unrelated patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency alleles as determined by hybridization with a specific oligonucleotide probe. this mutation is also seen in the normal cyp21a pseudogene, so that its presence in the abnormal cyp21b gene may be the result of a gene conversion event.
a unified deep artificial neural network approach to partial differential equations in complex geometries we study a new algorithm for solving parabolic partial differential equations (pdes) and backward stochastic differential equations (bsdes) in high dimension, which is based on an analogy between the bsde and reinforcement learning with the gradient of the solution playing the role of the policy function, and the loss function given by the error between the prescribed terminal condition and the solution of the bsde. the policy function is then approximated by a neural network, as is done in deep reinforcement learning. numerical results using tensorflow illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the studied algorithm for several 100-dimensional nonlinear pdes from physics and finance such as the allen–cahn equation, the hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation, and a nonlinear pricing model for financial derivatives.
bdnf variants influence educational attainment but not disease characteristics in alzheimers disease a functional polymorphism in the coding region of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) gene (196 a/g, met66val) has recently been reported to be associated with alzheimer's disease (ad) and with an overrepresentation of g allele in ad patients, but different results have also been presented. we conducted a case-control study to analyze the association between the bdnf a/g polymorphism and sporadic ad in a sample composed of 203 ad patients and 239 controls from mainland chinese han population. no association between the polymorphism and ad, no association between the polymorphism and age at onset in ad, and no significant interaction between bdnf and apolipoprotein e (apoe) genotype were detected in either the total or the male samples. however, a significantly high frequency of the gg genotype in the female controls compared with the female patients was detected. a postponed age at onset in the female patients with the gg genotype was also observed. these results suggest that the gg genotype has a protection effect from ad development in females. a significant low frequency of ad patients with the bdnf gg genotype in the ad apoeepsilon4 carriers compared with the frequency of the controls with the bdnf gg genotype in the control apoeepsilon4 carriers was also detected in the female individuals, suggesting that the bdnf gg genotype may reduce the effect of apoeepsilon4 on ad risk in females. additionally, low frequencies of bdnf g allele and gg genotype were revealed in chinese when compared with that in the other race populations so far reported.
polyanalgesic consensus conference—2012: recommendations to reduce morbidity and mortality in intrathecal drug delivery in the treatment of chronic pain objectives:the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intrathecal narcotics pump (itnp) as an alternative treatment for patients with pain from chronic pancreatitis (cp). itnp offers the advantages of reversibility, lower total narcotic dose, and the pancreas remaining intact.methods:thirteen patients (8 female, 5 male), with mean age 40.6 years (s.d. 9.6 years), who had experienced intractable upper abdominal pain from cp were reviewed. each patient had multiple other failed treatment modalities, including partial pancreatic resection (n=6). they were offered itnp after a successful intraspinal opioid trial. etiologies of cp included idiopathy (n=3), cystic fibrosis (n=2), alcohol (n=2), and pancreas divisum (n=6).results:the median duration of severe, intractable pain prior to itnp was 6 years (2–22 years). the median follow-up time after itnp was 29 months (range, 7–94 months). the itnp was in situ for a mean duration of 29 months (range, 0.5–94 months). seven patients had pump exchange or removal for various reasons; improvement of pain at month 53 (n=1), meningitis (n=1), meningitis with subsequent replacement (n=1), pump failure at month 31, 68, 79, and 84 (n=4). there were no deaths. the mean pain score prior to implantation (score=8.3, s.d.=0.9) was significantly higher than 1 year after (score=2.7, s.d.=1.9) (p<0.01) and last follow-up (score=0.75, s.d.=2.1) (p<0.01). the median oral narcotic dose before and 1 year after itnp were morphine sulfate equivalents 337.5 mg per day (range, 67.5–1,320) and 40 mg per day (range, 0–1,680), respectively (p<0.01). two patients were considered failures, as they still require a high dosage of both oral and intrathecal medications to control their pain, despite significant pain-score improvement. one patient who was excluded due to meningitis was also considered a failure. therefore, the overall success rate of itnp based on an intention-to-treat analysis was 76.9% (10/13). the major complications of itnp were central nervous system infection requiring pump removal (n=1), cerebrospinal fluid leak requiring laminectomy (n=1), and perispinal abscess with bacterial meningitis requiring pump removal (n=1).conclusions:this study shows the many risks and benefits of itnp. a longer follow-up is awaited; such pumps appear to be one alternative to aggressive surgical intervention. failed itnp trials leave other options open. therapeutic trials directly comparing pancreatectomy, itnp, and implanted nerve stimulators are of interest.
sex‐specific activation of sk current by isoproterenol facilitates action potential triangulation and arrhythmogenesis in rabbit ventricles a mathematical model of a small conductance ca2+‐activated potassium (sk) channel was developed and incorporated into a physiologically detailed ventricular myocyte model. ca2+‐sensitive k+ currents promote negative intracellular ca2+ to membrane voltage (cai2+→ vm) coupling. increase of ca2+‐sensitive k+ currents can be responsible for electromechanically discordant alternans and quasiperiodic oscillations at the cellular level. at the tissue level, turing‐type instability can occur when ca2+‐sensitive k+ currents are increased.
evaluation of trunk muscle activity in chronic low back pain patients and healthy individuals during holding loads. stability of the lumbar spine is an important factor in determining spinal response to sudden loading. using two different methods, this study evaluated how various trunk load magnitudes and directions affect lumbar spine stability. the first method was a quick release procedure in which effective trunk stiffness and stability were calculated from trunk kinematic response to a resisted-force release. the second method combined trunk muscle emg data with a biomechanical model to calculate lumbar spine stability. twelve subjects were tested in trunk flexion, extension, and lateral bending under nine permutations of vertical and horizontal trunk loading. the vertical load values were set at 0, 20, and 40% of the subject's body weight (bw). the horizontal loads were 0, 10, and 20% of bw. effective spine stability as obtained from quick release experimentation increased significantly (p<0.01) with increased vertical and horizontal loading. it ranged from 785 (s.d.=580) nm/rad under no-load conditions to 2200 (s.d.=1015) nm/rad when the maximum horizontal and vertical loads were applied to the trunk simultaneously. stability of the lumbar spine achieved prior to force release and estimated from the biomechanical model explained approximately 50% of variance in the effective spine stability obtained from quick release trials in extension and lateral bending (0.53<r(2)<0.63). there was no such correlation in flexion trials. it was concluded that lumbar spine stability increased with increased trunk load magnitude to the extent that this load brought about an increase in trunk muscle activation. indirectly, our data suggest that muscle reflex response to sudden loading can augment the lumbar spine stability level achieved immediately prior to the sudden loading event.
human disturbance reduces genetic diversity of an endangered tropical tree, prunus africana (rosaceae) i reexamine the use of isolation by distance models as a basis for the estimation of demographic parameters from measures of population subdivision. to that aim, i first provide results for values of f-statistics in one-dimensional models and coalescence times in two-dimensional models, and make more precise earlier results for f-statistics in two-dimensional models and coalescence times in one-dimensional models. based on these results, i propose a method of data analysis involving the regression of fst/(1-fst) estimates for pairs of subpopulations on geographic distance for populations along linear habitats or logarithm of distance for populations in two-dimensional habitats. this regression provides in principle an estimate of the product of population density and second moment of parental axial distance. in two cases where comparison to direct estimates is possible, the method proposed here is more satisfactory than previous indirect methods.
polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (ptb) and ptb-associated splicing factor in cvb3 infection: an itaf for an itaf poliovirus protease 2a (2apro) obstructs host gene expression by reprogramming transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory events during infection. here we demonstrate that expression of 2apro induces a selective nucleo-cytoplasm translocation of several important rna binding proteins and splicing factors. subcellular fractionation studies, together with immunofluorescence microscopy revealed an asymmetric distribution of hur and tia1/tiar in 2apro expressing cells, which modulates splicing of the human fas exon 6. consistent with this result, knockdown of hur or overexpression of tia1/tiar, leads to fas exon 6 inclusion in 2apro-expressing cells. therefore, poliovirus 2apro can target alternative pre-mrna splicing by regulating protein shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
evaluation of biotechnology-derived novel proteins for the risk of food-allergic potential: advances in the development of animal models and future challenges discredited a few years ago, active suppression is now commonly considered as a key mechanism avoiding auto-reactivity and development of potentially harmful immune responses, and in some circumstances, as an obstacle to successful vaccination. a large quantity of literature identifies naturally occurring cd4+cd25+ t cells as key suppressor cells involved in the control of many pathophysiological diseases. manipulation of these cells and control of their function offers new perspectives for the treatment of auto-immune and inflammatory diseases and enhancement of vaccine efficacy. such clinical interventions require a better understanding of the conditions of expansion/activation of cd4+cd25+ t cells and deciphering of their mechanism of suppression, which remains incomplete and sometimes controversial.
training skills of divided attention among older adults the authors examined the effects of divided attention (da) at encoding and retrieval in free recall, cued recall, and recognition memory in 4 experiments. lists of words or word pairs were presented auditorily and recalled orally; the secondary task was a visual continuous reaction-time (rt) task with manual responses. at encoding, da was associated with large reductions in memory performance, but small increases in rt; trade-offs between memory and rt were under conscious control. in contrast, da at retrieval resulted in small or no reductions in memory, but in comparatively larger increases in rt, especially in free recall. memory performance was sensitive to changes in task emphasis at encoding but not at retrieval. the results are discussed in terms of controlled and automatic processes and speculatively linked to underlying neuropsychological mechanisms.
neural correlates of gentle skin stroking in early infancy the multimodal properties of the human somatosensory system continue to be unravelled. there is mounting evidence that one of these submodalities-touch-has another dimension, providing not only its well-recognized discriminative input to the brain, but also an affective input. it has long been recognized that touch plays an important role in many forms of social communication and a number of theories have been proposed to explain observations and beliefs about the "power of touch." here, we propose that a class of low-threshold mechanosensitive c fibers that innervate the hairy skin represent the neurobiological substrate for the affective and rewarding properties of touch.
prediction and rate of infections in diabetes mellitus patients with diabetes ketoacidosis in penang, malaysia diabetic ketoacidosis (dka) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (tidm). mortality is predominantly related to the occurrence of cerebral oedema; only a minority of deaths in dka are attributed to other causes. cerebral oedema occurs in about 0.3–1% of all episodes of dka, and its aetiology, pathophysiology, and ideal method of treatment are poorly understood. there is debate as to whether physicians treating dka can prevent or predict the occurrence of cerebral oedema, and the appropriate site(s) for children with dka to be managed. there is agreement that prevention of dka and reduction of its incidence should be a goal in managing children with diabetes.
on the development of kinetic models for solvent-free benzyl alcohol oxidation over a gold-palladium catalyst in the solvent free oxidation of benzyl alcohol, using supported gold-palladium nanoalloys, toluene is often one of major by-products and it is formed by the disproportionation of benzyl alcohol. gold-palladium catalysts on acidic supports promote both the disproportionation of benzyl alcohol and oxidative dehydrogenation to form benzaldehyde. basic supports completely switch off disproportionation and the gold-palladium nanoparticles catalyse the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction exclusively. in an attempt to provide further details on the course of these reactions, we have utilized in situ atr-ir, in situ drift and inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopic methods, and in this article we present the results of these in situ spectroscopic studies.
effect of retro and forward walking on quadriceps muscle strength, pain, function, and mobility in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a protocol for a randomized controlled trial background: increased external knee adduction moment during walking alters the joint biomechanics; which causes symptoms in chronic knee osteoarthritis patients. aims: to assess additional effects of retro-walking over conventional treatment on pain and disability in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic knee osteoarthritis. materials and methods: thirty chronic knee osteoarthritis patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups. group ‘a’ (7 men, 8 women) received conventional treatment. group ‘b’ (8 men, 7 women) received conventional treatment and retro-walking. pain, assessed through visual analogue scale (vas), and western ontario and mcmaster universities arthritis index (womac) were the primary outcomes and knee range of motion (rom), hip abductor and extensor strength were secondary outcomes; measured pre-intervention, after 1 week and after 3 weeks of intervention. results: two factors analysis of variance for repeated measures was used for all outcomes. at the end of 3 weeks; womac score showed highly significant difference within (p < 0.0001) and significant difference between groups (p = 0.040) also by time × group interaction (p = 0.024), vas showed highly significant difference within groups (p < 0.0001). knee rom showed significant difference within groups. hip abductor and extensor strength showed significant difference by time × group interaction (p < 0.05). conclusion: retrowalking is an effective adjunct to conventional treatment in decreasing disability in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
recent duplication and inter-locus gene conversion in major histocompatibility class ii genes in a teleost, the three-spined stickleback we have tested the importance of genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class iib in atlantic salmon (salmo salar) for survival after challenge with a highly virulent bacterial pathogen. forty juvenile full siblings from each of 120 families were infected with the bacterium aeromonas salmonicida, which causes high mortality in salmon due to furunculosis. fishes from high–resistance (hr, < 35% mortality) and low–resistance (lr, > 80% mortality) families were screened for their mhc class iib genotypes using the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) technique. the exon 2 sequences, encoding the major part of the peptide–binding region, were established for each dgge fragment. one allele, e, containing a missense single base substitution was significantly more prevalent in hr families than in lr families. an odds–ratio test showed that broods carrying this allele had a 12–fold higher chance of being hr than broods without the e allele. a second allele, i, showed significantly higher frequencies in uninfected and surviving individuals than in infected dead individuals. a third allele, j, tended to be more prevalent both in lr families and in individuals that had died of the infection. there was no correlation between mhc heterozygosity and resistance to a. salmonicida. our results support the hypothesis that mhc polymorphism is maintained through pathogen–driven selection acting by means of frequency–dependent selection rather than heterozygous advantage.
efficiency of transcriptional gene silencing of gbssi in potato depends on the promoter region that is used in an inverted repeat two distinct gene-silencing phenomena are observed in plants: transcriptional gene silencing (tgs), which involves decreased rna synthesis because of promoter methylation, and posttranscriptional gene silencing (ptgs), which involves sequence-specific rna degradation. ptgs is induced by deliberate [1-4] or fortuitous production (r.v.b., unpublished data) of double-stranded rna (dsrna). tgs could be the result of dna pairing [5], but could also be the result of dsrna, as was shown by the dsrna-induced inactivation of a transgenic promoter [6]. here, we show that when targeting flower pigmentation genes in petunia, transgenes expressing dsrna can induce ptgs when coding sequences are used and tgs when promoter sequences are taken. for both types of silencing, small rna species are found, which are thought to be dsrna decay products [7] and determine the sequence specificity of the silencing process [8, 9]. furthermore, silencing is accompanied by the methylation of dna sequences that are homologous to dsrna. dna methylation is assumed to be essential for regulating tgs and important for reinforcing ptgs [10]. therefore, we conclude that tgs and ptgs are mechanistically related. in addition, we show that dsrna-induced tgs provides an efficient tool to generate gene knockouts, because not only does the tgs of a ptgs-inducing transgene fully revert the ptgs phenotype, but also an endogenous gene can be transcriptionally silenced by dsrna corresponding to its promoter.
retrograde dynamic locked nailing for valgus knee correction: a revised technique twenty-one patients with lateral compartment osteoarthritis and valgus deformity of the knee underwent distal femoral supracondylar osteotomy (medial closing wedge) between 1983 and 1993 with follow-up ranging from 1 to 8 years. ten knees had plaster cast immobilization, 5 had fixation with 2 staples supplemented with a plaster cast, and 6 knees had rigid internal fixation with an ao blade plate. thirty-three percent of patients had a satisfactory result using the hss score, and 57% had a satisfactory result using the knee society clinical rating. fifty-seven percent had a significant complication, including severe knee stiffness requiring manipulation under anesthesia (48%), nonunion/delayed union (19%), infection (10%), and fixation failure (5%). five (19%) knees required total knee replacement within 5 years of surgery. satisfactory results were obtained only in those patients who had less severe degrees of osteoarthritis confined to the lateral compartment (grades i to iii), adequate correction of valgus deformity (the anatomical axis within 2 degrees from zero), and rigid internal fixation to permit postoperative early mobilization. these results indicate that distal femoral osteotomy is a satisfactory procedure in the young, active patient with osteoarthritis of the lateral compartment of the knee, but requires precise surgical technique and rigid internal fixation.
epidemiology and socioeconomic impact of seasonal affective disorder in austria. backgroundan interview format version of the sheehan disability scale (sds) modified to assess gambling treatment outcomes was assessed for reliability and validity. the sds assesses impairment in work, family and social functioning related to mental disorders.methodsa pilot study (n = 21) determined the preferred wording for oral administration. participants with pathological gambling in a relapse prevention clinical trial completed the scale and other validation measures at baseline, six and twelve month follow-ups (n = 169).resultsconfirmatory factor analysis supported a one factor solution and the scale had good internal reliability for a three item scale. the sds was sensitive to change and correlations with recent gambling behaviour and severity were moderate as expected. similarly, correlations with self-efficacy, perceived control over gambling, and craving were moderate, but they were lower for less directly related constructs such as depression and perceived family and friend support.conclusionsthe sds is a brief, psychometrically sound, outcome measure of impairment associated with gambling disorders that can be administered by telephone.
tlr4-mediated expression of mac-1 in monocytes plays a pivotal role in monocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium platelets are essential for primary hemostasis, but they also play an important pro-inflammatory role. platelets normally circulate in a quiescent state. upon activation, platelets can secrete and present various molecules, change their shape as well as the expression pattern of adhesion molecules. these changes are associated with the adhesion of platelets to leukocytes and the vessel wall. the interaction of platelets with neutrophils promotes the recruitment of neutrophils into inflammatory tissue and thus participates in host defense. this interaction of neutrophils with platelets is mainly mediated through p-selectin and beta(2) and beta(3) integrins (cd11b/cd18, cd41/cd61). platelets can also interact with endothelial cells and monocytes. adherent platelets promote the 'secondary capture' of neutrophils and other leukocytes. in addition, platelets secrete neutrophil and endothelial activators inducing production of inflammatory cytokines. thus, platelets are important amplifiers of acute inflammation.
smt3/sumo and ubc9 are required for efficient apc/c‐mediated proteolysis in budding yeast cell cycle progression in eukaryotes is controlled by the p34cdc21cdc28 protein kinase and its short-lived, phase-specific regulatory subunits called cyclins1,2. in xenopus oocytes, degradation of m-phase (b-type) cyclins is required for exit from mitosis and is mediated by the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system3. here we show that b-type-cyclin degradation in yeast involves an essential nuclear ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, ubc9. repression of ubc9 synthesis prevents cell cycle progression at the g2 or early m phase, causing the accumulation of large budded cells with a single nucleus, a short spindle and replicated dna. in ubc9 mutants both clb5, an s-phase cyclin4,5, and clb2, an m-phase cyclin6,7, are stabilized. in wild-type cells the clb5 protein is unstable throughout the cell cycle, whereas clb2 turnover occurs only at a specific cell-cycle stage8. thus distinct degradation signals or regulated interaction with the ubiquitin-protein ligase system may determine the cell-cycle specificity of cyclin proteolysi
quantitative characterization of functional anatomical contributions to cognitive control under uncertainty tasks involving conflict between stimulus dimensions have been shown to activate dorsal anterior cingulate and prefrontal areas. it has been proposed that the dorsal anterior cingulate is involved a domain general process of monitoring conflict, while prefrontal areas are involved in resolving conflict. we examine three tasks that all require people to respond based on one stimulus dimension while ignoring another conflicting dimension, but which vary in the source of conflict. one of the tasks uses language stimuli (stroop effect) and two use nonlanguage spatial conflicts appropriate for children and nonhuman animals. in experiment 1, 12 participants were studied with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) while performing each of the three tasks. reaction times for each of the three tasks were significantly longer in the incongruent condition compared with the congruent condition, demonstrating that each task elicits a conflict. by studying the same people in the same session, we test the hypothesis that conflict activates a similar brain network in the three tasks. significant activations were found in the anterior cingulate and left prefrontal cortex for all three conflict tasks. within these regions, the conflict component demonstrated evidence for significant common activation across the three tasks, although the peak activation point and spatial extent were not identical. other areas demonstrated activation unique to each task. experiments 2-4 provide behavioral evidence indicating considerable independence between conflict operations involved in the tasks. the behavioral and fmri results taken together seem to argue against a single unified network for processing conflict, but instead support either distinct networks for each conflict task or a single network that monitors conflict with different sites used to resolve the conflict.
boundary ground ring in minimal string theory the correspondence claimed by douglas between the multicritical regimes of the two-matrix model and 2d gravity coupled with (p,q) rational matter field, is worked out explicity. we found the minimal (p,q) multicritical potentials u(x) and v(y), which are polynomials of degree p and q, correspondingly. the loop averages w(x) and w(y) are shown to satisfy the heisenberg relations {w, x} = 1 and {w, y} = 1 essentially coincide with the canonical momenta p and q. the operators x and y create the two kinds of boundaries in the (p,q) model related by the duality (p,q) ↔ (q,p). finally, we present a closed expression for the two two-loop correlators, and interpret its scaling limit.
exploiting partial reconfiguration through pcie for a microphone array network emulator the use of microphone arrays for sound-source localization is a well-researched topic. the response of such sensor arrays is dependent on the quantity of microphones operating on the array. a higher number of microphones, however, increase the computational demand, making real-time response challenging. in this paper, we present a filter-and-sum based architecture and several acceleration techniques to provide accurate sound-source localization in real-time. experiments demonstrate how an accurate sound-source localization is obtained in a couple of milliseconds, independently of the number of microphones. finally, we also propose different strategies to further accelerate the sound-source localization while offering increased angular resolution.
euroqol eq-5d and condition-specific measures of health outcome in women with urinary incontinence: reliability, validity and responsiveness objectives to report on the further development of the incontinence quality of life instrument (i-qol), a self-report quality of life measure specific to urinary incontinence (ui), including its measurement model, responsiveness, and effect size.   methods incontinent female patients (141 with stress, 147 with mixed ui) completed the i-qol and comparative measures at screening, pretreatment, and four subsequent follow-up visits during participation in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial assessing the efficacy of duloxetine. psychometric testing followed standardized procedures.   results factor analysis confirmed an overall score and three subscale scores (avoidance and limiting behaviors, psychosocial impacts, and social embarrassment). all scores were internally consistent (alpha = 0.87 to 0.93) and reproducible (icc = 0.87 to 0.91). the pattern of previously reported correlations with the short-form 36-item health survey and psychological well-being schedule were confirmed. responsiveness statistics using changes in the independent measures of stress test pad weight, number of incontinent episodes, and patient global impression of improvement ranged from 0.4 to 0.8. minimally important changes ranged from 2% to 5% in association with these measures and effect sizes.   conclusions in a clinical trial, the i-qol proved to be valid, reproducible, and responsive to treatment for ui in women.
inhalation toxicokinetics of p-dichlorobenzene and daily absorption and internal accumulation in chronic low-level exposure to humans the biotransformation and kinetics of 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-dcb) were studied in male wistar rats at three oral dose levels (10, 50 and 250 mg/kg). the effect of induction of cyp2e1 by isoniazid on the kinetics and biotransformation was determined. excretion was predominantly via the urine (78-85%) and to a small extent via the faeces (2-5%). the relative contributions of these routes were not dose dependent. excretion via the bile ranged from less than 5% at the low dose level to 30% at the high dose level. the major biliary metabolite was the glucuronide of 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-dcp). the time point at which the plasma concentrations of the parent compound and the metabolites were maximal (tcmax) as well as the maximum concentrations (cmax) increased with higher dose level. induction by isoniazid resulted in a faster urinary elimination, whereas tcmax and cmax were lower for induced rats. in addition, the area under the blood curve (auc) was smaller and total clearance was higher for induced rats. 1,4-dcb was mainly metabolized to 2,5-dcp (ca. 90%), which was detected in the urine as its sulfate (50-60%), glucuronide (20-30%) and the free form (5-10%). minor metabolites were the n-acetyl-cysteine-s-dihydro-hydroxy-1,4-dichlorobenzene and the corresponding dehydrated n-acetyl-cysteine-s-1,4-dichlorobenzene, which comprised ca. 10% of total metabolites. no hydroquinones were observed for the male wistar rat, not even under conditions of induced oxidative metabolism.
follicular thyroid carcinoma invades venous rather than lymphatic vessels we retrospectively analyzed the outcome of all patients who received their primary treatment for follicular thyroid cancer at the mayo clinic between 1946 and 1970. the diagnosis was confirmed by reexamination of preserved tissue specimens. the 57 female and 43 male patients (mean age, 53 years) underwent follow-up for a maximum of 32 years (mean, 17.4 years). all patients were treated surgically, and total removal of primary tumor was thought to have been accomplished in all but three. only 2 of the 88 patients without distant metastatic lesions at the time of initial diagnosis underwent ablation of the thyroid remnant. at the conclusion of the study, 52 patients had died, thyroid cancer being the cause of death in 19. on the basis of univariate survival analysis, age more than 50 years, tumor size that exceeded 3.9 cm, higher tumor grade, presence of marked vascular invasion, adjacent tissue invasion, and distant metastatic involvement at the time of initial diagnosis were associated with increased cancer mortality. multivariate analysis (by cox proportional hazards model), however, identified only age greater than 50 years, marked vascular invasion, and metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis to be independent predictors of follicular thyroid cancer-related mortality. patients with two or more of these predictors were classified as being high risk. these patients had 5- and 20-year survival rates of 47% and 8%, respectively; the corresponding survival data for the low-risk group were 99% at 5 years and 86% at 20 years. the identification of these risk groups may facilitate a more rational approach to treatment of follicular thyroid cancer.
left atrial decompression pump for severe heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: theoretical and clinical considerations. background the current classification of patients with new york heart association class iv symptoms does not offer adequate description to allow optimal selection of patients for the current options of medical and pacing therapies, cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support.   methods seven clinical profiles and an arrhythmia modifier were developed and implemented into the first year of data collection for the interagency registry for mechanically assisted circulatory support (intermacs). the intermacs coordinators' council provided ongoing feedback regarding the characterization of patients receiving implantable devices.   results the definition of 7 clinical profiles revealed that 80% of current devices are being used in the 2 profiles with the highest levels of clinical compromise. the intermacs coordinators' council helped to identify gaps in the characterization of hospitalized patients on temporary assist devices and of homebound patients with resting symptoms, which has led to revised definitions of profile 3 and 4 and the addition of 2 new modifiers, for temporary circulatory support devices in the hospital, and for frequent rehospitalization of patients at home.   conclusions patients considered for mechanical circulatory support can now be classified using the 7 profiles plus 3 modifiers developed through intermacs. further understanding these profiles and their impact on outcome should help to better select patients and therapies in the advanced stages of disease.
comparison of registered and published outcomes in randomized controlled trials: a systematic review purposein 2005 the international committee of medical journal editors issued a requirement that all randomized controlled trials (rcts) be registered primarily to prevent selective reporting (publication bias). however, registries allow for alterations in study protocol. changes occurring before (or after) study completion could invalidate the original study intent, leading to publication of misleading conclusions. in rcts involving critically ill patients, these concerns may be particularly acute because mortality is high and conditions investigated are usually syndromes rather than specific diseases. this study was conducted to estimate the registration rate of rcts in critical care; and, among registered rcts, to determine timing of registration and whether sample size or primary outcome were altered.methodswe searched the medline database for rcts that began after or continued through july 2005. we determined whether each trial had been registered and, for registered trials, compared registry data to data in the published manuscript.resultsapproximately two-thirds (66 %) of trials were registered. of these, 66 % of registrations occurred after enrolment had commenced. overall, 6 % (5/90) of trials appropriately registered a sample size which was unchanged from the interval between registration and publication, and only 12 % (11/90) reported primary outcomes that were both appropriately registered and unchanged.conclusionsnon-registration, or registration after trial initiation, are common in rcts of critically ill patients. among registered trials important protocol changes are often made between trial commencement and publication. this study identifies and quantifies the extent of this serious—but correctable—problem for rcts in critically ill patients.
economic optimization of wastewater treatment plants using non linear model predictive control abstract activated sludge wastewater treatment processes are difficult to be controlled because of their complex and nonlinear behavior, however, the control of the dissolved oxygen level in the reactors plays an important role in the operation of the facility. for this reason a new approach is studied in this paper using simulated case-study approach: model predictive control (mpc) has been applied to control the dissolved oxygen concentration in an aerobic reactor of a wastewater treatment plant. the control strategy is investigated and evaluated on two examples using systematic evaluation criteria: in a simulation benchmark – developed for the evaluation of different control strategies – the oxygen concentration has to be maintained at a given level in an aerobic basin; and a changing oxygen concentration in an alternating activated sludge process is controlled using mpc technique. the effect of some mpc tuning parameters (prediction horizon, input weight, sampling time) are also investigated. the results show that mpc can be effectively used for dissolved oxygen control in wastewater treatment plants.
why noise is useful in functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing? humans and other animals demonstrate the ability to perceive and respond to temporally relevant information with characteristic behavioral properties. for example, the response time distributions in peak-interval timing tasks are well described by gaussian functions, and superimpose when scaled by the criterion duration. this superimposition has been referred to as the scalar property and results from the fact that the standard deviation of a temporal estimate is proportional to the duration being timed. various psychological models have been proposed to account for such responding. these models vary in their success in predicting the temporal control of behavior as well as in the neurobiological feasibility of the mechanisms they postulate. a review of the major interval timing models reveals that no current model is successful on both counts. the neurobiological properties of the basal ganglia, an area known to be necessary for interval timing and motor control, suggests that this set of structures act as a coincidence detector of cortical and thalamic input. the hypothesized functioning of the basal ganglia is similar to the mechanisms proposed in the beat frequency timing model [r.c. miall, neural computation 1 (1989) 359-371], leading to a reevaluation of its capabilities in terms of behavioral prediction. by implementing a probabilistic firing rule, a dynamic response threshold, and adding variance to a number of its components, simulations of the striatal beat frequency model were able to produce output that is functionally equivalent to the expected behavioral response form of peak-interval timing procedures.
escape of sgs1 from rad9 inhibition reduces the requirement for sae2 and functional mrx in dna end resection abstract the mre11 complex is a central component of the dna damage response, with roles in damage sensing, molecular bridging, and end resection. we have previously shown that in saccharomyces cerevisiae, ku70 (yku70) deficiency reduces the ionizing radiation sensitivity of mre11δ mutants. in this study, we show that yku70 deficiency suppressed the camptothecin (cpt) and methyl methanesulfonate (mms) sensitivity of nuclease-deficient mre11-3 and sae2δ mutants in an exo1-dependent manner. cpt-induced g2/m arrest, γ-h2ax persistence, and chromosome breaks were elevated in mre11-3 mutants. these outcomes were reduced by yku70 deficiency. given that the genotoxic effects of cpt are manifest during dna replication, these data suggest that ku limits exo1-dependent double-strand break (dsb) resection during dna replication, inhibiting the initial processing steps required for homology-directed repair. we propose that mre11 nuclease- and sae2-dependent dna end processing, which initiates dsb resection prevents ku from engaging dsbs, thus promoting exo1-dependent resection. in agreement with this idea, we show that ku affinity for binding to short single-stranded overhangs is much lower than for blunt dna ends. collectively, the data define a nonhomologous end joining (nhej)-independent, s-phase-specific function of the ku heterodimer.
hippocampal damage and exploratory preferences in rats: memory for objects, places, and contexts. based on behavioral procedures aimed at measuring working or data-based memory for spatial location, response, and visual object information, it is shown that there is a triple dissociation among the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and extrastriate visual cortex in mediating spatial location, response, and visual object information, respectively. the hippocampus appears to subserve only spatial location, the caudate nucleus only response, and the extrastriate visual cortex only visual object information. the results support the neurobiological foundation of the attribute memory model.
on bahinia pondaungensis, an alleged early anthropoid a new genus and species of anthropoid primate, bahinia pondaungensis gen. et sp. nov., is described from the yashe kyitchaung locality in the late middle eocene pondaung formation (myanmar). it is related to eosimias, but it is represented by more complete remains, including upper dentition with associated lower jaw fragment. it is interpreted as a new representative of the family eosimiidae, which corresponds to the sister group of the amphipithecidae and of all other anthropoids. eosimiidae are now recorded from three distinct middle eocene localities in asia, giving support to the hypothesis of an asian origin of anthropoids.
humic acid decreases acute toxicity and ventilation frequency in eastern rainbowfish (melanotaenia splendida splendida) exposed to acid mine drainage. humic substances (hs) have been shown to decrease the toxicity of environmental stressors, but knowledge of their ability to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors such as metal mixtures and low ph associated with acid mine drainage (amd) is still limited. the present study investigated the ability of hs to decrease toxicity of amd to mayflies (atalophlebia spp.). the amd was collected from the mount morgan (mount morgan, queensland, australia) open pit. mayflies were exposed to concentrations of amd at 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% in the presence of 0 mg/l, 10 mg/l, and 20 mg/l aldrich humic acid (aha). a u-shaped response was noted in all aha treatments, with higher rates of mortality recorded in the 2% and 3% dilutions compared with 4%. this result was linked with increased precipitates in the lower concentrations. a follow-up trial showed significantly higher concentrations of precipitates in the 2% and 3% amd dilutions in the 0 mg/l aha treatment and higher precipitates in the 2% amd, 10 mg/l and 20 mg/l aha, treatments. humic substances were shown to significantly increase survival of mayflies exposed to amd by up to 50% in the 20 mg/l aha treatment. humic substances may have led to increased survival after amd exposure through its ability to influence animal physiology and complex heavy metals. these results are valuable in understanding the ability of hs to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors.
atrx loss promotes tumor growth and impairs nonhomologous end joining dna repair in glioma glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) is a lethal brain tumour in adults and children. however, dna copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases. to explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric gbm samples. somatic mutations in the h3.3-atrx-daxx chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). recurrent mutations in h3f3a, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant h3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (k27m, g34r/g34v) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. mutations in atrx (α-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome x-linked) and daxx (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for h3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a g34r or g34v h3.3 mutation. somatic tp53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with h3f3a and/or atrx mutations. screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n = 784) showed h3f3a mutations to be specific to gbm and highly prevalent in children and young adults. furthermore, the presence of h3f3a/atrx-daxx/tp53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. this is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult gbm pathogenesis.
does the presence of non-breeders enhance the fitness of breeders? an experimental analysis in the clown anemonefish amphiprion percula conflicts of interest are part and parcel of living in a social group, although these can reduce the fitness of individual members. here i show that clownfish (amphiprion percula) adjust their size and growth rate according to their position in the group hierarchy, maintaining a well-defined size difference with respect to individuals above them in social rank. this strategy to prevent conflict is a surprising departure from the more usual ploy used by many animals of modifying their behaviour within the group.
extended effects of air pollution on cardiopulmonary mortality in vienna air pollution consists of both gaseous and particulate-matter pollutants. the former include nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3), and sulphur dioxide (so2). the latter consist of particulate matter of varying aerodynamic diameter, as defined by cutoff points—for example, particles with diameters of ,10 mm (pm10) or ,2.5 mm (pm2.5). because of their small size, these particles can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and deposited in the alveoli. why should cardiologists care about ambient air? it has long been known that air pollution can adversely affect human health. extreme levels of pollution may cause markedly increased mortality rates; in this regard one often refers to the meuse valley fog of 1930 or the london smog of 1952. these episodes initiated successful efforts and legislation to reduce air pollution. nevertheless, even at current ambient pollution levels, the relation between pollution and excess morbidity and mortality still exists. however, the nature of the pollutants and the type of health effects have shifted, with a special emphasis now being placed on the heart rather than the lungs. maı̂tre et al. gathered the available epidemiological evidence on the association between coronary disease and air pollution at current ambient concentrations. from both biological and public health perspectives, one should distinguish between acute and long-term effects of air pollution.
specific sequences in the n-terminal domain of human small heat-shock protein hspb6 dictate preferential hetero-oligomerization with the orthologue hspb1 atp-independent small heat-shock proteins (shsps) are an essential component of the cellular chaperoning machinery. under both normal and stress conditions, shsps bind partially unfolded proteins and prevent their irreversible aggregation. canonical vertebrate shsps, such as the α-crystallins, form large polydisperse oligomers from which smaller, functionally active subspecies dissociate. here we focus on human hspb6 which, despite having considerable homology to the α-crystallins in both the n-terminal region and the signature α-crystallin domain (acd), only forms dimers in solution that represent the basic chaperoning subspecies. we addressed the three-dimensional structure and functional properties of hspb6 in a hybrid study employing x-ray crystallography, solution small-angle x-ray scattering (saxs), mutagenesis, size-exclusion chromatography and chaperoning assays. the crystal structure of a proteolytically stable fragment reveals typical acd dimers which further form tetrameric assemblies as a result of extensive inter-dimer patching of the β4/β8 grooves. the patching is surprisingly mediated by tripeptide motifs, found in the n-terminal domain directly adjacent to the acd, that are resembling but distinct from the canonical ixi sequence commonly binding this groove. by combining the crystal structure with saxs data for the full-length protein, we derive a molecular model of the latter. in solution, hspb6 shows a strong attractive self-interaction, a property that correlates with its chaperoning activity. both properties are dictated by the unstructured yet compact n-terminal domain, specifically a region highly conserved across vertebrate shsps.
interstitial f(2)-isoprostane 8-iso-pgf(2α) as a biomarker of oxidative stress after severe human traumatic brain injury. mammalian cells express a transport system known as system xc−, which is an exchange agency specific for anionic forms of cystine and glutamate. system xc− activity is important to maintain both intracellular glutathione levels and the redox balance between cystine and cysteine in the extracellular milieu. we have shown that the cloned cdnas encoding the transporter for system xc− consist of two components, xct and the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen. in the present study, we have investigated the mrna distribution for these components in the mouse brain by in situ hybridization. the xct mrna was expressed in the area postrema, subfornical organ, habenular nucleus, hypothalamic area, and ependymal cells of the lateral wall of the third ventricle in the adult mouse brain. a strong signal was also detected in the meninges in both adult and fetal mouse brains. the mrna expression of the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen was detected in a more broad area, including all of the regions in which xct mrna was detected. these data are compatible with our biochemical evidence that xct functions in combination with the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen to elicit system xc− activity. the expression of system xc− in meninges and some circumventricular organs may suggest that this transporter contributes to the maintenance of the redox state (i.e., cysteine/cystine ratio) in the csf.
on a weakness of the tu-deng function and its repair after the improvement by courtois and meier of the algebraic attacks on stream ciphers and the introduction of the related notion of algebraic immunity, several constructions of infinite classes of boolean functions with optimum algebraic immunity have been proposed. all of them gave functions whose algebraic degrees are high enough for resisting the berlekamp-massey attack and the recent ronjom-helleseth attack, but whose nonlinearities either achieve the worst possible value (given by lobanov's bound) or are slightly superior to it. hence, these functions do not allow resistance to fast correlation attacks. moreover, they do not behave well with respect to fast algebraic attacks. in this paper, we study an infinite class of functions which achieve an optimum algebraic immunity. we prove that they have an optimum algebraic degree and a much better nonlinearity than all the previously obtained infinite classes of functions. we check that, at least for small values of the number of variables, the functions of this class have in fact a very good nonlinearity and also a good behavior against fast algebraic attacks.
androgen deprivation followed by acute androgen stimulation selectively sensitizes ar-positive prostate cancer cells to ionizing radiation dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) can lead to the development of genomic rearrangements, which are hallmarks of cancer. fusions between tmprss2, encoding the transmembrane serine protease isoform 2, and erg, encoding the v-ets erythroblastosis virus e26 oncogene homolog, are among the most common oncogenic rearrangements observed in human cancer. we show that androgen signaling promotes co-recruitment of androgen receptor and topoisomerase ii beta (top2b) to sites of tmprss2-erg genomic breakpoints, triggering recombinogenic top2b-mediated dsbs. furthermore, androgen stimulation resulted in de novo production of tmprss2-erg fusion transcripts in a process that required top2b and components of the dsb repair machinery. finally, unlike normal prostate epithelium, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia cells showed strong coexpression of androgen receptor and top2b. these findings implicate androgen-induced top2b-mediated dsbs in generating tmprss2-erg rearrangements.
yeast “make-accumulate-consume” life strategy evolved as a multi-step process that predates the whole genome duplication modern yeast living in fleshy fruits rapidly convert sugars into bulk ethanol through pyruvate. pyruvate loses carbon dioxide to produce acetaldehyde, which is reduced by alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (adh1) to ethanol, which accumulates. yeast later consumes the accumulated ethanol, exploiting adh2, an adh1 homolog differing by 24 (of 348) amino acids. as many microorganisms cannot grow in ethanol, accumulated ethanol may help yeast defend resources in the fruit. we report here the resurrection of the last common ancestor of adh1 and adh2, called adha. the kinetic behavior of adha suggests that the ancestor was optimized to make (not consume) ethanol. this is consistent with the hypothesis that before the adh1-adh2 duplication, yeast did not accumulate ethanol for later consumption but rather used adha to recycle nadh generated in the glycolytic pathway. silent nucleotide dating suggests that the adh1-adh2 duplication occurred near the time of duplication of several other proteins involved in the accumulation of ethanol, possibly in the cretaceous age when fleshy fruits arose. these results help to connect the chemical behavior of these enzymes through systems analysis to a time of global ecosystem change, a small but useful step towards a planetary systems biology.
leukocytes and coronary artery disease oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxldl) has been characterized as an atherogenic molecule responsible for the induction of a variety of gene products. one such gene, tissue factor (tf), the cellular initiator of the coagulation cascade, is not expressed in normal vascular tissue but is expressed by monocytes and foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions. therefore, we examined the effect of oxldl on tf expression in cultured human adherent monocytes. endotoxin-free oxldl alone did not induce tf expression in adherent monocytes. however, oxldl significantly enhanced tf expression induced by the inflammatory mediator, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps), in a time- and dose-dependent manner. in contrast, oxldl did not alter lps-mediated production of interleukin-8 and actually inhibited lps-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, suggesting that some aspects of the signaling pathways for tf induction differ from those of other lps-responsive monocyte/macrophage gene products. thus, this study documents specific modulation of the expression of lps-inducible genes in monocytic cells by oxldl. factors that enhance tf expression in monocyte/macrophage cells present in atheroma may contribute to the severity of thrombotic episodes and complications observed in atherosclerosis.
sex-dependent responses to increased parental effort in the pied flycatcher a fundamental premise of life‐history theory is that organisms that increase current reproductive investment suffer increased mortality. possibly the most studied life‐history phenotypic relationship is the trade‐off between parental effort and survival. however, evidence supporting this trade‐off is equivocal. here, we conducted a meta‐analysis to test the generality of this tenet. using experimental studies that manipulated parental effort in birds, we show that (i) the effect of parental effort on survival was similar across species regardless of phylogeny; (ii) individuals that experienced reduced parental effort had similar survival probabilities than control individuals, regardless of sex; and (iii) males that experienced increased parental effort were less likely to survive than control males, whereas females that experienced increased effort were just as likely to survive as control females. our results suggest that the trade‐off between parental effort and survival is more complex than previously assumed. finally, our study provides recommendations of unexplored avenues of future research into life‐history trade‐offs.
the impact of spike timing variability on the signal-encoding performance of neural spiking models cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. to investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. we analyzed a “high-input regime” in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. to produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. we find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50–100 neurons. these column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. we find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10–50 msec). finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons—that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. the solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources.
tumor suppressor in lung cancer 1 (tslc1), a novel tumor suppressor gene, is implicated in the regulation of proliferation, invasion, cell cycle, apoptosis, and tumorigenicity in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma chemo- and radio-therapeutic regimens frequently kill cancer cells by inducing apoptosis, a cell-death subroutine that involves the activation of a particular class of proteases called caspases. in a recent issue of nature medicine, huang et al. (2011) show that caspase activation in dying tumor cells causes the release of soluble lipid messengers, notably prostaglandin e2, that stimulate tumor cell proliferation. in this short review, we will discuss the clinical and therapeutic implications of these findings.
swimming behavior and velocities of barnacle cyprids in a downwelling flume field observations imply that accumulation and advection of invertebrate larvae and other plankton by propagating fronts provides an efficient mechanism for the cross-shelf transport and subsequent coastal settlement of larvae and plankton. gravity currents propagating into a heavier, uniform-density fluid are known to have near-surface velocities u that exceed the propagation speed c of the gravity current nose. it is shown by simple dam-break laboratory experiments and through corresponding numerical solutions of two-dimensional stratified flow and lagrangian particle advection that this characteristic of gravity currents can lead to accumulation in the gravity current nose of particles that originate well behind the gravity current head. however, efficient particle accumulation and transport with the speed c only occurs for particles with sufficient vertical buoyancy or vertical swimming capability. weakly buoyant or neutral particles are swept down and back away from the gravity current head by the circulation in this region. a dam break into an ambient fluid with stratification (two-layered) could result in the transport of some particles that are initially trapped in the forepart of the leading disturbance, an undular bore. however, this situation does not result in significant accumulation of particles at the leading edge of the disturbance. the numerical solutions show that particles that originate in the dense fluid ahead of the gravity current are much less likely to be accumulated at the gravity current nose. a simple scaling criterion for the minimum vertical buoyancy velocity for efficient accumulation and transport of buoyant particles based on the gravity current and particle characteristics is developed and compares favorably with the numerical results. the implications of these results for transport of larvae in coastal environments are discussed. the dynamics of marine benthic invertebrate populations are greatly affected by larval transport. for near-shore populations, larval transport prior to settlement includes at least three processes: cross-shore advection, because larvae are generally very small and cannot control their cross-shore position by swimming alone; larval behavior, because by swimming vertically, larvae might be able to exploit some depth-dependent cross-shore flows; and accumulation by convergent circulation in propagating features, because cross-shore advection of larvae is often dependent on the retention of larvae at the propagating features. several hypotheses of onshore larval transport, namely surface slicks over linear internal waves (shanks 1983), internal bore warm fronts (pineda 1994), and upwelling relaxation fronts (farrell et al. 1991), invoke concentration of larvae at propagating features. these hypotheses state that larvae become concentrated at convergent features aligned parallel to the coastline and that larval transport occurs as these linear features propagate shoreward. the interplay between transport and accumulation is poorly understood; issues include (1) the dependency of transport on accumulation, and of accumulation on larval behavior, and (2) whether the frontal larvae originate onshore or off
when pain really matters: a vicarious-pain brain marker tracks empathy for pain in the romantic partner the current study investigates whether mere stereotypes are sufficient to modulate empathic responses to other people's (mis)fortunes, how these modulations manifest in the brain, and whether affective and neural responses relate to endorsing harm against different outgroup targets. participants feel least bad when misfortunes befall envied targets and worst when misfortunes befall pitied targets, as compared with ingroup targets. participants are also least willing to endorse harming pitied targets, despite pitied targets being outgroup members. however, those participants who exhibit increased activation in functionally defined insula/middle frontal gyrus when viewing pity targets experience positive events not only report feeling worse about those events but also more willing to harm pity targets in a tradeoff scenario. similarly, increased activation in anatomically defined bilateral anterior insula, in response to positive events, predicts increased willingness to harm envy targets, but decreased willingness to harm ingroup targets, above and beyond self-reported affect in response to the events. stereotypes' specific content and not just outgroup membership modulates empathic responses and related behavioral consequences including harm.
the role of serotonin in the nmda receptor antagonist models of psychosis and cognitive impairment rationale5-ht receptor mechanisms have been suggested to mediate improvements in cognition in schizophrenia.aimthe aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of 5-ht receptor mechanisms in sub-chronic phencyclidine (pcp)-induced reversal learning deficits in female rats, a task of relevance to schizophrenia.methodsadult female hooded lister rats were trained to perform an operant reversal learning task and then received sub-chronic pcp (2 mg/kg) or vehicle intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice daily for 7 days, followed by 7-day washout. rats then received an acute dose of the 5-ht7 receptor antagonist sb-269970a (1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle. in experiment 2, pcp-treated rats received the selective 5-ht2c receptor antagonist, sb-243213a acutely (1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle. in experiment 3, pcp-treated rats received the 5-ht1a receptor partial agonist, buspirone (0.15625, 0.3125, and 0.625 mg/kg, i.p.) in combination with the selective 5-ht1a receptor antagonist way-100635 (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg).resultsin all experiments, sub-chronic pcp significantly impaired reversal phase performance (p < 0.01–0.001), with no effect in the initial phase. sb-269970a at 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg significantly improved the pcp-induced deficit (p < 0.05). sb-243213a also significantly attenuated the deficit at 10 mg/kg (p < 0.05). in experiment 3, buspirone attenuated the deficit with significant effects at 0.3125 and 0.625 mg/kg (p < 0.05). way-100635 at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg produced a partial attenuation of buspirone’s effect as buspirone (0.3125 mg/kg) in the presence of way-100635 did not significantly reverse the pcp-induced deficit.conclusionsthese studies implicate the role of 5-ht7, 5-ht2c, and 5-ht1a receptors in the improvement of cognitive dysfunction of relevance to schizophrenia.
synergistic processing of visual contours across cortical layers in v1 and v2 the traditional view on visual processing emphasizes a hierarchy: local line segments are first linked into global contours, which in turn are assembled into more complex forms. distinct from this bottom-up viewpoint, here we provide evidence for a theoretical framework whereby objects and their parts are processed almost concurrently in a bidirectional cortico-cortical loop. by simultaneous recordings from v1 and v4 in awake monkeys, we found that information about global contours in a cluttered background emerged initially in v4, started ∼40 ms later in v1, and continued to develop in parallel in both areas. detailed analysis of neuronal response properties implicated contour integration to emerge from both bottom-up and reentrant processes. our results point to an incremental integration mechanism: feedforward assembling accompanied by feedback disambiguating to define and enhance the global contours and to suppress background noise. the consequence is a parallel accumulation of contour information over multiple cortical areas.
low-frequency atmospheric acoustic energy associated with vortices produced by thunderstorms abstract this paper attempts to explain the “whining” or “hissing” sound reported from tornadoes. the leading hypothesis is that the air masses involved in the tornado circulation execute some free vibrations. it is found that these vibrations may be in the audible range for a small vortex whose radius is of the order of 10 m. or less. a formula is obtained which relates the frequency of the tone to the inner radius of the vortex. this formula is amenable to experimental verification.
evaluation of a urine pooling strategy for the rapid and cost-efficient prevalence classification of schistosomiasis financial resources tend to be limited in schistosomiasis endemic areas, forcing program managers to balance financial and scientific considerations when selecting detection assays. therefore, we compared the costs of using single stool kato-katz, triplicate stool kato-katz, and point-of-contact circulating cathodic antigen (poc-cca) assays for the detection of schistosoma mansoni infection. economic and financial costs were estimated from the viewpoint of a schistosomiasis control program using the ingredients approach. costs related to specimen collection, sample processing and analysis, and treatment delivery were considered. analysis inputs and assumptions were tested using one-way and two-way sensitivity analysis. the total per-person cost of performing the single kato-katz, triplicate kato-katz, and poc-cca was us$6.89, us$17.54, and us$7.26, respectively. major cost drivers included labor, transportation, and supplies. in addition, we provide a costing tool to guide program managers in evaluating detection costs in specific settings, as costs may vary temporally and spatially.
robots for elementary schools robots increasingly have the potential to interact with people in daily life. it is believed that, based on this ability, they will play an essential role in human society in the not-so-distant future. this article examined the proposition that robots could form relationships with children and that children might learn from robots as they learn from other children. in this article, this idea is studied in an 18-day field trial held at a japanese elementary school. two english-speaking "robovie" robots interacted with first- and sixth-grade pupils at the perimeter of their respective classrooms. using wireless identification tags and sensors, these robots identified and interacted with children who came near them. the robots gestured and spoke english with the children, using a vocabulary of about 300 sentences for speaking and 50 words for recognition. the children were given a brief picture-word matching english test at the start of the trial, after 1 week and after 2 weeks. interactions were counted using the tags, and video and audio were recorded. in the majority of cases, a child's friends were present during the interactions. interaction with the robot was frequent in the 1st week, and then it fell off sharply by the 2nd week. nonetheless, some children continued to interact with the robot. interaction time during the 2nd week predicted improvements in english skill at the posttest, controlling for pretest scores. further analyses indicate that the robots may have been more successful in establishing common ground and influence when the children already had some initial proficiency or interest in english. these results suggest that interactive robots should be designed to have something in common with their users, providing a social as well as technical challenge.
cancer as biographical disruption: constructions of living with cancer there has been substantial empirical research on the health benefits of expressive writing. however, there has been less psychological research on the broader nature of writing and its relationship with health. the aim of this special section is to promote a more extensive engagement between health psychology and writing. it includes three articles on the value of investigating more established forms of writing, the nature of creative writing and the value of an intensive analysis of written accounts of illness. this article introduces this special section.
functional characterization of fusarium verticillioides cpp1, a gene encoding a putative protein phosphatase 2a catalytic subunit. yeast cells can select bud sites in either of two distinct spatial patterns. a cells and alpha cells typically bud in an axial pattern, in which both mother and daughter cells form new buds adjacent to the preceding division site. in contrast, a/alpha cells typically bud in a bipolar pattern, in which new buds can form at either pole of the cell. the bud3 gene is specifically required for the axial pattern of budding: mutations of bud3 (including a deletion) affect the axial pattern but not the bipolar pattern. the sequence of bud3 predicts a product (bud3p) of 1635 amino acids with no strong or instructive similarities to previously known proteins. however, immunofluorescence localization of bud3p has revealed that it assembles in an apparent double ring encircling the mother-bud neck shortly after the mitotic spindle forms. the bud3p structure at the neck persists until cytokinesis, when it splits to yield a single ring of bud3p marking the division site on each of the two progeny cells. these single rings remain for much of the ensuing unbudded phase and then disassemble. the bud3p rings are indistinguishable from those of the neck filament- associated proteins (cdc3p, cdc10p, cdc11p, and cdc12p), except that the latter proteins assemble before bud emergence and remain in place for the duration of the cell cycle. upon shift of a temperature- sensitive cdc12 mutant to restrictive temperature, localization of both bud3p and the neck filament-associated proteins is rapidly lost. in addition, a haploid cdc11 mutant loses its axial-budding pattern upon shift to restrictive temperature. taken together, the data suggest that bud3p and the neck filaments are linked in a cycle in which each controls the position of the other's assembly: bud3p assembles onto the neck filaments in one cell cycle to mark the site for axial budding (including assembly of the new ring of neck filaments) in the next cell cycle. as the expression and localization of bud3p are similar in a, alpha, and a/alpha cells, additional regulation must exist such that bud3p restricts the position of bud formation in a and alpha cells but not in a/alpha cells.
trends in mortality and medical spending in patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia: 1993–2005 purpose to assess the variation in length of stay for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia and to determine whether patients who are treated in hospitals with shorter mean stays have worse medical outcomes.   subjects and methods we prospectively studied a cohort of 1,188 adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia who had been admitted to one community and three university teaching hospitals. we compared patients' mean length of stay, mortality, hospital readmission, return to usual activities, return to work, and pneumonia-related symptoms among the four study hospitals. all outcomes were adjusted for baseline differences in severity of illness and comorbidity.   results adjusted interhospital differences in mean length of stay ranged from 0.9 to 2.3 days (p <0.001). when the risk of each medical outcome was compared between patients admitted to the hospital with the shortest length of stay and those admitted to longer stay hospitals, there were no differences in mortality [relative risk (rr) = 0.7; 95% ci, 0.3 to 1.7], hospital readmission (rr = 0.8; 95% ci, 0.5 to 1.2), return to usual activities (rr = 1.1; 95% ci, 0.9 to 1.3), or return to work (rr = 1.2; 95% ci, 0.8 to 2.0) during the first 14 days after discharge, or in the mean number of pneumonia-related symptoms 30 days after admission (p = 0.54).   conclusions we observed substantial interhospital variation in the lengths of stay for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. the finding that medical outcomes were similar in patients admitted to the hospital with the shortest length of stay and those admitted to hospitals with longer mean lengths of stay suggests that hospitals with longer stays may be able to reduce the mean duration of hospitalization for this disease without adversely affecting patient outcomes.
the halos‐nd model: a step in the journey of predicting hospital length of stay after liver transplantation the effect of obesity on outcomes following liver transplantation remains unclear. we reviewed our experience with 302 liver transplants in 277 patients from september 1989 to september 1996 to determine the effect of body mass on outcome. two hundred and seventeen transplants were performed in patients with a body mass index (bmi)<30 kg/m2, 55 in patients with a bmi of 30–34 kg/m2 (obese), and 30 in patients with a bmi>35 kg/m2 (severely obese). non‐weight related pre‐operative demographics were similar between groups with the exception of an increased frequency of cryptogenic cirrhosis among the obese and severely obese patients. intra‐operative transfusion requirements were greater for the severely obese group (16.2±3.5 units versus 9.1±0.8 units for the non‐obese, p=0.0004), though not when normalized to body weight (0.14±0.03 units/kg versus 0.13±0.01 units/kg, p>0.05). post‐operatively, severely obese patients had a higher rate of wound infection (20 versus 4%, p=0.0001) and death attributed to multisystem organ failure (15 versus 2%, p=0.0001), although overall mortality prior to discharge and total complications were not different between groups. actual 1‐yr graft survival showed a negative trend in the severely obese group (67 versus 81% for non‐obese, p=0.07), but both 3‐yr graft survival and patient survival were similar to non‐obese patients (p=0.12 and 0.17, respectively by the cox–mantel test). liver transplantation in severely obese patients is associated with wound infection and early death from multisystem organ failure, but has similar long‐term outcomes when compared to non‐obese controls.
on a weakness of the tu-deng function and its repair after the improvement by courtois and meier of the algebraic attacks on stream ciphers and the introduction of the related notion of algebraic immunity, several constructions of infinite classes of boolean functions with optimum algebraic immunity have been proposed. all of them gave functions whose algebraic degrees are high enough for resisting the berlekamp-massey attack and the recent ronjom-helleseth attack, but whose nonlinearities either achieve the worst possible value (given by lobanov's bound) or are slightly superior to it. hence, these functions do not allow resistance to fast correlation attacks. moreover, they do not behave well with respect to fast algebraic attacks. in this paper, we study an infinite class of functions which achieve an optimum algebraic immunity. we prove that they have an optimum algebraic degree and a much better nonlinearity than all the previously obtained infinite classes of functions. we check that, at least for small values of the number of variables, the functions of this class have in fact a very good nonlinearity and also a good behavior against fast algebraic attacks.
increased commuting to school time reduces sleep duration in adolescents introduction driven largely by international declines in rates of walking and bicycling to school and the noted health benefits of physical activity for children, research on children's active commuting to school has expanded rapidly during the past 5 years. we summarize research on predictors and health consequences of active commuting to school and outline and evaluate programs specific to children's walking and bicycling to school. methods literature on children's active commuting to school published before june 2007 was compiled by searching pubmed, psycinfo, and the national transportation library databases; conducting internet searches on program-based activities; and reviewing relevant transportation journals published during the last 4 years. results children who walk or bicycle to school have higher daily levels of physical activity and better cardiovascular fitness than do children who do not actively commute to school. a wide range of predictors of children's active commuting behaviors was identified, including demographic factors, individual and family factors, school factors (including the immediate area surrounding schools), and social and physical environmental factors. safe routes to school and the walking school bus are 2 public health efforts that promote walking and bicycling to school. although evaluations of these programs are limited, evidence exists that these activities are viewed positively by key stakeholders and have positive effects on children's active commuting to school. conclusion future efforts to promote walking and bicycling to school will be facilitated by building on current research, combining the strengths of scientific rigor with the predesign and postdesign provided by intervention activities, and disseminating results broadly and rapidly.
linezolid surveillance program results for 2008 (leader program for 2008). abstract the cfr (chloramphenicol-florfenicol resistance) gene encodes a 23s rrna methyltransferase that confers resistance to linezolid. detection of linezolid resistance was evaluated in the first cfr-carrying human hospital isolate of linezolid and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (designated mrsa cm-05) by dilution and diffusion methods (including etest). the presence of cfr was investigated in isolates of staphylococci colonizing the patient's household contacts and clinical isolates recovered from patients in the same unit where mrsa cm-05 was isolated. additionally, 68 chloramphenicol-resistant colombian mrsa isolates recovered from hospitals between 2001 and 2004 were screened for the presence of the cfr gene. in addition to erm(b), the erm(a) gene was also detected in cm-05. the isolate belonged to sequence type 5 and carried staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec type i. we were unable to detect the cfr gene in any of the human staphylococci screened (either clinical or colonizing isolates). agar and broth dilution methods detected linezolid resistance in cm-05. however, the etest and disk diffusion methods failed to detect resistance after 24 h of incubation. oxazolidinone resistance mediated by the cfr gene is rare, and acquisition by a human isolate appears to be a recent event in colombia. the detection of cfr-mediated linezolid resistance might be compromised by the use of the disk diffusion or etest method.
1,8-cineole, a trpm8 agonist, is a novel natural antagonist of human trpa1 camphor is a naturally occurring compound that is used as a major active ingredient of balms and liniments supplied as topical analgesics. despite its long history of common medical use, the underlying molecular mechanism of camphor action is not understood. capsaicin and menthol, two other topically applied agents widely used for similar purposes, are known to excite and desensitize sensory nerves by acting on two members of transient receptor potential (trp) channel superfamily: heat-sensitive trp vanilloid subtype 1 (trpv1) and cold-sensitive trp channel m8, respectively. camphor has recently been shown to activate trpv3, and here we show that camphor also activates heterologously expressed trpv1, requiring higher concentrations than capsaicin. activation was enhanced by phospholipase c-coupled receptor stimulation mimicking inflamed conditions. similar camphor-activated trpv1-like currents were observed in isolated rat drg neurons and were strongly potentiated after activation of protein kinase c with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. camphor activation of rat trpv1 was mediated by distinct channel regions from capsaicin, as indicated by camphor activation in the presence of the competitive inhibitor capsazepine and in a capsaicin-insensitive point mutant. camphor did not activate the capsaicin-insensitive chicken trpv1. trpv1 desensitization is believed to contribute to the analgesic actions of capsaicin. we found that, although camphor activates trpv1 less effectively, camphor application desensitized trpv1 more rapidly and completely than capsaicin. conversely, trpv3 current sensitized after repeated camphor applications, which is inconsistent with the analgesic role of camphor. we also found that camphor inhibited several other related trp channels, including ankyrin-repeat trp 1 (trpa1). the camphor-induced desensitization of trpv1 and block of trpa1 may underlie the analgesic effects of camphor.
mri findings reveal three different types of tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex background patients with tuberous sclerosis complex and drug-resistant epilepsy may be considered candidates for epilepsy surgery. this demands the unambiguous demonstration of the epileptogenicity of one of the tubers.   objective to test whether diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging enables differentiation of epileptogenic tubers from inert ones.   methods in 4 patients with clear unifocal interictal spike activity, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were performed. apparent diffusion coefficient maps were calculated in the identified epileptogenic tuber and compared withthose in nonepileptogenic tubers and regions of normal-appearing cortex.   results a significant increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient was found in the epileptogenic tubers. furthermore, the apparent diffusion coefficient of the nonepileptogenic tubers was significantly higher than the trace apparent diffusion coefficient of regions of normal-appearing cortex.   conclusion diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging may be of clinical importance for the identification of epileptogenic tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis and intractable epilepsy.
intervertebral disc herniation in adolescents. study design. the authors examined a case series of patients under the age of 18 years treated for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. objectives. to evaluate postoperative and long-term results of surgery in patients younger than 18 years. summary of background data. there are only a few series, with controversial results, available on the surgical treatment of disc herniation in growing patients. methods. between 1975 and 1991, a consecutive series of 129 patients 9–18 years of age (average age, 16.2 years) underwent surgery for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. low back pain associated with leg pain was the main clinical symptom in 106 subjects (82%), back pain in 17 (13%), and leg pain in 6 (5%). results. short-term results were excellent or good for 123 cases (95%), with complete pain relief in 97 (75%) and moderate but incomplete relief in 26 (20%). a total of 98 (76%) long-term responses obtained at a mean follow-up of 12.4 years revealed excellent outcomes in 40% of the cases, good in 47%, and poor in 13%. ten patients (10%) underwent reintervention after 9 years on average (2 fusions and 8 re-explorations for herniated disc). conclusions. results have confirmed a tendency for outcomes to deteriorate between the short-term and long-term follow-up in young patients treated by discectomy: this tendency and the rate of reintervention (10%) confirmed the need for long-term follow-up of children and adolescents treated for disc herniation.
perfused hearts from type 2 diabetic (db/db) mice show metabolic responsiveness to insulin. the metabolic phenotype of hearts has been investigated using rodent models of type 2 diabetes which exhibit obesity and insulin resistance: db/db and ob/ob mice, and zucker fatty and zdf rats. in general, cardiac fatty acid (fa) utilization is enhanced in type 2 diabetic hearts, with increased rates of fa oxidation (db/db, ob/ob and zdf models) and increased fa esterification into cellular triacylglycerols (db/db hearts). hearts from db/db and ob/ob mice and zdf rat hearts all have elevated levels of myocardial triacylglycerols, consistent with enhanced fa utilization. a number of mechanisms may be responsible for enhanced fa utilization in type 2 diabetic hearts: (i) increased fa uptake into cardiac myocytes and into mitochondria; (ii) altered mitochondrial function, with up-regulation of uncoupling proteins; and (iii) stimulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha. enhanced cardiac fa utilization in rodent type 2 diabetic models is associated with reduced cardiac contractile function, perhaps as a consequence of lipotoxicity and/or reduced cardiac efficiency. similar results have been obtained with human type 2 diabetic hearts, suggesting that pharmacological interventions that can reduce cardiac fa utilization may have beneficial effects on contractile function.
biomodeling of pancreatic tumor mass. abstract we study solid tumor (carcinoma) growth in the nonlinear regime using boundary-integral simulations. the tumor core is nonnecrotic and no inhibitor chemical species are present. a new formulation of the classical models [18,24,8,3] is developed and it is demonstrated that tumor evolution is described by a reduced set of two dimensionless parameters and is qualitatively unaffected by the number of spatial dimensions. one parameter describes the relative rate of mitosis to the relaxation mechanisms (cell mobility and cell-to-cell adhesion). the other describes the balance between apoptosis (programmed cell-death) and mitosis. both parameters also include the effect of vascularization. our analysis and nonlinear simulations reveal that the two new dimensionless groups uniquely subdivide tumor growth into three regimes associated with increasing degrees of vascularization: low (diffusion dominated, e.g., in vitro), moderate and high vascularization, that correspond to the regimes observed in vivo. we demonstrate that critical conditions exist for which the tumor evolves to nontrivial dormant states or grows self-similarly (i.e., shape invariant) in the first two regimes. this leads to the possibility of shape control and of controlling the release of tumor angiogenic factors by restricting the tumor volume-to-surface-area ratio. away from these critical conditions, evolution may be unstable leading to invasive fingering into the external tissues and to topological transitions such as tumor breakup and reconnection. interestingly we find that for highly vascularized tumors, while they grow unbounded, their shape always stays compact and invasive fingering does not occur. this is in agreement with recent experimental observations [30] of in vivo tumor growth, and suggests that the invasive growth of highly-vascularized tumors is associated to vascular and elastic anisotropies, which are not included in the model studied here.
performance analysis of data retrieval in wireless sensor networks we consider the use of energy harvesters, in place of conventional batteries with fixed energy storage, for point-to-point wireless communications. in addition to the challenge of transmitting in a channel with time selective fading, energy harvesters provide a perpetual but unreliable energy source. in this paper, we consider the problem of energy allocation over a finite horizon, taking into account channel conditions and energy sources that are time varying, so as to maximize the throughput. two types of side information (si) on the channel conditions and harvested energy are assumed to be available: causal si (of the past and present slots) or full si (of the past, present and future slots). we obtain structural results for the optimal energy allocation, via the use of dynamic programming and convex optimization techniques. in particular, if unlimited energy can be stored in the battery with harvested energy and the full si is available, we prove the optimality of a water-filling energy allocation solution where the so-called water levels follow a staircase function.
the impact of resistance training on swimming performance: a systematic review abstract dragunas, aj, dickey, jp, and nolte, vw. the effect of drag suit training on 50 m freestyle performance. j strength cond res 26(4): 989–994, 2012—little research has evaluated the effects of drag suit training in swimming; these effects need to be explored further to optimize their use in training. for this 5-week training study, 18 subjects were divided evenly into 2 groups: control group and drag suit–trained group. both groups performed weekly training routines that included 3 sprint sets. these sprint sets were performed by both the groups; however, the drag suit training group wore the drag suit, and the control group wore their typical training attire. we evaluated the swimmers' 50-m performance using a test set of six 50-m sprints on a 10-minute interval before and after the training program. the test set was performed twice (on 2 different days) where the swimmers were tested once in the drag suit and once in their regular training attire; the order of testing was randomized. final time, stroke rate, and distance per stroke were collected. we observed that the drag suit–trained group exhibited a statistically significant decrease in distance per stoke while wearing the drag suit and the control group showed a significant increase in stroke rate and decrease in distance per stroke (in both suits). it is suggested to include some amounts of drag suit training in periods where swimming volume may decrease. sets that are short in distance and performed at high intensity with sufficient rest to allow swimmers to maintain high stroke integrity should help athletes maintain techniques. we suggest incorporating the drag suit into the training regimen and should be considered a valuable resistive training device for swimming.
effect of exogenous lysine on the expression of early cephamycin c biosynthetic genes and antibiotic production in nocardia lactamdurans ma4213 abstractl-lysine is known to stimulate production of β-lactam antibiotics bystreptomyces clavuligerus via provision of the lysine breakdown product,l-α-aminoadipic acid, which is a limiting precursor. previous investigations utilized levels of 10–20 mml-lysine as an addition to chemically-defined media resulting in 50–100% improvement in antibiotic production. we were surprised to note that as the concentration was further increased, the organism responded by producing even higher titers of antibiotics. the optimum concentration of 100 mml-lysine yielded an approximate 500% increase in production with only minor effects on growth.dl- andd-lysine also exerted enhancements suggesting the presence of a lysine racemase or some other route fromd-lysine tol-α-aminoadipate in this organism;d-lysine was considerably less potent thandl- orl-lysine.
biological effects of prolonged exposure to elf electromagnetic fields in rats: iii. 50 hz electromagnetic fields. we studied the effects of an acute (45 min) exposure to a 60 hz magnetic field on sodium-dependent, high-affinity choline uptake in the brain of the rat. decreases in uptake were observed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus after the animals were exposed to a magnetic field at flux densities > or = 0.75 mt. these effects of the magnetic field were blocked by pretreating the animals with the narcotic antagonist naltrexone, but not by the peripheral opioid antagonist, naloxone methiodide. these data indicate that the magnetic-field-induced decreases in high-affinity choline uptake in the rat brain were mediated by endogenous opioids in the central nervous systems.
generation of a chinese hamster ovary cell line producing recombinant human glucocerebrosidase the purpose of this review is to describe the current status and to highlight several emerging trends in the manufacture of recombinant therapeutic proteins in cultivated mammalian cells, focusing on chinese hamster ovary cells as the major production host. over the past 25 years, specific and volumetric productivities for recombinant cell lines have increased about 20-fold as the result of improvements in media and bioprocess design. future yield increases are expected to come from further developments in gene delivery and genetic selection for more efficient recovery of high-producing cell lines and in high-throughput cultivation systems to simplify medium design and bioprocess development. other emerging trends in protein manufacturing that are discussed include the use of disposal bioreactors and transient gene expression. we specifically highlight current research in our own laboratories.
evaluation of factors affecting recovery period in lower lip hypoesthesia after sagittal split ramus osteotomy in mandibular prognathism patients. purpose the purpose of this study was to compare objectively, the recovery of hypoestheia of the lower lip following orthognathic surgery using different procedures (sagittal split ramus osteotomy [ssro]) and intra-oral vertical ramus osteotomy (ivro)) and fixation methods (monocortical plate fixation and bi-cortical plate fixation). hypoesthesia was evaluated using the trigeminal somatosensory-evoked potential (tsep).   patients and methods the subjects consisted of 174 patients (348 sides) with mandibular prognathism with or without asymmetry, who underwent mandibular ramus osteotomies using different fixation types. the patients were divided into 4 groups. the oam group consisted of 128 sides who had ssro using the obwegeser method with mono-cortical absorbable plate fixation, the odtm group consisted of 84 sides who had the obwegeser-dal pont method with mono-cortical titanium plate fixation, the otb group consisted of 32 sides who had the obwegeser method with bi-cortical titanium plate fixation and the vo group consisted of 104 sides who underwent ivro according to the bell method without fixation. trigeminal nerve hypoestheia at the region of the lower lip was assessed bilaterally by the tsep method. an electroencephalograph recording system (neuropack sigma; nion koden corp., tokyo, japan) was used to analyze the potentials. each patient was evaluated pre-operatively and then post-operatively at 1 and 2 weeks, 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1 year.   results the mean measurable period and standard deviation of tsep of the lower lip in the oam group was 5.2 +/- 9.9 weeks, 10.9 +/- 13.1 weeks in the odtm group, 7.8 +/- 4.5 weeks in the otb group, and 2.5 +/- 6.3 weeks in the vo group. there were significant differences between the oam and odtm groups (p < .0001), the odtm and otb groups (p = .0001), the otb and vo groups (p = .0221), the oam and vo groups (p < .0001), and the odtm and vo groups (p < .0001).   conclusion this study proved using objective measurements that the recovery period from hypoesthesia of the lower lip following orthognathic surgery was dependent on the surgical procedure. recovery in lower lip hypoesthesia after ivro was significantly earlier than ssro.
the role of information search in seeking alternative treatment for back pain: a qualitative analysis this research used the somewhat new methodology of convergent interviews to develop a conceptual framework about relationship constructs in an internet environment. more generally, this article describes and illustrates the processes and the strengths of convergent interviewing to investigate under‐researched areas, and compares it with alternative qualitative techniques like in‐depth interviews, case research and focus groups. the illustration involves interviews conducted with marketing managers and business consultants from ten service companies, about internet and relationship marketing. it is argued that convergent interviewing is more appropriate than some other qualitative methods to investigate under‐researched areas where there are few experts because it provides a way of quickly converging on key issues in the area, an efficient mechanism for data analysis after each interview, and a way of deciding when to stop collecting data. convergent interviews could become another useful qualitative research method to explore new issues about emerging marketing phenomena.
global biogeography and local adaptation of streptomyces understanding how microbial genotypes are arrayed in space is crucial for identifying local factors that may influence the spatial distribution of genetic diversity. in this study we investigated variation in 16s rdna sequences and rep-pcr fingerprints of streptomyces stains isolated from prairie soil among three locations and four soil depths. substantial variation in streptomyces otu (operational taxonomic unit) and box-pcr fingerprint diversity was found among locations within a limited spatial area (1 m2). further, phylogenetic lineages at each location were distinct. however, there was little variation in genetic diversity among isolates from different soil depths and similar phylogenetic lineages were found at each depth. some clones were found at a localized scale while other clones had a relatively widespread distribution. there was poor correspondence between 16s rdna groupings and rep-pcr fingerprint groupings. the finding of distinct phylogenetic lineages and the variation in spatial distribution of clones suggests that selection pressures may vary over the soil landscape.
activation of cardiac fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 causes left ventricular hypertrophy. chronic kidney disease (ckd) is a public health epidemic that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular disease. left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) is an important mechanism of cardiovascular disease in individuals with ckd. elevated levels of fgf23 have been linked to greater risks of lvh and mortality in patients with ckd, but whether these risks represent causal effects of fgf23 is unknown. here, we report that elevated fgf23 levels are independently associated with lvh in a large, racially diverse ckd cohort. fgf23 caused pathological hypertrophy of isolated rat cardiomyocytes via fgf receptor-dependent activation of the calcineurin-nfat signaling pathway, but this effect was independent of klotho, the coreceptor for fgf23 in the kidney and parathyroid glands. intramyocardial or intravenous injection of fgf23 in wild-type mice resulted in lvh, and klotho-deficient mice demonstrated elevated fgf23 levels and lvh. in an established animal model of ckd, treatment with an fgf-receptor blocker attenuated lvh, although no change in blood pressure was observed. these results unveil a klotho-independent, causal role for fgf23 in the pathogenesis of lvh and suggest that chronically elevated fgf23 levels contribute directly to high rates of lvh and mortality in individuals with ckd.
the role of intestinal oxalate transport in hyperoxaluria and the formation of kidney stones in animals and man active transcellular oxalate transport in the mammalian intestine contributes to the homeostasis of this important lithogenic anion. several members of the slc26a gene family of anion exchangers have a measurable oxalate affinity and are expressed along the gut, apically and basolaterally. mouse slc26a6 (pat1) targets to the apical membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine, and its deletion results in net oxalate absorption and hyperoxaluria. apical exchangers of the slc26a family that mediate oxalate absorption have not been established, yet the slc26a3 [downregulated in adenoma (dra)] protein is a candidate mediator of oxalate uptake. we evaluated the role of dra in intestinal oxalate and cl(-) transport by comparing unidirectional and net ion fluxes across short-circuited segments of small (ileum) and large (cecum and distal colon) intestine from wild-type (wt) and dra knockout (ko) mice. in wt mice, all segments demonstrated net oxalate and cl(-) absorption to varying degrees. in ko mice, however, all segments exhibited net anion secretion, which was consistently, and solely, due to a significant reduction in the absorptive unidirectional fluxes. in ko mice, daily urinary oxalate excretion was reduced 66% compared with that in wt mice, while urinary creatinine excretion was unchanged. we conclude that dra mediates a predominance of the apical uptake of oxalate and cl(-) absorbed in the small and large intestine of mice under short-circuit conditions. the large reductions in urinary oxalate excretion underscore the importance of transcellular intestinal oxalate absorption, in general, and, more specifically, the importance of the dra exchanger in oxalate homeostasis.
pharmacokinetics of intravenous n-acetylcysteine in men at rest and during exercise the production of reactive oxygen species in skeletal muscle is linked with muscle fatigue. this study investigated whether the antioxidant compound n-acetylcysteine (nac) augments time to fatigue during prolonged, submaximal cycling exercise. seven men completed a double-blind, crossover study, receiving nac or placebo before and during cycling exercise, comprising 45 min at 70% of peak oxygen consumption (vo2 peak) and then to fatigue at 90% vo2 peak. nac was intravenously infused at 125 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 15 min and then 25 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 20 min before and throughout exercise, which was continued until fatigue. arterialized venous blood was analyzed for nac concentration, hematology, and plasma electrolytes. nac induced no serious adverse reactions and did not affect hematology, acid-base status, or plasma electrolytes. time to fatigue was reproducible in preliminary trials (coefficient of variation 7.4 +/- 1.2%) and was not augmented by nac (nac 14.6 +/- 4.5 min; control 12.8 +/- 5.4 min). however, time to fatigue during nac trials was correlated with vo2 peak (r = 0.78; p < 0.05), suggesting that nac effects on performance may be dependent on training status. the rise in plasma k+ concentration at fatigue was attenuated by nac (p < 0.05). the ratio of rise in k+ concentration to work and the percentage change in time to fatigue tended to be inversely related (r = -0.71; p < 0.07). further research is required to clarify a possible training status-dependent effect of nac on muscle performance and k+ regulation.
a general scenario of hox gene inventory variation among major sarcopterygian lineages hox genes code for transcription factors that play a major role in the development of all animal phyla. in invertebrates these genes usually occur as tightly linked cluster, with a few exceptions where the clusters have been dissolved. only in vertebrates multiple clusters have been demonstrated which arose by duplication from a single ancestral cluster. this history of hox cluster duplications, in particular during the early elaboration of the vertebrate body plan, is still poorly understood. in this paper we report the results of a pcr survey on genomic dna of the pacific hagfish eptatretus stoutii. hagfishes are one of two clades of recent jawless fishes that are an offshoot of the early radiation of jawless vertebrates. our data provide evidence for at least 33 distinct hox genes in the hagfish genome, which is most compatible with the hypothesis of multiple hox clusters. the largest number, seven, of distinct homeobox fragments could be assigned to paralog group 9, which could imply that the hagfish has more than four clusters. quartet mapping reveals that within each paralog group the hagfish sequences are statistically more closely related to gnathostome hox genes than with either amphioxus or lamprey genes. these results support two assumptions about the history of hox genes: (1) the association of hagfish homeobox sequences with gnathostome sequences suggests that at least one hox cluster duplication event happened in the stem of vertebrates, i.e., prior to the most recent common ancestor of jawed and jawless vertebrates. (2) the high number of paralog group 9 sequences in hagfish and the phylogenetic position of hagfish suggests that the hagfish lineage underwent additional independent hox cluster/-gene duplication events.
dystrophins and daps are expressed in adipose tissue and are regulated by adipogenesis and extracellular matrix. we investigated the involvement of caveolin‐1 and the cytoskeletal proteins, actin and vimentin, in the adipogenesis of bovine intramuscular preadipocyte (bip) cells. immunoblot analysis demonstrated that levels of caveolin‐1 and actin gradually increased during adipose conversion in bip cells, whereas a slight decrease was observed for vimentin. we found that part of the vimentin was clearly distributed to caveolin‐1‐enriched membrane fractions in bip cells, but actin was not. during adipogenesis of bip cells, treatment with the tubulin depolymerizer, nocodazole, significantly increased intracellular triglyceride accumulation compared to non‐treated cells. immunocytochemical analysis showed that actin microfilaments were significantly disrupted in nocodazole‐treated cells. also, a decrease in the localization of vimentin in caveolin‐1‐enriched fractions and a failure of vimentin to co‐immunoisolate with caveolin‐1 were observed in nocodazole‐treated cells. these results suggest that a rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins has a role in the intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets during adipogenesis of bip cells.
the novel ugt1a9 intronic i399 polymorphism appears as a predictor of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin glucuronidation levels in the liver the human udp-glucuronosyltransferase, ugt1a9, catalyses glucuronidations of various endobiotics and xenobiotics. in the present study, all exons, exon-intron junctions, and the 5'-flanking region (-273 bp) of the ugt1a9 gene in a japanese subject were sequenced. one base insertion of thymidine in a promoter region of the ugt1a9 gene resulting in a(t)10at was identified compared to the reference sequence of af297093 (a(t)9at). the allele was termed ugt1a9*22. a polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism method was developed to genotype the allele. the allele frequencies of the mutation in 87 japanese, 50 caucasian and 50 african-american subjects were 60%, 39% and 44%, respectively. the significance of the polymorphism was investigated by the construction of luciferase reporter plasmids containing 170 bp of the 5'-flanking region of the gene transfected into human hepatoma hepg2 cells. the luciferase activity of the promoter construct containing the a(t)10at sequence was 2.6-fold higher than that of the construct containing the a(t)9at sequence. in conclusion, the mutant allele with one base insertion in the promoter region of the ugt1a9 gene would alter the level of enzyme expression and the metabolism of those drugs that are substrates of ugt1a9.
synergistic apoptosis induction by proteasome and histone deacetylase inhibitors is dependent on protein synthesis the targeted degradation of key regulatory proteins is an essential element of cell cycle control. the proteasome plays a central role in the degradation of such proteins and has therefore become an important therapeutic target for diseases involving cell proliferation, notably cancer. this review summarizes numerous studies demonstrating that proteasome inhibition induces apoptosis and sensitizes cancer cells to traditional tumoricidal agents both in vitro and in vivo. the potent and selective proteasome inhibitor, ps-341, is particularly promising from a therapeutic perspective, and it is the only such inhibitor that has progressed to clinical trials. preliminary data indicate that the drug is well tolerated by patients with cancer, and further trials are underway to assess the safety and efficacy of proteasome inhibition in hematologic and solid tumors, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other chemotherapeutics.
swarm algorithms with chaotic jumps applied to noisy optimization problems particle swarm optimization has become a common heuristic technique in the optimization community, with many researchers exploring the concepts, issues, and applications of the algorithm. in spite of this attention, there has as yet been no standard definition representing exactly what is involved in modern implementations of the technique. a standard is defined here which is designed to be a straightforward extension of the original algorithm while taking into account more recent developments that can be expected to improve performance on standard measures. this standard algorithm is intended for use both as a baseline for performance testing of improvements to the technique, as well as to represent pso to the wider optimization community
tgfβ isoforms and receptors mrna expression in breast tumours: prognostic value and clinical implications background genome-wide measures of gene expression can identify patterns of gene activity that subclassify tumours and might provide a better means than is currently available for individual risk assessment in patients with lymph-node-negative breast cancer.   methods we analysed, with affymetrix human u133a genechips, the expression of 22000 transcripts from total rna of frozen tumour samples from 286 lymph-node-negative patients who had not received adjuvant systemic treatment.   findings in a training set of 115 tumours, we identified a 76-gene signature consisting of 60 genes for patients positive for oestrogen receptors (er) and 16 genes for er-negative patients. this signature showed 93% sensitivity and 48% specificity in a subsequent independent testing set of 171 lymph-node-negative patients. the gene profile was highly informative in identifying patients who developed distant metastases within 5 years (hazard ratio 5.67 [95% ci 2.59-12.4]), even when corrected for traditional prognostic factors in multivariate analysis (5.55 [2.46-12.5]). the 76-gene profile also represented a strong prognostic factor for the development of metastasis in the subgroups of 84 premenopausal patients (9.60 [2.28-40.5]), 87 postmenopausal patients (4.04 [1.57-10.4]), and 79 patients with tumours of 10-20 mm (14.1 [3.34-59.2]), a group of patients for whom prediction of prognosis is especially difficult.   interpretation the identified signature provides a powerful tool for identification of patients at high risk of distant recurrence. the ability to identify patients who have a favourable prognosis could, after independent confirmation, allow clinicians to avoid adjuvant systemic therapy or to choose less aggressive therapeutic options.
blue light activates the plasma membrane h+‐atpase by phosphorylation of the c‐terminus in stomatal guard cells but is it an elephant? in the old tale, several blind men are taken to an elephant. in turn, each is asked to examine and identify the mystery object. one blind man examines a leg and claims it to be a tree, another, examining the trunk, claims it to be a snake, and yet another, feeling a tusk, claims it to be a smooth rock. the pattern continues: each describes a component, none identifies the gestalt. there are a wealth of blue-light responses in higher plants. it is clear that many are biochemically, physiologically, or genetically independent, and others are linked. the mechanism by which a photon of blue light is converted into a biochemical signal and transduced into a biological response is under investigation for several of these responses. in many cases, investigators have successfully defined one or more components of the signaling mechanism. taken together, the identified components have the potentia1 to define an entire signal transduction mechanism; receptor, g-protein, diacylglycerol, inositol triphosphate, calcium, calmodulin, several kinases, ion channels, and so forth. however, direct demonstration of a11 the components has not been achieved in any one system. indeed, in some cases specific carriers are known to be absent. further, the locations of the respective carriers differ in accordance with the location of the specific response (fig. l). perhaps the mechanisms responsible for transducing the blue-light signals are best represented by a herd of elephants. signal transduction paradigms are well established. however, recent data suggest that plants may have several nove1 signal carriers (deng et al., 1992), and it is not certain that the paradigms will be transferable to plants. the majority of studies of signal carriers for blue-light responses in higher plants make use of standard biochemical tools: direct identification based on biochemical properties or antibody crossreactivity, or indirect identification based on inhibitor/activator studies. these biochemical activities are correlated with the respective blue-light response by the photobiological activity (fluence response and/or time course), physical location, or involvement with the response as demonstrated by activator/inhibitor studies. the biochemical approach has recently been joined by a vigorous genetic approach. there are four blue-light responses in higher plants cur' supported in part by the national science foundation and the
the responsive approach: an integrated socially-sustainable technically-optimal decision model a fundamental requirement for effectively monitoring and operating transportation facilities is reliable, accurate data on traffic flow. the current state of the practice is to use networks of point detectors to gather information on traffic flow at fixed points on the roadway network. traffic monitoring based on wireless location technology (wlt) offers an opportunity to expand the size of the transportation network being monitored at a lower cost than with point detection. in wlt-based monitoring, the locations of individual wireless devices are sampled anonymously. by tracking a series of positions for devices in vehicles, it is theoretically possible to estimate the average travel speed on a road. although the concept of wlt-based monitoring is attractive, results have been mixed. field tests have been successful at locating vehicle positions but have not been able to generate traffic information of the quality or reliability required for most applications. this research explored how wlt-based monitoring could be improved by rigorously examining the problem from a system design perspective. the evaluation focused on two measures of effectiveness: (1) the availability of speed estimates and (2) the accuracy of speed estimates. the performance of wlt-based monitoring systems was evaluated through a combination of controlled testing on simple networks and case studies on simulated real-world networks. significant main effects and interactions were evaluated in a systematic manner using a test bed that combined microscopic traffic simulation and a model of a wlt-based monitoring system. the results revealed several important issues to be considered when designing and implementing a wlt-based monitoring system. the selection of parameters such as the number of vehicles tracked and frequency between readings needs to be tailored to handle localized traffic and geometric conditions. the results showed that well-designed monitoring systems could produce accurate results although there were some situations where performance could be improved. guidelines for the design and use of wlt-based systems were generated, and future avenues to improve system performance were noted.
familial melanoma: a meta-analysis and estimates of attributable fraction to assess whether screening people at high risk of malignant melanoma would be effective in reducing the mortality from the disease data from 400 case-control pairs in a study of cutaneous malignant melanoma conducted in western australia during 1980-1 were used to predict the risk of melanoma in the remaining 111 pairs. all variables previously shown to be associated with a decrease or increase in the incidence of melanoma were considered for inclusion in a single conditional logistic regression model of the incidence of melanoma in the randomly chosen subset of 400 case-control pairs. five of these variables--number of raised naevi on the arms, arrival in australia before 10 years of age, history of non-melanocytic skin cancer, time spent outdoors in summer from the age of 10 to 24, and family history of melanoma--provided good discrimination between patients and controls in this sample and the 111 other case-control pairs. among the 222 subjects in these other case-control pairs a group defined as being at high risk of melanoma by a risk score derived from these five variables contained 60 (54%) of the patients with melanoma but only 18 (16%) of the controls. these data suggest that in western australia more than half of all new patients with melanoma arise in an identifiable subpopulation constituting less than one fifth of the whole population. identifying this subpopulation and screening it regularly for cutaneous malignant melanoma could be cost effective in reducing mortality from this disease.
chianina beef tenderness investigated through integrated omics. within a population of charolais young bulls, two extreme groups of longissimus thoracis muscle samples, classified according to warner-bratzler shear force (wbsf) of 55 degrees c grilled meat, were analyzed by 2d-electrophoresis. muscle analyses were performed on 4 bulls of the "tender" group (wbsf=27.7+/-4.8 n) and 4 bulls of the "tough" group (wbsf=41.2+/-6.1 n), at 3 post-mortem times: d0, samples taken within 10 min post-mortem; d5 and d21, samples kept at 4 degrees c under vacuum during 5 and 21 days. proteins of muscle samples were separated in two fractions based on protein solubility in tris buffer: "soluble" and "insoluble". proteins of both fractions were separated by 2d-electrophoresis. evolution of spots during the 3 post-mortem times was analyzed by hierarchical classification (hca). three clusters of proteins presenting similar evolution profiles provided accurate classification of post-mortem times and showed the translocation of some chaperone proteins and glycolytic enzymes from the soluble fraction to the insoluble fraction between d0 and d5. cellular structure dismantlement and proteolysis was observed at d21. effect of group ("tender" vs "tough") on spot intensities was tested by anova. at d0, higher quantity of proteins of the inner and outer membrane of mitochondria was found in the tender group suggesting a more extensive degradation of mitochondria that may be related to the apoptotic process.
the ret receptor regulates sensory neuron dendrite growth and integrin mediated adhesion alternative splicing of the drosophila gene dscam results in up to 38,016 different receptor isoforms proposed to interact by isoform-specific homophilic binding. we report that dscam controls cell-intrinsic aspects of dendrite guidance in all four classes of dendrite arborization (da) neurons. loss of dscam in single neurons causes a strong increase in self-crossing. restriction of dendritic fields of neighboring class iii neurons appeared intact in mutant neurons, suggesting that dendritic self-avoidance, but not heteroneuronal tiling, may depend on dscam. overexpression of the same dscam isoforms in two da neurons with overlapping dendritic fields forced a spatial segregation of the two fields, supporting the model that dendritic branches of da neurons use isoform-specific homophilic interactions to ensure minimal overlap. homophilic binding of the highly diverse extracellular domains of dscam may therefore limit the use of the same "core" repulsion mechanism to cell-intrinsic interactions without interfering with heteroneuronal interactions.
evolutionary plasticity of segmentation clock networks background the pattern of somites is traced out by a mechanism involving oscillating gene expression at the tail end of the embryo. in zebrafish, two linked oscillating genes, her1 and her7, coding for inhibitory gene regulatory proteins, are especially implicated in genesis of the oscillations, while notch signaling appears necessary for synchronization of adjacent cells.   results i show by mathematical simulation that direct autorepression of her1 and her7 by their own protein products provides a mechanism for the intracellular oscillator. this mechanism operates robustly even when one allows for the fact that gene regulation is an essentially noisy (stochastic) process. the predicted period is close to the observed period (30 min) and is dictated primarily by the transcriptional delay, the time taken to make an mrna molecule. through its coupling to her1/her7 expression, notch signaling can keep the rapid oscillations in adjacent cells synchronized. when the coupling parameters are varied, however, the model system can switch to oscillations of a much longer period, resembling that of the mouse or chick somitogenesis oscillator and governed by the delays in the notch pathway. such notch-mediated synchronous oscillations are predicted even in the absence of direct her1/her7 autoregulation, through operation of the standard notch signaling pathway that is usually assumed simply to give lateral inhibition.   conclusions direct autorepression of a gene by its own product can generate oscillations, with a period determined by the transcriptional and translational delays. simple as they are, such systems show surprising behaviors. to understand them, unaided intuition is not enough: we need mathematics.
foreground segmentation of live videos using locally competing 1svms this paper examines the problem of moving object detection. more precisely, it addresses the difficult scenarios where background scene textures in the video might change over time. in this paper, we formulate the problem mathematically as minimizing a constrained risk functional motivated from the large margin principle. it is a generalization of the one class support vector machines (1-svms) [17] to accommodate spatial interactions, which is further incorporated into an online learning framework to track temporal changes. as a result it yields a closed-form update formula, a central component of the proposed algorithm to enable prompt adaptation to spatio-temporal changes. we also analyze the mistake bound and discuss issues such as dealing with non-stationary distributions, making use of kernels and efficient inference by a variant of dynamic programming. by exploiting the inherently concurrent structure, the proposed approach is designed to work with the highly parallel graphics processors (gpus) to facilitate realtime analysis. our empirical study demonstrates that the proposed approach works in realtime (over 80 frames per second) and at the same time performs competitively against state-of-the-art offline and quasi-realtime methods.
computational linguistics harnessing the statistical power of neural networks to perform language understanding and symbolic reasoning is difficult, when it requires executing efficient discrete operations against a large knowledge-base. in this work, we introduce a neural symbolic machine, which contains (a) a neural “programmer”, i.e., a sequence-to-sequence model that maps language utterances to programs and utilizes a key-variable memory to handle compositionality (b) a symbolic “computer”, i.e., a lisp interpreter that performs program execution, and helps find good programs by pruning the search space. we apply reinforce to directly optimize the task reward of this structured prediction problem. to train with weak supervision and improve the stability of reinforce, we augment it with an iterative maximum-likelihood training process. nsm outperforms the state-of-the-art on the webquestionssp dataset when trained from question-answer pairs only, without requiring any feature engineering or domain-specific knowledge.
kinetics of inhibition of soluble peripheral nerve esterases by pmsf: a non-stable compound that potentiates the organophosphorus-induced delayed neurotoxicity type b carboxylesterases (acetylcholinesterases, neuropathy target esterase, serine peptidases), catalyse the hydrolysis of carboxyl-ester substrates by formation of a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate and subsequent cleavage and release of the acyl group. organophosphorus compounds, carbamates, and others exert their mechanism of neurotoxicity by permanent covalent organophosphorylation or carbamylation at the catalytic site of carboxylesterases. classical kinetic studies converted the exponential kinetic equation to a logarithmic equation for graphic analysis. this process, however, does not allow analysing complex situations. in this paper, kinetic model equations are reviewed and strategies developed for the following cases: (a) single enzyme, with classical linear equation; (b) multi-enzymatic system—discriminating several inhibitor-sensitive and inhibitor-resistant components; (c) ‘ongoing inhibition’—high sensitive enzymes can be significantly inhibited during the substrate reaction time, the model equations need a correction; (d) spontaneous reactivation (de-phosphorylation)—one or several components can be simultaneously inhibited and spontaneously reactivated; (e) spontaneous reactivation from starting time with the enzyme being partly or totally inhibited; (f) aging—single enzyme can be inhibited, spontaneously reactivated and dealkylating reaction (‘aging’) simultaneously occurs; and (g) aging and spontaneous reactivation from starting time with the enzyme being partly or totally inhibited. analysis of data using the suggested equations allows the deduction of inhibition kinetic constants and the proportions of each of the enzymatic components. strategies for practical application of the models and for obtaining consistent kinetic parameters, using multi-steps approaches or 3d fitting, are presented.
morphological and molecular basis of cytoplasmic dilation and swelling in cortical migrating neurons during neural development, the cytoskeleton of newborn neurons undergoes extensive and dynamic remodelling to facilitate the sequential steps of neurogenesis, cell migration and terminal differentiation. it is clear from studying the mechanisms that precipitate these functions that different configurations of the cytoskeleton prefigure the correct execution of each step and define cohorts of proteins the functions of which are indispensable for the control of neuronal migration but not terminal differentiation. these combinatorial protein functions are also predetermined by regulated gene expression and the precise subcellular localisation of their protein products. here, we expand on this view in the context of recent data on how the cytoskeleton is regulated during the maturation of cortical neurons within the developing brain.
density estimation of the endangered udzungwa red colobus (procolobus gordonorum) and other arboreal primates in the udzungwa mountains using systematic distance sampling abstract hunting and habitat degradation are universal threats to primates across the tropics, thus deciphering the relative impact of threats on population relative abundance is critical to predicting extinction risk and providing conservation recommendations. we studied diurnal primates over a period of nearly 6 years in the udzungwa mountains of tanzania, a site of global importance for primate conservation. we assessed how population relative abundance of five species (of which two are endemic and iucn-endangered) differed between two forest blocks that are similar in size and habitat types but contrast strongly in protection level, and how abundance changed during 2004–2009. we also measured habitat and disturbance parameters and, in the unprotected forest, evaluated hunting practices. we found significant differences in primates’ abundance between protected and unprotected forests, with the greater contrast being the lower abundance of colobine monkeys (udzungwa red colobus and angolan colobus) in the unprotected forest. at this site moreover, colobines declined to near-extinction over the study period. in contrast, two cercopithecines (sanje mangabey and sykes’ monkey) showed slightly higher abundance in the unprotected forest and did not decline significantly. we argue that escalating hunting in the unprotected forest has specifically impacted the canopy-dwelling colobus monkeys, although habitat degradation may also have reduced their abundance. in contrast, cercopithecines did not seem affected by the current hunting, and their greater ecological adaptability may explain the relatively higher abundance in the unprotected forest. we provide recommendations towards the long-term protection of the area.
uddi registry for knowledge discovery in databases services the recent trend of application service providers (asp) is indicative of electronic commerce diversifying and expanding to include e-services. the asp paradigm is leading to the emergence of several web-based data mining service providers. this chapter focuses on the architectural and technological issues in the construction of systems that deliver data mining services through the internet. the chapter presents on-going research and the operations of commercial data mining service providers. we evaluate different distributed data mining (ddm) architectural models in the context of their suitability to support webbased delivery of data mining services. we present emerging technologies and standards in the e-services domain and discuss their impact on a “virtual marketplace of data mining e-services”.
effects of images with different levels of familiarity on eeg behavioral researches have shown that the visual function can be partly restored by phosphene-based prosthetic vision for the non-congenital blinds. however, the early visual processing mechanisms of phosphene object recognition is still unclear. this paper aimed to investigate the electro-neurophysiology underlying the phosphene face and non-face recognition. the modulations of latency and amplitude of n170 component in the event-related potential (erp) were analyzed. our preliminary results showed that (1) both normal and phosphene face stimuli could elicit prominent n170; nevertheless, phosphene stimuli caused notable latency delay and amplitude suppression on n170 compared with normal stimuli and (2) under phosphene non-face stimuli, a slight but significant latency delay occurred compared with normal stimuli, while amplitude suppression was not observed. therefore, it was suggested that (1) phosphene perception caused a disruption of the early visual processing for non-canonical images of objects, which was more profound in phosphene face processing; (2) the face-specific processing was reserved under prosthetic vision and (3) holistic processing was the major stage in early visual processing of phosphene face recognition, while part-based processing was attenuated due to the loss of the details.
degradation of mixtures of phenolic compounds by arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6 abstract arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6, a previously described 4-chlorophenol-degrading strain, was found to degrade 4-chlorophenol via hydroxyquinol, which is a novel route for aerobic microbial degradation of this compound. in addition, 10 open reading frames exhibiting sequence similarity to genes encoding enzymes involved in chlorophenol degradation were cloned and designated part of a chlorophenol degradation gene cluster (cph genes). several of the open reading frames appeared to encode enzymes with similar functions; these open reading frames included two genes, cpha-i and cpha-ii, which were shown to encode functional hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenases. disruption of the cpha-i gene yielded a mutant that exhibited negligible growth on 4-chlorophenol, thereby linking the cph gene cluster to functional catabolism of 4-chlorophenol in a. chlorophenolicus a6. the presence of a resolvase pseudogene in the cph gene cluster together with analyses of the g+c content and codon bias of flanking genes suggested that horizontal gene transfer was involved in assembly of the gene cluster during evolution of the ability of the strain to grow on 4-chlorophenol.
ischemia modified albumin: does it change during pneumoperitoneum in robotic prostatectomies? background and objective the aim of this study was to compare the effects of propofol and n-acetyl cysteine (nac) on tourniquet-induced ischaemia–reperfusion injury by determining malonyldialdehyde, ischaemia-modified albumin, lactate, blood gas and haemodynamic levels in arthroscopic knee surgery. methods sixty asa i or ii patients were randomized into three groups. intrathecal anaesthesia was administered using 0.5% heavy bupivacaine in all patients. in group p, propofol was administered in a 0.2 mg kg−1 bolus, followed by infusion at a rate of 2 mg kg−1 h−1; in group nac, nac was administered as an infusion at a rate of 5 mg kg−1 h−1, and, in group c (the control group), an equal volume of isotonic saline was administered to patients until 30 min after reperfusion. blood samplings were obtained immediately before intrathecal anaesthesia (t1), 1 min before tourniquet release (t2), 5 min after tourniquet release (t3) and 30 min after tourniquet release (t4). results plasma malonyldialdehyde, ischaemia-modified albumin and lactate levels increased significantly in group c at t3 and t4 compared with the baseline values. plasma concentrations of malonyldialdehyde, ischaemia-modified albumin and lactate in groups p and nac were significantly lower than those in group c at t3 and t4. in blood gas analyses, ph, hco3 and base excess were found to be significantly lower at t3 and t4 compared with t1 and t2 in group c. comparisons between groups p and nac revealed no significant differences. conclusion small-dose infusions of both propofol and nac appear to provide similar protection against ischaemia–reperfusion injury in arthroscopic knee surgery.
altered growth and root tip morphology in pisum sativum l. in response to altered expression of a gene expressed in border cells recently, ishikawa and evans (1995) focused attention on the immediately postmitotic growth zone of plant roots and indicated its importance in root growth in response to interna1 and externa1 factors. this previously unrecognized region of the root, intercalated between the apical meristem and the zone of rapid cell elongation, was originally discovered as the result of a morphometric analysis of the breadthlength ratios of cells along the length of the maize root (baluska et al., 1990). the analysis indicated that as cells are displaced away from the root apex, their growth is adjusted in such a way that, in the immediate postmitotic region, approximately isodiametric (cuboidal) cellular shapes are obtained. thus, the term "postmitotic 'isodiametric' growth" (or pig) was coined for this region. in the cortex of maize primary roots the pig zone was about 450 pm; in cultured tomato roots its length was about 380 pm. the length of this region thus represents about 5.5% of the entire growth zone. subsequent studies confirmed the uniqueness of the cells located in the pig zone, not only from a morphometrical point of view, but also on account of their specific cytological and physiological properties (barlow et al., 1991; baluska et al., l992,1994,1996a, 1996c; ishikawa and evans, 1992, 1993, 1995). from a cellular point of view, the root tip has (a) a zone of cell division, a zone of more-or-less isotropic cell growth in which the cells both elongate and increase in width at similar rates; and (b) a zone of elongation in which cell growth is distinctly anisotropic and the rate of elongation is much greater than in the pig zone. in cell-based terminology, therefore, the term "zone of cell elongation" should be reserved for root cells that grow in this strictly polar fashion. significantly, our morphometric studies at the cellular leve1 showed that an abrupt decline of cellular widening coincided precisely with a prominent increase in the rate of cell lengthening, and this occurred at the base of the pig region (baluska et al., 1990, 1994; barlow et al., 1991). this occurrence provided the first hint that the newly formed postmitotic cells of the root may undergo some kind of preparatory phase wherein they adjust or reorganize their growth from the formerly slow, mitotic mode of growth to a rapid mode of elongation. rapid cell elongation in roots is based in part on an extensive uptake of solutes coupled with the formation of a prominent vacuolar compartment. these events accelerate cell expansion, which is channeled with the aid of specific alignments of both the cortical microtubules (cmts) in the cytoplasm and the cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall, into strictly anisotropic cell enlargement. a significant reorganization of the metabolic machinery is required to achieve this new mode of cell growth. for example, cells of maize root apices increase their volume approximately 10-fold in the 13 h during which they migrate through the elongation region, whereas in the meristem cell volume may only double during this period (baluska et al., 1996~). once the rapid acceleration of cell growth has been triggered, it must be supported by a robust synthetic machinery that is obviously not yet operational in cells that are just ceasing their meristematic phase of development. if it were otherwise, root cells would commence their rapid elongation simultaneously with the termination of mitotic division. not a11 cells of the root cease to divide at the same distance from the root tip, and it was recently found that the proximal limit of the meristem fluctuates in a rhythmic manner in accordance with a programmed pattern of transverse cell division within its constituent cell files (liick et al., 1996). it is probably advantageous, therefore, for the early postmitotic root cells to enter a critica1 preparatory phase, located in a special transition zone behind the meristem, where they acquire the ability to embark on rapid elongation. moreover, some supracellular organizing process within this transition zone may ensure the simultaneous commencement of the rapid elongation phase in cells of different tissues (epidermis, cortex, stele, etc.) at a particular distance from the root tip. root-generated electric fields, for example, may be one way of defining the conditions required for a coordinated program of rapid elongation after cells have completed their preparatory phase within the transition zone. also, within this zone cells develop the necessary synthetic machinery for the biogenesis of new tonoplast and plasma membranes, cell-wall components, new enzymatic complexes, and cytoplasmic structures that support such rapid growth. aside from the basic synthetic machinery for cell growth, individual elements of the cytoskeleton can also be expected to alter their intracellular distribution from those configurations that support mitotic cell growth and division to arrangements that enable rapid cell elongation. in cells of the postmitotic transition zone, the cmts change from loosely organized transverse arrays to an exclusively transverse orientation with respect to the root axis; the latter orientation is often accompanied by the appearance of
mir‐204 downregulates ephb2 in aging mouse hippocampal neurons ephrin ligands and their cognate eph receptors guide axons during neural development and regulate synapse formation and neuronal plasticity in the adult. because ephrins are tethered to the plasma membrane and possess reverse signaling properties, the eph-ephrin system can function in a bidirectional, contact-mediated fashion between two opposing cells. eph receptors expressed on dendrites are activated by ephrins (on axons or on astrocytes) and regulate spine and synapse formation. they also participate in activity-induced long-term changes in synaptic strength such as long-term potentiation (ltp). when expressed on axon terminals, ephrins promote presynaptic differentiation and enhance neurotransmitter release, thereby supporting presynaptic forms of ltp. in some cases, eph receptors can simply act as ligands for ephrins without any requirement for eph receptor signaling, suggesting that the system does not always function bidirectionally.
a genetic dichotomy between pure sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (sef) and hybrid sef/low‐grade fibromyxoid sarcoma: a pathologic and molecular study of 18 cases sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma is an unusual variant of fibrosarcoma composed of bland epithelioid cells deposited in a densely hyalinised collageneous matrix.a 41 year male patient admitted with complains of pain in right hip since 6 months. he was a known case of fibrosarcoma (soft tissue) operated 3 years ago. on examination, old scar on medial aspect of right thigh was seen. tenderness was present over right greater trochanter. a biopsy was performed which was diagnosed as sclerosing epithelioidfibrosarcoma.sclerosing epithelioidfibrosarcoma is a rare, slow growing, sarcoma of deep soft tissue with bland epithelioid tumor cells in nests and cords set in hyalinized fibrous stroma. as it is a clinically aggressive but histologically low-grade sarcoma with unsatisfactory treatment results and also has a high recurrence rate with high metastatic potential, it is important to consider this rare entity as a possible differential diagnosis in all suspicious soft tissue sarcomas.
patterning of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived pan-mesoderm by activin a/nodal and bmp4 signaling requires fibroblast growth factor activity. the vertebrate fgf8 gene produces multiple protein isoforms by alternative splicing. two evolutionarily conserved spliceforms, fgf8a and fgf8b, exhibit distinct bioactivities, with fgf8b having a more potent inductive activity due to higher affinity for fgf receptors. to investigate the in vivo requirement for fgf8b, we created a splice-site mutation abolishing fgf8b expression in mice. analysis of this mutant has uncovered a novel function of fgf8 signaling before the onset of gastrulation. we show that the loss of fgf8b disrupts the induction of the brachyury gene in the pregastrular embryo and, in addition, disrupts the proper alignment of the anteroposterior axis with the shape of the embryo and the uterine axes at embryonic day (e) 6.5. importantly, fgf8-null embryos display the same phenotype as fgf8b-deficient embryos at e6.5, demonstrating that signaling by fgf8b is specifically required for development of the pregastrular embryo. by contrast, during gastrulation, fgf8a can partially compensate for the loss of fgf8b in mesoderm specification. we show that an increased level of fgf8a expression, which leads to fgf4 expression in the primitive streak, can also promote mesoderm migration in the absence of fgf8b. therefore, different fgf signals may have distinct requirements for the morphogenesis and gene regulation before and during gastrulation. importantly, our findings implicate fgf8 in the morphogenetic process that establishes the defined relationship between the axes of the embryo and the uterus at the beginning of gastrulation, a perplexing phenomenon discovered two decades ago.
metabolism of a fl atoxin b 1 in turkey liver microsomes : the relative roles of cytochromes p 450 1 a 5 and 3 a 37 cytochrome p450s (p450) play an important role in the formation of carcinogenic and mutagenic electrophilic intermediates from a wide range of xenobiotics, including naturally occurring dietary compounds. the pathogenesis of hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic action of the mycotoxin aflatoxin b(1) (afb(1)) involves initial bioactivation by p450s to a reactive and electrophilic intermediate exo-aflatoxin b(1)-8,9-epoxide (exo-afbo). poultry, especially turkeys are extremely sensitive to afb(1), a condition due, in part, to efficient epoxidation by p450 1a and 3a enzymes. we previously reported the discovery of p450 1a5 from turkey liver, which like its human homologue, 1a2, bioactivated afb(1) to exo-afbo and aflatoxin m(1) (afm(1)). here, we describe p450 3a37, the 3a4 homologue from turkey liver. this gene has an open reading frame (orf) of 1512 bp, and the protein is predicted to be 504 amino acids with 97% identity to chicken p450 3a37. a truncated construct of the turkey p450 3a37 gene with 11 amino acids deleted from the hydrophobic n-terminal region was heterologously expressed in escherichia coli, the protein from which exhibited a co difference spectrum typical of p450s. like human p450 3a4, 3a37 biotransformed afb(1) to exo-afbo and aflatoxin q(1) (afq(1)) and possessed nifedipine oxidation activity, both of which were inhibited by the p450 3a4 inhibitor 17alpha-ethynylestradiol. oxidation of afb(1) to exo-afbo and afq(1) by p450 3a37 followed sigmoidal hill kinetics, suggestive of an allosteric interaction between the enzyme and afb(1). the hill coefficient (n) value was 1.9 for exo-afbo and 1.6 for afq(1), indicative of positive cooperativity. the calculated k(m) and v(max) values for the formation of exo-afbo were 287 +/- 21 mum and 1.45 +/- 0.07 nmol/min/nmol p450, respectively, whereas those of afq(1) formation were 302 +/- 51 mum and 7.86 +/- 0.75 nmol/min/nmol p450, respectively. these data strongly suggest that p450 3a37, along with p450 1a5, plays an important role in afb(1) epoxidation in turkey liver.
efficient similarity search in nonmetric spaces with local constant embedding an important consideration in similarity-based retrieval of moving object trajectories is the definition of a distance function. the existing distance functions are usually sensitive to noise, shifts and scaling of data that commonly occur due to sensor failures, errors in detection techniques, disturbance signals, and different sampling rates. cleaning data to eliminate these is not always possible. in this paper, we introduce a novel distance function, edit distance on real sequence (edr) which is robust against these data imperfections. analysis and comparison of edr with other popular distance functions, such as euclidean distance, dynamic time warping (dtw), edit distance with real penalty (erp), and longest common subsequences (lcss), indicate that edr is more robust than euclidean distance, dtw and erp, and it is on average 50% more accurate than lcss. we also develop three pruning techniques to improve the retrieval efficiency of edr and show that these techniques can be combined effectively in a search, increasing the pruning power significantly. the experimental results confirm the superior efficiency of the combined methods.
adaptation of bacillus subtilis to growth at low temperature: a combined transcriptomic and proteomic appraisal. the alternative sigma factor sigmab of bacillus subtilis is required for the induction of approximately 100 genes after the imposition of a whole range of stresses and energy limitation. in this study, we investigated the impact of a null mutation in sigb on the stress and starvation survival of b. subtilis. sigb mutants which failed to induce the regulon following stress displayed an at least 50- to 100-fold decrease in survival of severe heat (54 degrees c) or ethanol (9%) shock, salt (10%) stress, and acid (ph 4.3) stress, as well as freezing and desiccation, compared to the wild type. preloading cells with sigmab-dependent general stress proteins prior to growth-inhibiting stress conferred considerable protection against heat and salt. exhaustion of glucose or phosphate induced the sigmab response, but surprisingly, sigmab did not seem to be required for starvation survival. starved wild-type cells exhibited about 10-fold greater resistance to salt stress than exponentially growing cells. the data argue that the expression of sigmab-dependent genes provides nonsporulated b. subtilis cells with a nonspecific multiple stress resistance that may be relevant for stress survival in the natural ecosystem.
wax ester synthesis is required for mycobacterium tuberculosis to enter in vitro dormancy the search for new tb drugs that rapidly and effectively sterilize the tissues and are thus able to shorten the duration of chemotherapy from the current 6 months has been hampered by a lack of understanding of the metabolism of the bacterium when in a ‘persistent’ or latent form. little is known about the condition in which the bacilli survive, although laboratory models have shown that mycobacterium tuberculosis can exist in a non‐growing, drug‐resistant state that may mimic persistence in vivo. using nutrient starvation, we have established a model in which m. tuberculosis arrests growth, decreases its respiration rate and is resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin and metronidazole. we have used microarray and proteome analysis to investigate the response of m. tuberculosis to nutrient starvation. proteome analysis of 6‐week‐starved cultures revealed the induction of several proteins. microarray analysis enabled us to monitor gene expression during adaptation to nutrient starvation and confirmed the changes seen at the protein level. this has provided evidence for slowdown of the transcription apparatus, energy metabolism, lipid biosynthesis and cell division in addition to induction of the stringent response and several other genes that may play a role in maintaining long‐term survival within the host. thus, we have generated a model with which we can search for agents active against persistent m. tuberculosis and revealed a number of potential targets expressed under these conditions.
an attempt towards simultaneous biobased solvent based extraction of proteins and enzymatic saccharification of cellulosic materials from distiller's grains and solubles. ddgs and wet distillers' grains are the major co-products of the dry grind ethanol facilities. as they are mainly used as animal feed, a typical compositional analysis of the ddgs and wet distillers' grains mainly focuses on defining the feedstock's nutritional characteristics. with an increasing demand for fuel ethanol, the ddgs and wet distillers' grains are viewed as a potential bridge feedstock for ethanol production from other cellulosic biomass. the introduction of ddgs or wet distillers' grains as an additional feed to the existing dry grind plants for increased ethanol yield requires a different approach to the compositional analysis of the material. rather than focusing on its nutritional value, this new approach aims at determining more detailed chemical composition, especially on polymeric sugars such as cellulose, starch and xylan, which release fermentable sugars upon enzymatic hydrolysis. in this paper we present a detailed and complete compositional analysis procedure suggested for ddgs and wet distillers' grains, as well as the resulting compositions completed by three different research groups. polymeric sugars, crude protein, crude oil and ash contents of ddgs and wet distillers' grains were accurately and reproducibly determined by the compositional analysis procedure described in this paper.
evaluating college students' displayed alcohol references on facebook and twitter. objectives. underage drinking contributes to the 3 leading causes of death (unintentional injury, homicide, and suicide) among persons aged 12 to 20 years. most adverse health effects from underage drinking stem from acute intoxication resulting from binge drinking. although binge drinking, typically defined as consuming ≥5 drinks on an occasion, is a common pattern of alcohol consumption among youth, few population-based studies have focused specifically on the characteristics of underage binge drinkers and their associated health risk behaviors. methods. we analyzed data on current drinking, binge drinking, and other health risk behaviors from the 2003 national youth risk behavior survey. prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by using sas and sudaan statistical software. logistic regression was used to examine the associations between different patterns of alcohol consumption and health risk behaviors. results. overall, 44.9% of high school students reported drinking alcohol during the past 30 days (28.8% binge drank and 16.1% drank alcohol but did not binge drink). although girls reported more current drinking with no binge drinking, binge-drinking rates were similar among boys and girls. binge-drinking rates increased with age and school grade. students who binge drank were more likely than both nondrinkers and current drinkers who did not binge to report poor school performance and involvement in other health risk behaviors such as riding with a driver who had been drinking, being currently sexually active, smoking cigarettes or cigars, being a victim of dating violence, attempting suicide, and using illicit drugs. a strong dose-response relationship was found between the frequency of binge drinking and the prevalence of other health risk behaviors. conclusions. binge drinking is the most common pattern of alcohol consumption among high school youth who drink alcohol and is strongly associated with a wide range of other health risk behaviors. effective intervention strategies (eg, enforcement of the minimum legal drinking age, screening and brief intervention, and increasing alcohol taxes) should be implemented to prevent underage alcohol consumption and adverse health and social consequences resulting from this behavior.
prospective, randomized trial examining the role of gentamycin-containing collagen sponge in the reduction of postoperative morbidity in rectal cancer patients: early results and surprising outcome at 3-year follow-up over 14 years 276 patients with rectal cancer underwent surgery; 219 who underwent low anterior resection of the rectum with total mesorectal excision were studied. there were 24 (11·0 per cent) major anastomotic leaks associated with peritonitis or a pelvic collection and 14 (6·4 per cent) minor leaks that were asymptomatic and detected by contrast enema. all major leaks occurred at an anastomotic height of less than 6cm (p = 0·08). the abdominoperineal excision rate was 9·1 per cent. major leaks were associated with failure to defunction in 11 of 62 patients and with a defunctioning colostomy in 13 of 157 (p = 0·03). of the 24 patients with major leaks seven developed peritonitis, one with a defunctioned anastomosis (p = 0·002), and three died (p = 0·02). use of the sigmoid colon led to major leakage in seven of 32 patients compared with 17 of 187 when the splenic flexure was employed (p = 0·05). there was no increase in the local recurrence rate but only nine patients with major leakage and a temporary stoma have had these closed. key technical factors incude: a clean dry pelvie cavity, pulsatile colonic blood supply, suction drainage started during closure and mobilization of ample tissue to fill the pelvic space.
toxoplasma gondii rhoptry kinase rop16 activates stat3 and stat6 resulting in cytokine inhibition and arginase-1-dependent growth control backgroundbrain inflammation plays a central role in multiple sclerosis (ms). dimethylfumarate (dmf), the main ingredient of an oral formulation of fumaric acid esters with proven therapeutic efficacy in psoriasis, has recently been found to ameliorate the course of relapsing-remitting ms. glial cells are the effector cells of neuroinflammation; however, little is known of the effect of dmf on microglia and astrocytes. the purpose of this study was to use an established in vitro model of brain inflammation to determine if dmf modulates the release of neurotoxic molecules from microglia and astrocytes, thus inhibiting glial inflammation.methodsprimary microglial and astrocytic cell cultures were prepared from cerebral cortices of neonatal rats. the control cells were treated with lps, an accepted inducer of pro-inflammatory properties in glial cells, and the experimental groups with lps and dmf in different concentrations. after stimulation/incubation, the generation of nitric oxide (no) in the cell culture supernatants was determined by measuring nitrite accumulation in the medium using griess reagent. after 6 hours of treatment rt-pcr was used to determine transcription levels of inos, il-1β, il-6 and tnf-α mrna in microglial and astrocytic cell cultures initially treated with dmf, followed after 30 min by lps treatment. moreover, we investigated possible involvement of the erk and nrf-2 transduction pathway in microglia using western blot analysis.resultspretreatment with dmf decreased synthesis of the proinflammatory mediators inos, tnf-α, il-1β and il-6 at the rna level in activated microglia and astrocytes in vitro, associated with a decrease in erk phosphorylation in microglia.conclusionscollectively, these results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of dmf may be in part functionally attributable to the compound's ability to inhibit expression of multiple neuroinflammatory mediators in brain of ms patients.
somatic embryogenesis from ovaries of sweet orange cv. tobias an improvement of the protocol for haploid induction through anther culture of citrus clementina hort. ex tan. cv. nules was achieved following the evaluation of a number of the factors affecting androgenesis. the influence of thidiazuron (tdz) and three temperature pre-treatments (4°c, 25°c, 32°c) on the floral buds with respect to anther culture of c. clementina hort. ex tan., cv. nules was investigated. an increased embryoid production was induced in the medium supplemented with tdz. pre-treatment temperatures of 4°c and 25°c were more favorable for embryo production than 32°c. regeneration of androgenic haploid plantlets from cv. sra 63 of c. clementina is reported here for the first time.
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor binding: autoradiographic localization in rat brain protein kinase c is a calcium- and phospholipid-stimulated enzyme present in high concentration in the brain. phorbol esters are potent tumor promoters that bind to specific receptors with high affinity. several lines of evidence indicate that the phorbol ester receptor is identical to protein kinase c. to determine the distribution of protein kinase c, we have localized phorbol ester receptors in the rat brain by autoradiography, using [3h]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3h]pdbu) and have performed a variety of lesions to assess the nature of the cellular elements possessing the binding sites. the [3h]pdbu binding sites in the rat brain are discretely localized and primarily associated with neurons. evidence is presented for localization to intrinsic neurons of the cortex and hippocampus, terminals of the striatonigral projection, a projection to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, and to dendrites of purkinje cells.
treatment of distal intestinal obstruction syndrome intestinal disease in cystic fibrosis (cf) mice closely mirrors aspects of obstructive syndromes in cf patients. the pathogenesis involves accumulation of mucoid debris in the crypts that fuse with intestinal content to form obstructing mucofeculant impactions. treatment involves modalities that increase the fluidity of the luminal content, such as osmotic laxatives and liquid diets. we investigated the effects of talniflumate (lomucin, genaera corporation, plymouth meeting, pa), a compound that may be beneficial to treatment of cf intestinal disease based on three mechanisms of action: mucus synthesis inhibition by blockade of the murine calcium-activated chloride channel 3 (mclca3), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory effects, and inhibition of cl–/hco –3 exchanger(s) involved in intestinal nacl absorption. cohorts of cf mice were fed control diet or diets containing either talniflumate (0.4 mg/g chow) or ibuprofen (0.4 mg/g chow) for 21 days to assess survival. talniflumate significantly increased cf mouse survival from 26 to 77%, whereas ibuprofen had no effect (22% survival). oral talniflumate did not alter crypt goblet cell numbers or change intestinal expression of mclca3 but tended to decrease crypt mucoid impaction. ussing chamber studies indicated that talniflumate slightly increased the basal short-circuit current of cf intestine, but the change was not sensitive to secretagogue stimulation or bumetanide inhibition. in contrast, intracellular ph measurements of intact intestinal villous epithelium indicated that talniflumate significantly inhibited apical membrane cl–/hco –3 exchange by >50%. we conclude that oral talniflumate increases the survival of cf mice, possibly by the beneficial effects of decreasing small intestinal nacl absorption through the inhibition of apical membrane cl–/hco –3 exchanger(s).
demonstrating the synergy between cac and scheduling in wireless networks in this study, we approach systems from an information theoretical perspective. specifically, we propose a framework to model systems by noisy communication channels and analyze them by this framework whose elements are commonly used analysis tools in science and engineering. a noisy communication channel model is a mechanism that accepts a set of inputs and yields a set of outputs. the formal mechanisms to exploit the relationships in the proposed framework include fourier series, uniform polygons, roots of unity, special permutations and polynomials. these formal mechanisms make the framework more powerful by enabling it to connect common analysis tools provided in complex analysis and graph theory.

magma chamber evolution : an energy-constrained geochemical model incorporating the effects of concurrent eruption , recharge , variable assimilation and fractional crystallization ( ece 0 ra fc ) a conservation-of-energy equation has been derived for the spatially averaged magma temperature in a spherical pluton undergoing simultaneous crystallization and both internal (magma) and external (hydrothermal fluid) thermal convection. the model accounts for the dependence of magma viscosity on crystallinity, temperature, and bulk composition; it includes latent heat effects and the effects of different initial water concentrations in the melt and quantitatively considers the role that large volumes of circulatory hydrothermal fluids play in dissipating heat. the nonlinear ordinary differential equation describing these processes has been solved for a variety of magma compositions, initial termperatures, initial crystallinities, volume ratios of hydrothermal fluid to magma, and pluton sizes. these calculations are graphically summarized in plots of the average magma temperature versus time after emplacement. solidification times, defined as the time necessary for magma to cool from the initial emplacement temperature to the solidus temperature vary as r1,3, where r is the pluton radius. the solidification time of a pluton with a radius of 1 kilometer is 5 x 104 years; for an otherwise identical pluton with a radius of 10 kilometers, the solidification time is ∼106 years. the water content has a marked effect on the solidification time. a granodiorite pluton with a radius of 5 kilometers and either 0.5 or 4 percent (by weight) water cools in 3.3 x 105 or 5 x 104 years, respectively. convection solidification times are usually but not always less than conduction cooling times.
attenuation of morphine tolerance by intrathecal gabapentin is associated with suppression of morphine-evoked excitatory amino acid release in the rat spinal cord recent studies indicate that glutamate binding to n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in the spinal cord is involved in triggering the development of chronic pain however, the processes which directly underlie the increased pain remain unclear. here we report that, following peripheral nerve injury (ligation of the sciatic nerve) in the rat, there is an increase in immunoreactive labelling of non-n-methyl-d-asparatate, ampa (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionate), glutamate receptors in the superficial laminae of the lumbar spinal cord ipsilateral to the ligation. the increase in ampa receptor expression peaks 14 days after nerve ligation and decreases 35 days post-ligation, corresponding to the time-course of heightened sensitivity to mechanical and thermal noxious stimuli (hyperalgesia) induced by the ligation. given evidence that ampa receptors in the superficial laminae mediate fast nociceptive transmission in the spinal cord, our findings suggest that an upregulation of spinal ampa receptors contributes to hyperalgesia following peripheral nerve injury.
functional characterization of fusarium verticillioides cpp1, a gene encoding a putative protein phosphatase 2a catalytic subunit. yeast cells can select bud sites in either of two distinct spatial patterns. a cells and alpha cells typically bud in an axial pattern, in which both mother and daughter cells form new buds adjacent to the preceding division site. in contrast, a/alpha cells typically bud in a bipolar pattern, in which new buds can form at either pole of the cell. the bud3 gene is specifically required for the axial pattern of budding: mutations of bud3 (including a deletion) affect the axial pattern but not the bipolar pattern. the sequence of bud3 predicts a product (bud3p) of 1635 amino acids with no strong or instructive similarities to previously known proteins. however, immunofluorescence localization of bud3p has revealed that it assembles in an apparent double ring encircling the mother-bud neck shortly after the mitotic spindle forms. the bud3p structure at the neck persists until cytokinesis, when it splits to yield a single ring of bud3p marking the division site on each of the two progeny cells. these single rings remain for much of the ensuing unbudded phase and then disassemble. the bud3p rings are indistinguishable from those of the neck filament- associated proteins (cdc3p, cdc10p, cdc11p, and cdc12p), except that the latter proteins assemble before bud emergence and remain in place for the duration of the cell cycle. upon shift of a temperature- sensitive cdc12 mutant to restrictive temperature, localization of both bud3p and the neck filament-associated proteins is rapidly lost. in addition, a haploid cdc11 mutant loses its axial-budding pattern upon shift to restrictive temperature. taken together, the data suggest that bud3p and the neck filaments are linked in a cycle in which each controls the position of the other's assembly: bud3p assembles onto the neck filaments in one cell cycle to mark the site for axial budding (including assembly of the new ring of neck filaments) in the next cell cycle. as the expression and localization of bud3p are similar in a, alpha, and a/alpha cells, additional regulation must exist such that bud3p restricts the position of bud formation in a and alpha cells but not in a/alpha cells.
wing phosphorylation is a major functional determinant of the lrs14‐type biofilm and motility regulator abfr1 in sulfolobus acidocaldarius in this study, the in vitro and in vivo functions of the only two identified protein phosphatases, saci-ptp and saci-pp2a, in the crenarchaeal model organism sulfolobus acidocaldarius were investigated. biochemical characterization revealed that saci-ptp is a dual-specific phosphatase (against pser/pthr and ptyr), whereas saci-pp2a exhibited specific pser/pthr activity and inhibition by okadaic acid. deletion of saci_pp2a resulted in pronounced alterations in growth, cell shape and cell size, which could be partially complemented. transcriptome analysis of the three strains (δsaci_ptp, δsaci_pp2a and the mw001 parental strain) revealed 155 genes that were differentially expressed in the deletion mutants, and showed significant changes in expression of genes encoding the archaella (archaeal motility structure), components of the respiratory chain and transcriptional regulators. phosphoproteome studies revealed 801 unique phosphoproteins in total, with an increase in identified phosphopeptides in the deletion mutants. proteins from most functional categories were affected by phosphorylation, including components of the motility system, the respiratory chain, and regulatory proteins. in the saci_pp2a deletion mutant the up-regulation at the transcript level, as well as the observed phosphorylation pattern, resembled starvation stress responses. hypermotility was also observed in the saci_pp2a deletion mutant. the results highlight the importance of protein phosphorylation in regulating essential cellular processes in the crenarchaeon s. acidocaldarius.
hsp90 regulates the fanconi anemia dna damage response pathway. standing watch over the proteome, molecular chaperones are an ancient and evolutionarily conserved class of proteins that guide the normal folding, intracellular disposition and proteolytic turnover of many of the key regulators of cell growth, differentiation and survival. this essential guardian function is subverted during oncogenesis to allow malignant transformation and to facilitate rapid somatic evolution. pharmacologically 'bribing' the essential guard duty of the chaperone hsp90 (heat-shock protein of 90 kda) seems to offer a unique anticancer strategy of considerable promise.
plasma homocysteine and dna damage profiles in normal and obese subjects in the pakistani population background moderate elevations in plasma homocyst(e)ine concentrations are associated with atherosclerosis and hypertension. we tested the hypothesis that experimental perturbation of homocysteine levels produces resistance and conduit vessel endothelial dysfunction and that this occurs through increased oxidant stress.   methods and results oral administration of l-methionine (100 mg/kg) was used to induce moderate hyperhomocyst(e)inemia ( approximately 25 micromol/l) in healthy human subjects. endothelial function of forearm resistance vessels was assessed by use of forearm vasodilatation to brachial artery administration of the endothelium-dependent dilator acetylcholine. conduit vessel endothelial function was assessed with flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery. forearm resistance vessel dilatation to acetylcholine was significantly impaired 7 hours after methionine (methionine, 477+/-82%; placebo, 673+/-110%; p=0.016). methionine did not alter vasodilatation to nitroprusside and verapamil. flow-mediated dilatation was significantly impaired 8 hours after methionine loading (0.3+/-2.7%) compared with placebo (8. 2+/-1.6%, p=0.01). oral administration of the antioxidant ascorbic acid (2 g) prevented methionine-induced endothelial dysfunction in both conduit and resistance vessels (p=0.03).   conclusions experimentally increasing plasma homocyst(e)ine concentrations by methionine loading rapidly impairs both conduit and resistance vessel endothelial function in healthy humans. endothelial dysfunction in conduit and resistance vessels may underlie the reported associations between homocysteine and atherosclerosis and hypertension. increased oxidant stress appears to play a pathophysiological role in the deleterious endothelial effects of homocysteine.
the search-ification of everyday life and the mundane-ification of search web search engines have become indispensable tools for finding information online effectively. as the range of information, context and users of internet searches has grown, the relationship between the search query, search interest and user has become more tenuous. not all users are seeking the same information, even if they use the same query term. thus, the quality of search results has, at least potentially, been decreasing. search engines have begun to respond to this problem by trying to personalise search in order to deliver more relevant results to the users. a query is now evaluated in the context of a user’s search history and other data compiled into a personal profile and associated with statistical groups. this, at least, is the promise stated by the search engines themselves. this paper tries to assess the current reality of the personalisation of search results. we analyse the mechanisms of personalisation in the case of google web search by empirically testing three commonly held assumptions about what personalisation does. to do this, we developed new digital methods which are explained here. the findings suggest that google personal search does not fully provide the much-touted benefits for its search users. more likely, it seems to serve the interest of advertisers in providing more relevant audiences to them.
structural determinants for alternative splicing regulation of the mapt pre-mrna we have determined the sequences of isoforms of human tau protein, which differ from previously reported forms by insertions of 29 or 58 amino acids in the amino-terminal region. complementary dna cloning shows that the insertions occur in combination with both three and four tandem repeats. rnaase protection assays indicate that transcripts encoding isoforms with the insertions are expressed in an adult-specific manner. transcripts encoding four tandem repeats are also expressed in an adult-specific manner, whereas mrnas encoding three tandem repeats are expressed throughout life, including in fetal brain. the levels of transcripts encoding the 29 or 58 amino acid inserts were not significantly changed in cerebral cortex from patients with alzheimer's disease. antisera raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to these different human tau isoforms demonstrate that multiple tau protein isoforms are incorporated into the neurofibrillary tangles of alzheimer's disease.
consurf 2016: an improved methodology to estimate and visualize evolutionary conservation in macromolecules motivation a number of proteins of known three-dimensional (3d) structure exist, with yet unknown function. in light of the recent progress in structure determination methodology, this number is likely to increase rapidly. a novel method is presented here: 'rate4site', which maps the rate of evolution among homologous proteins onto the molecular surface of one of the homologues whose 3d-structure is known. functionally important regions often correspond to surface patches of slowly evolving residues.   results rate4site estimates the rate of evolution of amino acid sites using the maximum likelihood (ml) principle. the ml estimate of the rates considers the topology and branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree, as well as the underlying stochastic process. to demonstrate its potency, we study the src sh2 domain. like previously established methods, rate4site detected the sh2 peptide-binding groove. interestingly, it also detected inter-domain interactions between the sh2 domain and the rest of the src protein that other methods failed to detect.
parallel matrix computations using a reconfigurable pipelined optical bus we present several optical interconnection structures which support communication requirements unique to multiprocessor systems, namely, broadcasting, multicasting, simulcasting, and multiport memory access. the structures are based on guided wave time division multiplexed channels and use coincident pulse techniques to optically demultiplex individual bits at selected destinations. we describe 1-and 2-d structures which are appropriate for processor to processor interconnections and for processor to memory interconnections, respectively.
arpp/ankrd2, a member of the muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (marps), translocates from the i-band to the nucleus after muscle injury in this study, we isolated and characterized a murine counterpart of the human arpp (harpp) gene. sequence analysis revealed that the murine arpp (marpp) gene is almost identical to the ankrd2 gene, which has recently been isolated as a mouse gene induced in stretched skeletal muscle. the marpp gene encodes a protein of 332 amino acids that contains four well-conserved ankyrin-repeat domains in the central portion of the protein. the amino acid sequence of marpp protein (marpp) is highly homologous to that of mouse cardiac-restricted ankyrin-repeat protein (carp), which is proposed to be a putative genetic marker for cardiac hypertrophy. immunohistochemical analysis revealed that marpp is preferentially expressed in type 1 skeletal muscle fibers, and that marpp is localized in both the nucleus and the sarcomeric i-band of muscle fibers, suggesting that arpp may function as a nuclear and sarcomeric protein. furthermore, marpp was also expressed in neurons of the cerebellum and cerebrum, the islets of langerhans in the pancreas, and the esophageal epithelium, suggesting that marpp may play a functional physiologic role in brain, pancreas, and esophagus as well as in type 1 muscle fibers. interestingly, although marpp was localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm in neurons, its localization was restricted to nucleus in pancreas and esophagus, suggesting that intracellular localization of marpp is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. furthermore, we found that marpp- and carp-expression in skeletal muscle were markedly up-regulated after denervation. although the elevated expression level of carp was kept only for two weeks after denervation, that of arpp was kept at least for 4 weeks, suggesting that marpp and carp may play distinct functional roles in denervated skeletal muscle.
effects of emotion regulation difficulties on the tonic and phasic cardiac autonomic response we examined the relationship between tonic--a correlate of self-regulatory functioning--and phasic cardiac vagal activity (indexed by heart rate variability; hrv) during a selective attentional task with varying levels of load. participants detected a target letter among letter strings superimposed on either fearful or neutral face distractors. letter strings consisted of six target letters under low load and one target letter and five nontarget letters under high load. with fearful distractors, lower tonic hrv was associated with phasic hrv suppression, suggesting an autonomic stress response under both low and high load. in contrast, higher tonic hrv was associated with phasic hrv enhancement, suggesting greater self-regulatory effort under low load and an absence of phasic hrv suppression under high load. the current research suggests that tonic cardiac vagal tone is associated with the ability to flexibly adapt autonomic responses.
crystal growth of high-quality protein crystals under the presence of an alternant electric field in pulse-wave mode, and a strong magnetic field with radio frequency pulses characterized by x-ray diffraction protein crystallization under a magnetic field is an interesting research topic because a magnetic field may provide a special environment to acquire improved quality protein crystals. because high-quality protein crystals are very useful in high-resolution structure determination using diffraction techniques (x-ray, neutron, and electron diffraction), research using magnetic fields in protein crystallization has attracted substantial interest; some studies have been performed in the past two decades. in this research field, the hardware is especially essential for successful studies because the environment is special and the design and utilization of the research apparatus in such an environment requires special considerations related to the magnetic field. this paper reviews the hardware for protein crystallization (including the magnet systems and the apparatus designed for use in a magnetic field) and progress in this area. future prospects in this field will also be discussed.
mix-distribution modeling for overcomplete denoising de-noising with the traditional (orthogonal, maximally-decimated) wavelet transform sometimes exhibits visual artifacts; we attribute some of these—for example, gibbs phenomena in the neighborhood of discontinuities—to the lack of translation invariance of the wavelet basis. one method to suppress such artifacts, termed “cycle spinning” by coifman, is to “average out” the translation dependence. for a range of shifts, one shifts the data (right or left as the case may be), de-noises the shifted data, and then unshifts the de-noised data. doing this for each of a range of shifts, and averaging the several results so obtained, produces a reconstruction subject to far weaker gibbs phenomena than thresholding based de-noising using the traditional orthogonal wavelet transform.
psychiatric comorbidities in a community sample of women with fibromyalgia objective traumatic events can result in a set of symptoms including nightmares, recurrent and intrusive recollections, avoidance of thoughts or activities associated with the traumatic event, and symptoms of increased arousal such as insomnia and hypervigilance. these posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd)-like symptoms are frequently observed in persons with chronic pain syndromes. little is known about how these two phenomena interact with one another. the present study evaluated ptsd-like symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (fms) and examined the relation between ptsd-like symptoms and problems associated with fms.   design ninety-three consecutive patients underwent a comprehensive fms evaluation and completed self-report questionnaires measuring ptsd-like symptoms, disability, and psychosocial responses to their pain condition. subjects were divided in two groups based on level of self-reported ptsd-like symptoms.   results approximately 56% of the sample reported clinically significant levels of ptsd-like symptoms (ptsd+). the ptsd+ patients reported significantly greater levels of pain (p < 0.01), emotional distress (p < 0.01), life interference (p < 0.01), and disability (p < 0.01) than did the patients without clinically significant levels of ptsd-like symptoms (ptsd-). over 85% of the ptsd+ patients compared with 50% of the ptsd- patients demonstrated significant disability. based on response to the multidimensional pain inventory, a significantly smaller percentage of ptsd+ patients were classified as adaptive copers (15%) compared with the ptsd- group (48.2%).   conclusions results suggest that ptsd-like symptoms are prevalent in fms patients and may influence adaptation to this chronic illness. clinicians should assess the presence of these symptoms, as the failure to attend to them in treatment may impede successful outcomes.
anti-idiotypic antibodies specific to prm monoantibody prevent antibody dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection thrombocytopenia is common in patients with dengue virus (denv) infections. with a focus on understanding the possible mechanism of thrombocytopenia in denv infections we described a direct correlation between activation and depletion of platelets in patients. our data showed a sharp decrease in platelet counts at day 4 of fever in patients. the high denv genome copies in platelets correlated directly with the elevated platelet activation along with increased binding of complement factor c3 and igg on their surface at day 4. recovery in platelet count was observed on day 10 through day 6 and 8 with simultaneous decrease in platelet activation markers. further, our in vitro data supported the above observations describing a concentration-dependent increase in platelet activation by denv serotype-2. the high copy number of denv2 genome in the platelet pellet correlated directly with platelet activation, microparticle generation and clot formation. furthermore the denv2-activated platelets were phagocytosed in large numbers by the monocytes. the denv2-mediated lysis and clearance of platelets were abrogated in presence of platelet activation inhibitor, prostacyclin. these observations collectively suggest that platelet activation status is an important determinant of thrombocytopenia in dengue infections. a careful strategy of inactivation of platelets may rescue them from rapid destruction during denv infections.
a versatile assay for rna-binding proteins in living cells. ultraviolet (uv) irradiation can initiate complex formation between proteins and dna or rna and so can be used to study such interactions. however, crosslink formation by standard uv light sources can take up to several hours. more recently, a beam of monochromatic uv light from a laser has been used to initiate crosslinking in nano- and picosecond time intervals. as noted in an earlier tibs article 'the advantages of short pulse times and high-energy fluxes should make this a valuable technique in the future'. in this review we characterize laser-induced crosslinking and explore the applications of this method.
quantifying cfse label decay in flow cytometry data in most biological studies and processes, cell proliferation and population dynamics play an essential role. due to this ubiquity, a multitude of mathematical models has been developed to describe these processes. while the simplest models only consider the size of the overall populations, others take division numbers and labeling of the cells into account. in this work, we present a modeling and computational framework for proliferating cell populations undergoing symmetric cell division, which incorporates both the discrete division number and continuous label dynamics. thus, it allows for the consideration of division number-dependent parameters as well as the direct comparison of the model prediction with labeling experiments, e.g., performed with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (cfse), and can be shown to be a generalization of most existing models used to describe these data. we prove that under mild assumptions the resulting system of coupled partial differential equations (pdes) can be decomposed into a system of ordinary differential equations (odes) and a set of decoupled pdes, which drastically reduces the computational effort for simulating the model. furthermore, the pdes are solved analytically and the ode system is truncated, which allows for the prediction of the label distribution of complex systems using a low-dimensional system of odes. in addition to modeling the label dynamics, we link the label-induced fluorescence to the measure fluorescence which includes autofluorescence. furthermore, we provide an analytical approximation for the resulting numerically challenging convolution integral. this is illustrated by modeling and simulating a proliferating population with division number-dependent proliferation rate.
design and analysis of double-gate mosfets for ultra-low power radio frequency identification (rfid): device and circuit co-design subthreshold region of operation has gained wide research interest for applications requiring ultra low power consumption and medium frequency of operation. double gate mosfets are proved to be better candidates for subthreshold operation due to their near ideal subthreshold slope and negligible gate capacitance. however it is not yet clear whether symmetric (sdg) or asymmetric (adg) dg with options of tied (3t) and independent gates (4t) are optimal for subthreshold circuit design. in this paper, we compare the performance characteristics of sdg and adg circuits with tied(3t) and independent gate(4t) options for the subthreshold logic by applying them to some basic logic gates such as nand, nor gates for the 32nm technology node. we also present the performance comparisons of sdg and adg circuits for subthreshold logic in the presence of supply voltage and temperature variations. we found that 3t adg circuits offer approximately 13–14% better power consumption, 4–5% better speed and 16–18.3% better pdp than 3tsdg based circuits.
beneficial effects of qili qiangxin capsule on lung structural remodeling in ischemic heart failure via tgf-β1/smad3 pathway background cytokine activation in the myocardium of deteriorating patients with heart failure who undergo left ventricular assist-device (lvad) implantation has been documented, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. we hypothesized the innate immune system is activated with expression of toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4), leading to cytokine activation in these patients.   methods we used quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to measure tlr4, interleukin-1 (il-1) receptor, il-1 beta, il-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) mrna expression in myocardial samples from 36 patients. we compared 18 patients who underwent lvad implantation with 18 patients with less severe heart failure who underwent elective heart transplantation.   results toll-like receptor 4 expression was 1.69-fold greater (p < 0.05) and il-1 receptor expression was 3.64-fold greater (p < 0.0001) in the deteriorating patients who required lvads. myocardial tnf-alpha (1.71-fold, p < 0.05), il-6 (2.57-fold, p < 0.005), and il-1 beta (9.78-fold, p < 0.001) also were increased in the lvad candidates. toll-like receptor 4 expression correlated strongly with il-1 receptor expression (r= 0.75, p < 0.0001) and with il-1 beta expression in individual patients (r = 0.7, p < 0.0001). interleukin-1 receptor expression also correlated with il-1 beta expression (r = 0.78, p < 0.0001) within patients. we found no correlation between tlr4 and either tnf-alpha or il-6 expression.   conclusions patients who required lvad support showed evidence of innate immune system activation, indicated by an increase in the key effector molecule tlr4 associated with a specific pattern of cytokine expression in the myocardium.
hospitalizations of older patients with human immunodeficiency virus in the united states. objectives: to alert persons in the public and private healthcare professions to the increasing trends in higher proportions of persons aged 50 and older who are newly diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and who are living with hiv and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids).
adaptive evolution of the venom-targeted vwf protein in opossums that eat pitvipers the ligand binding site of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (acchor) is localized in the alpha-subunit within a domain containing the tandem cys-192 and -193. by analyzing the binding-site region of acchor from animal species that are resistant to alpha-neurotoxins, we have previously shown that four residues in this region, at positions 187, 189, 194, and 197, differ between animals sensitive (e.g., mouse) and resistant (e.g., mongoose and snake) to alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-btx). in the present study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on a fragment of the mongoose acchor alpha-subunit (residues 122-205) and exchanged residues 187, 189, 194, and 197, either alone or in combination, with those present in the mouse alpha-subunit sequence. only the mongoose fragment in which all four residues were mutated to the mouse ones exhibited alpha-btx binding similar to that of the mouse fragment. the mongoose double mutation in which leu-194 and his-197 were replaced with proline residues, which are present at these positions in the mouse acchor and in all other toxin binders, bound alpha-btx to approximately 60% of the level of binding exhibited by the mouse fragment. in addition, replacement of either pro-194 or -197 in the mouse fragment with serine and histidine, respectively, markedly decreased alpha-btx binding. all other mutations resulted in no or just a small increase in alpha-btx binding. these results have led us to propose two subsites in the binding domain for alpha-btx: the proline subsite, which includes pro-194 and -197 and is critical for alpha-btx binding, and the aromatic subsite, which includes amino acid residues 187 and 189 and determines the extent of alpha-btx binding.
behavior based dependability estimation - estimating the dependability of autonomous mobile systems using predictive filter dependability is widely understood as an integrated concept that consists of different attributes. the set of attributes and requirements of each attribute varies from application to application thus making it very challenging to define dependability for a broad amount of application. the dependability, however, is of great importance when dealing with autonomous or semi-autonomous systems, thus defining dependability for those kind of system is vital. such autonomous mobile system are usually described by their behavior. in this paper a minimum set of attributes for the dependability of autonomous mobile systems is proposed based on a behavioral definition of dependability.
highly specific detection of myostatin prodomain by an immunoradiometric sandwich assay in serum of healthy individuals and patients humoral and tumoral factors collectively promote cancer-induced skeletal muscle wasting by increasing protein degradation. although several humoral proteins, namely tnfα (tumour necrosis factor α) and il (interleukin)-6, have been shown to induce skeletal muscle wasting, there is a lack of information regarding the tumoral factors that contribute to the atrophy of muscle during cancer cachexia. therefore, in the present study, we have characterized the secretome of c26 colon cancer cells to identify the tumoral factors involved in cancer-induced skeletal muscle wasting. in the present study, we show that myostatin, a procachectic tgfβ (transforming growth factor β) superfamily member, is abundantly secreted by c26 cells. consistent with myostatin signalling during cachexia, treating differentiated c2c12 myotubes with c26 cm (conditioned medium) resulted in myotubular atrophy due to the up-regulation of muscle-specific e3 ligases, atrogin-1 and murf1 (muscle ring-finger protein 1), and enhanced activity of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. furthermore, the c26 cm also activated actriib (activin receptor type ii b)/smad and nf-κb (nuclear factor κb) signalling, and reduced the activity of the igf-i (insulin-like growth factor 1)/pi3k (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/akt pathway, three salient molecular features of myostatin action in skeletal muscles. antagonists to myostatin prevented c26 cm-induced wasting in muscle cell cultures, further confirming that tumoral myostatin may be a key contributor in the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia. finally, we show that treatment with c26 cm induced the autophagy–lysosome pathway and reduced the number of mitochondria in myotubes. these two previously unreported observations were recapitulated in skeletal muscles collected from c26 tumour-bearing mice.
preventive effect of aminoguanidine compared to vitamin e and c on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. the effect of aminoguanidine (ag) on nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin (cddp) was investigated. a single dose of cddp (7.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced nephrotoxicity, manifested biochemically by a significant elevation in serum urea, creatinine and a severe decrease in serum albumin. moreover, marked increases in kidney weight, urine volume and urinary excretion of albumin were observed. nephrotoxicity was further confirmed by a significant decrease in glutathione-s-transferase (gst, e.c. 2.5.1.18), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px, e.c. 1.11.1.9) and catalase (e.c. 1.11.1.6) and a significant increase in lipid peroxides measured as malondialdhyde (mda) in kidney homogenates. administration of ag (100 mg/kg per day p.o.) in drinking water 5 days before and 5 days after cddp injection produced a significant protection against nephrotoxicity induced by cddp. the amelioration of nephrotoxicity was evidenced by significant reductions in serum urea and creatinine concentrations. in addition, ag tended to normalize decreased levels of serum albumin. urine volume, urinary excretions of albumin and gst and kidney weight were significantly decreased. moreover, ag prevented the rise of mda and the reduction of gst and gsh-px activities in the kidney. these results suggest that ag has a protective effect on nephrotoxicity induced by cddp and it may therefore improve the therapeutic index of cddp.
hon cheung lee as messengers for calcium mobilization adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( naadp ) cyclic adp-ribose and nicotinic acid objective—glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) increases intracellular ca2+ concentrations ([ca2+]i), resulting in insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. the molecular mechanism(s) of the glp-1–mediated regulation of [ca2+]i was investigated. research design and methods—glp-1–induced changes in [ca2+]i were measured in β-cells isolated from cd38+/+ and cd38−/− mice. calcium-mobilizing second messengers were identified by measuring levels of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (naadp) and cyclic adp-ribose (adpr), using a cyclic enzymatic assay. to locate naadp- and cyclic adpr–producing enzyme(s), cellular organelles were separated using the sucrose gradient method. results—a glp-1–induced [ca2+]i increase showed a cooperative ca2+ signal, i.e., an initial [ca2+]i rise mediated by the action of naadp that was produced in acidic organelles and a subsequent long-lasting increase of [ca2+]i by the action of cyclic adpr that was produced in plasma membranes and secretory granules. glp-1 sequentially stimulated production of naadp and cyclic adpr in the organelles through protein kinase a and camp-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor ii. furthermore, the results showed that naadp production from acidic organelles governed overall ca2+ signals, including insulin secretion by glp-1, and that in addition to cd38, enzymes capable of synthesizing naadp and/or cyclic adpr were present in β-cells. these observations were supported by the study with cd38−/− β-cells, demonstrating production of naadp, cyclic adpr, and ca2+ signal with normal insulin secretion stimulated by glp-1. conclusions—our findings demonstrate that the glp-1–mediated ca2+ signal for insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells is a cooperative action of naadp and cyclic adpr spatiotemporally formed by multiple enzymes.
object tracking using local multiple features and a posterior probability measure template matching is one of the principle techniques in visual tracking. various similarity measures have been developed to find the target in an acquired image by matching with a template. however, mismatching or misidentification may sporadically occur due to the influence of the background pixels included in the designated target model. taking into account the statistical features of a search region, a novel similarity measure is proposed, which can decrease the interference of the background pixels enclosed in the model. it highlights the significant target features and at the same time reduces the influence of the features shared by both the target and the background. it exhibits an excellent monotonic property and a distinct peak-like distribution. this new measure is also demonstrated to have a direct interpretation of posterior probability and is named as posterior probability measure (ppm). the proposed ppm can be obtained through a pixel-wise computation and exhibits suitability for image matching. the pixel-wise computation also enables a fast measure update after a target region has changed, which results in a new adaptive scaling method for tracking a target with a varying size. experiments show that it provides a higher precision in the localization and a discriminatory power superior to the existing similarity measures, such as bhattacharyya coefficient, kullback-leibler divergence, and normalized cross correlation. the effectiveness of the adaptive scaling method is demonstrated in experiments.
human papillomavirus knowledge and awareness among vietnamese mothers purpose recent increases in incidence and survival of oropharyngeal cancers in the united states have been attributed to human papillomavirus (hpv) infection, but empirical evidence is lacking.   patients and methods hpv status was determined for all 271 oropharyngeal cancers (1984-2004) collected by the three population-based cancer registries in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) residual tissue repositories program by using polymerase chain reaction and genotyping (inno-lipa), hpv16 viral load, and hpv16 mrna expression. trends in hpv prevalence across four calendar periods were estimated by using logistic regression. observed hpv prevalence was reweighted to all oropharyngeal cancers within the cancer registries to account for nonrandom selection and to calculate incidence trends. survival of hpv-positive and hpv-negative patients was compared by using kaplan-meier and multivariable cox regression analyses.   results hpv prevalence in oropharyngeal cancers significantly increased over calendar time regardless of hpv detection assay (p trend < .05). for example, hpv prevalence by inno-lipa increased from 16.3% during 1984 to 1989 to 71.7% during 2000 to 2004. median survival was significantly longer for hpv-positive than for hpv-negative patients (131 v 20 months; log-rank p < .001; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% ci, 0.21 to 0.46). survival significantly increased across calendar periods for hpv-positive (p = .003) but not for hpv-negative patients (p = .18). population-level incidence of hpv-positive oropharyngeal cancers increased by 225% (95% ci, 208% to 242%) from 1988 to 2004 (from 0.8 per 100,000 to 2.6 per 100,000), and incidence for hpv-negative cancers declined by 50% (95% ci, 47% to 53%; from 2.0 per 100,000 to 1.0 per 100,000). if recent incidence trends continue, the annual number of hpv-positive oropharyngeal cancers is expected to surpass the annual number of cervical cancers by the year 2020.   conclusion increases in the population-level incidence and survival of oropharyngeal cancers in the united states since 1984 are caused by hpv infection.
cadmium induces nuclear translocation of β-catenin and increases expression of c-myc and abcb1a in kidney proximal tubule cells cadherins and other cell–substrate and cell–cell adhesion molecules play an essential role during development. through their cytoplasmic interaction with the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion molecules physically link cells with the extracellular matrix and/or with each other. these interactions create architectural and structural entities that enable the tissues in the embryo to restrain the physical forces encountered during development. regulated cell adhesion is also often the driving force of morphogenetic movements. this review goes beyond the adhesive aspect of cadherins, focusing on their roles as signaling molecules in development. we discuss how cadherins, through their effects on cell proliferation, cell death, cell polarization, and differentiation, play a role in the formation of tissues and organs in the developing embryo. bioessays 21:211–220, 1999. © 1999 john wiley & sons, inc.
germinal center selection and affinity maturation require dynamic regulation of mtorc1 kinase b cells have a need for speed high-affinity antibodies provide long-lasting protective immunity against many infections. generating such antibodies requires help, in the form of t cells, which interact with antibody-producing b cells. as b cells proliferate and mutate their antibody genes, t cells select the cells producing high-affinity antibodies. gitlin et al. show in mice that b cells that receive t cell help transit through the cell cycle more quickly by increasing the speed at which replication forks progress. such a rapid cell cycle transition gives high-affinity b cells a selective advantage. science, this issue p. 643 t cells help select high-affinity antibodies by increasing the speed at which b cells progress through the cell cycle. the germinal center (gc) is a microanatomical compartment wherein high-affinity antibody-producing b cells are selectively expanded. b cells proliferate and mutate their antibody genes in the dark zone (dz) of the gc and are then selected by t cells in the light zone (lz) on the basis of affinity. here, we show that t cell help regulates the speed of cell cycle phase transitions and dna replication of gc b cells. genome sequencing and single-molecule analyses revealed that t cell help shortens s phase by regulating replication fork progression, while preserving the relative order of replication origin activation. thus, high-affinity gc b cells are selected by a mechanism that involves prolonged dwell time in the dz where selected cells undergo accelerated cell cycles.
hypertension and its association with the severity of chronic periodontitis : a preliminary study chronic periodontitis is a common inflammatory disorder that is being contemplated as a risk factor for atherosclerotic complications. current epidemiological evidence also supports its potential association with increases in blood pressure levels and hypertension prevalence. furthermore, data from cross-sectional studies suggest that in hypertensive subjects periodontitis may enhance the risk and degree of target organ damage. a possible pathogenetic background of an effect of periodontitis on blood pressure should include the systemic generalization of the local oral inflammation, the role of the host immune response, the direct microbial effect on the vascular system and alterations in endothelial function. inversely, the concept of hypertension unfavorably affecting periodontal tissues cannot be excluded. the two conditions share multiple common risk factors that should be readily controlled for when assessing a possible association. thoroughly designed prospective and interventional trials are needed in order to determine the impact of periodontitis on blood pressure regulation and incident hypertension and its integration in the clinical approach of both dental and hypertensive patients.
incentive human-to-human chat support protocol the rapid growth of decentralized and unstructured peer-topeer (p2p) networks [3, 7] points to a new efficient paradigm for information exchange on the internet. a p2p network may exhibit a power-law topology [5] such that it can propagate queries quickly and, if implemented efficiently [7], it can locate objects in time, where is the number of nodes in the network. however, there are remaining problems with the p2p paradigm which complicates its deployment. freeriding and tragedy of the commons are two major problems. as shown in [1], nearly 70% of gnutella users do not share any file with the p2p community and nearly 50% of all search responses come from the top 1% of content sharing nodes. therefore, nodes that share resources are always congested and the tragedy of the commons [2] occurs. another problem is that many users misreport their connection types so as to discourage others from going to their sites for file download. worse yet, there is no service differentiation between users who do not share any information and users who contribute significantly to the p2p community. the objective of this paper is to design a mechanism that provides incentives for users to share information and offers preferential service to users who contribute to the p2p community. in particular, we address the following questions:
swimming behavior and velocities of barnacle cyprids in a downwelling flume field observations imply that accumulation and advection of invertebrate larvae and other plankton by propagating fronts provides an efficient mechanism for the cross-shelf transport and subsequent coastal settlement of larvae and plankton. gravity currents propagating into a heavier, uniform-density fluid are known to have near-surface velocities u that exceed the propagation speed c of the gravity current nose. it is shown by simple dam-break laboratory experiments and through corresponding numerical solutions of two-dimensional stratified flow and lagrangian particle advection that this characteristic of gravity currents can lead to accumulation in the gravity current nose of particles that originate well behind the gravity current head. however, efficient particle accumulation and transport with the speed c only occurs for particles with sufficient vertical buoyancy or vertical swimming capability. weakly buoyant or neutral particles are swept down and back away from the gravity current head by the circulation in this region. a dam break into an ambient fluid with stratification (two-layered) could result in the transport of some particles that are initially trapped in the forepart of the leading disturbance, an undular bore. however, this situation does not result in significant accumulation of particles at the leading edge of the disturbance. the numerical solutions show that particles that originate in the dense fluid ahead of the gravity current are much less likely to be accumulated at the gravity current nose. a simple scaling criterion for the minimum vertical buoyancy velocity for efficient accumulation and transport of buoyant particles based on the gravity current and particle characteristics is developed and compares favorably with the numerical results. the implications of these results for transport of larvae in coastal environments are discussed. the dynamics of marine benthic invertebrate populations are greatly affected by larval transport. for near-shore populations, larval transport prior to settlement includes at least three processes: cross-shore advection, because larvae are generally very small and cannot control their cross-shore position by swimming alone; larval behavior, because by swimming vertically, larvae might be able to exploit some depth-dependent cross-shore flows; and accumulation by convergent circulation in propagating features, because cross-shore advection of larvae is often dependent on the retention of larvae at the propagating features. several hypotheses of onshore larval transport, namely surface slicks over linear internal waves (shanks 1983), internal bore warm fronts (pineda 1994), and upwelling relaxation fronts (farrell et al. 1991), invoke concentration of larvae at propagating features. these hypotheses state that larvae become concentrated at convergent features aligned parallel to the coastline and that larval transport occurs as these linear features propagate shoreward. the interplay between transport and accumulation is poorly understood; issues include (1) the dependency of transport on accumulation, and of accumulation on larval behavior, and (2) whether the frontal larvae originate onshore or off
word clarity as a metric in sampling keyboard test sets in text entry experiments, memorability is a desired property of the phrases used as stimuli. unfortunately, to date there is no automated method to achieve this effect. as a result, researchers have to use either manually curated english-only phrase sets or sampling procedures that do not guarantee phrases being memorable. in response to this need, we present a novel sampling method based on two core ideas: a multiple regression model over language-independent features, and the statistical analysis of the corpus from which phrases will be drawn. our results show that researchers can finally use a method to successfully curate their own stimuli targeting potentially any language or domain. the source code as well as our phrase sets are publicly available.
the roadmap relapse prevention group counseling toolkit™: counselor adherence and competence outcomes. we evaluated a 2-day training workshop on motivational interviewing (mi) for addiction and mental health clinicians (n = 22). clinicians completed the helpful responses questionnaire (hrq) and taped interactions with a standardized patient (sp). independent, blinded coders rated the tapes using the motivational interviewing skills code (misc). post-training assessment showed significant increase on the hrq and two of four misc summary scores for sp interviews. at 2-month follow-up, means of the hrq and two misc summary scores remained higher than baseline, but declined from post-training. some mi skills improved to a greater degree than others, and a subset of clinicians (> 40%) showed continued improvement at follow-up. results were consistent across interviews with different sps, supporting the use of this assessment method. findings highlight the need for additional research on the use of standardized patients, alternative assessment techniques, and effective methods of technology transfer for mi skill acquisition and retention.
hsp90 is essential under heat stress in the bacterium shewanella oneidensis. salmonellaenterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium (salmonella typhimurium) contamination of pork, is one of the major sources of human salmonellosis. the bacterium is able to persist and hide in asymptomatic carrier animals, generating a reservoir for salmonella transmission to other animals and humans. mechanisms involved in salmonella persistence in pigs remain poorly understood. in the present study, we demonstrate that the salmonellahtpg gene, encoding a homologue of the eukaryotic heat shock protein 90, contributes to salmonella typhimurium persistence in intestine-associated tissues of pigs, but not in the tonsils. htpg does not seem to play an important role during the acute phase of infection. the contribution to persistence was shown to be associated with htpg-dependent salmonella invasion and survival in porcine enterocytes and macrophages. these results reveal the role of htpg as a virulence factor contributing to salmonella persistence in pigs.
matrix metalloproteinases expressed by astrocytes mediate extracellular amyloid-β peptide catabolism activated macrophages produce several matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), a family of extracellular matrix (ecm)‐degrading enzymes, during wound healing and in other inflammatory states. in response to brain injury, brain microglia become “activated,” in a way similar to peripheral tissue macrophages, a process which includes differentiation and probably invasion and proliferation. little is known about the ecm‐degrading mmps that are secreted by microglia upon activation. thus, it was of interest to determine whether activated microglia secrete mmps. conditioned media samples obtained from cultured microglia that were stimulated with various activating agents were subjected to gelatin‐substrate zymography. microglia constitutively express low levels of a 94‐kda gelatinase (glase) activity. treatment with lps, zymosan, and fixed staphylococcus aureus for 24 hr stimulated the activity of the 94‐kda glase, 4‐20‐fold, in a dose‐dependent manner. addition of infγ inhibited the lps‐stimulated activity of mmp‐9. lps, zymosan, and fixed staphylococcus aureus also stimulated the secretion of il‐6 from microglia in a dose‐dependent manner. the 94‐kda glase activity was ca++ dependent, it was inhibited by 1,10‐phenanthroline, and it was activated by organomercurial compounds. when immunoblots were performed using specific antisera against the 94‐kda gelatinase b (mmp‐9) with untreated and lps‐stimulated conditioned medium samples, a 94‐kda immunopositive band was observed. thus, it appears that the 94‐kda glase is gelatinase b (mmp‐9). these results indicate that activators of peripheral macrophages are potent secretagogues for the mmps in cultured microglia. the ability of activated microglia to secrete mmps suggests that these enzymes may play an important function in the brain parenchyma during inflammatory states. © 1995 wiley‐liss, inc.
increased reactive oxygen species formation and oxidative stress in rheumatoid arthritis abstract this study aims to elucidate plasma oxidant/antioxidant status in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). fasting blood samples were obtained from 24 patients with ra and 20 control subjects. antioxidant potential (aop) value, nonenzymatic superoxide radical scavenger activity (nssa), and malondialdehyde (mda) levels were measured to establish plasma oxidant/antioxidant status in the patient and control groups. patients with ra had lower aop and nssa but higher mda levels than those of the control subjects, which was an indication of reduced antioxidant capacity and oxidant stress in these patients. results suggest that the antioxidant system is impaired and peroxidation reactions are accelerated in patients with ra. we suppose that therapeutic use of some antioxidants may be beneficial in this regard.
degradation of mixtures of phenolic compounds by arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6 abstract arthrobacter chlorophenolicus a6, a previously described 4-chlorophenol-degrading strain, was found to degrade 4-chlorophenol via hydroxyquinol, which is a novel route for aerobic microbial degradation of this compound. in addition, 10 open reading frames exhibiting sequence similarity to genes encoding enzymes involved in chlorophenol degradation were cloned and designated part of a chlorophenol degradation gene cluster (cph genes). several of the open reading frames appeared to encode enzymes with similar functions; these open reading frames included two genes, cpha-i and cpha-ii, which were shown to encode functional hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenases. disruption of the cpha-i gene yielded a mutant that exhibited negligible growth on 4-chlorophenol, thereby linking the cph gene cluster to functional catabolism of 4-chlorophenol in a. chlorophenolicus a6. the presence of a resolvase pseudogene in the cph gene cluster together with analyses of the g+c content and codon bias of flanking genes suggested that horizontal gene transfer was involved in assembly of the gene cluster during evolution of the ability of the strain to grow on 4-chlorophenol.
advanced development of primary pancreatic organoid tumor models for high-throughput phenotypic drug screening it has been >10 years since vogelstein and colleagues [(1][1] [, 2)][2] proposed a progression model for colorectal neoplasia in which they hypothesized that the progression from normal colonic epithelium, to small adenomatous polyps, to infiltrating adenocarcinoma is associated with the activation
high performance work systems: the gap between policy and practice in health care reform. objectives this study aimed to build on the increasing evidence of a link between good people management practice, and organizational and patient outcomes in public health care to document the important human resource management practices in our hospitals. methods the design included large scale survey of hospital managers' perceptions of the use of human resource management practices. the questionnaire included human resource management (hrm) measures and additional questions related to the australian hospital accreditation standards. data were collected in december 2003 until april 2004 from a total sample of 92 hospitals/hospital organizations from the state of victoria, australia. the participants were chief executive officers, human resource directors and two other senior managers of the hospital organizations were invited to complete the questionnaire. there were no interventions. the main outcome measure, one-way analysis of variance was used to determine differences in the perceptions of the three groups of managers' concerning the use of hrm practices. frequency and descriptive statistics were used to determine use of hrm practices. results a 67% response rate enabled us to document human resource management practices in victorian hospitals. the respondents reported limited strategic and organizational hrm. conclusion this study found limited evidence of sophisticated hrm practices among hospitals and hospital organizations in the state of victoria, australia. despite the increasing evidence of a relationship among effective hrm and health-care outcomes, these hospitals reported limited performance management, training and development, and employee empowerment and decision-making. the authors suggest that it is unlikely that attempts to improve patient safety in this sector will be successful until the deficits in hrm are addressed.
adult age differences in the color stroop test: a comparison between an item-by-item and a blocked version. the literature on interference in the stroop color-word task, covering over 50 years and some 400 studies, is organized and reviewed. in so doing, a set of 18 reliable empirical finding is isolated that must be captured by any successful theory of the stroop effect. existing theoretical positions are summarized and evaluated in view of this critical evidence and the 2 major candidate theories ―relative speed of processing and automaticity of reading― are found to be wanting. it is concluded that recent theories placing the explanatory weight on parallel processing of the irrelevant and the relevant dimensions are likely to be more sucessful than are earlier theories attempting to locate a single bottleneck in attention
friends and enemies within: the roles of subgroups, imbalance, and isolates in geographically dispersed teams as organizations operate across greater distances, scholars are increasingly interested in the work of geographically dispersed teams and the technologies that they use to communicate and coordinate their work. however, research has generally not specified the dimensions (spatial, temporal, or configurational) and degrees of team dispersion, nor has it articulated the theoretical connections between those dimensions and important team outcomes. this research essay expands upon previous field and lab studies of dispersed teamwork by presenting a new conceptualization of dispersion as a continuous, multidimensional construct, in which each dimension is theoretically linked with different outcomes. we illustrate this new conceptualization with a series of examples from real dispersed teams and present implications for research regarding technology use.
meanfield modeling of propofol-induced changes in spontaneous eeg rhythms the neuronal mechanisms of general anesthesia are still poorly understood. besides several characteristic features of anesthesia observed in experiments, a prominent effect is the bi-phasic change of power in the observed electroencephalogram (eeg), i.e. the initial increase and subsequent decrease of the eeg-power in several frequency bands while increasing the concentration of the anaesthetic agent. the present work aims to derive analytical conditions for this bi-phasic spectral behavior by the study of a neural population model. this model describes mathematically the effective membrane potential and involves excitatory and inhibitory synapses, excitatory and inhibitory cells, nonlocal spatial interactions and a finite axonal conduction speed. the work derives conditions for synaptic time constants based on experimental results and gives conditions on the resting state stability. further the power spectrum of local field potentials and eeg generated by the neural activity is derived analytically and allow for the detailed study of bi-spectral power changes. we find bi-phasic power changes both in monostable and bistable system regime, affirming the omnipresence of bi-spectral power changes in anesthesia. further the work gives conditions for the strong increase of power in the δ-frequency band for large propofol concentrations as observed in experiments.
analysis of the modulated acoustic radiation-force profile for a dual-beam confocal geometry. we describe theoretical principles of an imaging modality that uses the acoustic response of an object to a highly localized dynamic radiation force of an ultrasound field. in this method, named ultrasound-stimulated vibro-acoustography (usva), ultrasound is used to exert a low-frequency (in khz range) force on the object. in response, a portion of the object vibrates sinusoidally in a pattern determined by its viscoelastic properties. the acoustic emission field resulting from object vibration is detected and used to form an image that represents both the ultrasonic and low-frequency (khz range) mechanical characteristics of the object. we report the relation between the emitted acoustic field and the incident ultrasonic pressure field in terms of object parameters. also, we present the point-spread function of the imaging system. the experimental images in this report have a resolution of about 700 microm, high contrast, and high signal-to-noise ratio. usva is sensitive enough to detect object motions on the order of nanometers. possible applications include medical imaging and material evaluation.
the impact of pri-mir-218 rs11134527 on the risk and prognosis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. more than 275,100 women die from cervical cancer each year. cervical squamous cell carcinoma (cervical scc), one of the most frequent types of cervical cancers, is associated with high-risk human papilloma virus (hpv), although hpv infection alone may not be enough to induce malignant transformation. micrornas (mirnas), a class of small non-coding rnas, regulate protein-coding gene expression by repressing translation or cleaving rna transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. a growing body of evidence suggests that mirnas contribute to cervical scc progression, development and metastasis. mirna expression signatures in scc (hypopharyngeal scc and esophageal scc) revealed that mir-218 expression was significantly reduced in cancer tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous epithelium, suggesting that mir-218 is a candidate tumor suppressor. the aim of this study was to investigate the functional significance of mir-218 in cervical scc and to identify novel mir-218-mediated cancer pathways in cervical scc. restoration of mir-218 significantly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion in both hpv-positive and hpv-negative cervical scc cell lines. these data indicated that mir-218 acts as a tumor suppressor in cervical scc. our in silico analysis showed that mir-218 appeared to be an important modulator of tumor cell processes through suppression of many targets, particularly those involved in focal adhesion signaling pathways. gene expression data indicated that lamb3, a laminin protein known to influence cell differentiation, migration, adhesion, proliferation and survival, was upregulated in cervical scc clinical specimens, and silencing studies demonstrated that lamb3 functioned as an oncogene in cervical scc. the identification of novel tumor-suppressive mir-218-mediated molecular pathways has provided new insights into cervical scc oncogenesis and metastasis.
exclusionary interactions among diverse fungi infecting developing seeds of centaurea stoebe. fungal endophytes are important in plant ecology and common in plants. we attempted to test cointroduction and host-jumping hypotheses on a community basis by comparing endophytes isolated from invasive spotted knapweed (centaurea stoebe, asteraceae) in its native and invaded ranges. of 92 combined, sequence-based haplotypes representing eight classes of fungi, 78 occurred in only one of the two ranges. in the native range of c. stoebe, one haplotype of alternaria alternata was clearly dominant, whereas in the invaded range, no haplotype was dominant. many haplotypes were closely related to one another and novel. for example, six putative, new species of botrytis were discovered as endophytes of c. stoebe, which has never been reported to have botrytis spp.. apparent differences between the two communities of endophytes were significant according to an analysis of similarity, but phylogenetic community structure did not differ significantly between the ranges. both host-jumping and cointroduction of fungal endophytes likely took place during the spotted knapweed invasion.
the role of intestinal oxalate transport in hyperoxaluria and the formation of kidney stones in animals and man active transcellular oxalate transport in the mammalian intestine contributes to the homeostasis of this important lithogenic anion. several members of the slc26a gene family of anion exchangers have a measurable oxalate affinity and are expressed along the gut, apically and basolaterally. mouse slc26a6 (pat1) targets to the apical membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine, and its deletion results in net oxalate absorption and hyperoxaluria. apical exchangers of the slc26a family that mediate oxalate absorption have not been established, yet the slc26a3 [downregulated in adenoma (dra)] protein is a candidate mediator of oxalate uptake. we evaluated the role of dra in intestinal oxalate and cl(-) transport by comparing unidirectional and net ion fluxes across short-circuited segments of small (ileum) and large (cecum and distal colon) intestine from wild-type (wt) and dra knockout (ko) mice. in wt mice, all segments demonstrated net oxalate and cl(-) absorption to varying degrees. in ko mice, however, all segments exhibited net anion secretion, which was consistently, and solely, due to a significant reduction in the absorptive unidirectional fluxes. in ko mice, daily urinary oxalate excretion was reduced 66% compared with that in wt mice, while urinary creatinine excretion was unchanged. we conclude that dra mediates a predominance of the apical uptake of oxalate and cl(-) absorbed in the small and large intestine of mice under short-circuit conditions. the large reductions in urinary oxalate excretion underscore the importance of transcellular intestinal oxalate absorption, in general, and, more specifically, the importance of the dra exchanger in oxalate homeostasis.
common culture conditions for maintenance and cardiomyocyte differentiation of the human embryonic stem cell lines, bg01 and hues-7. this report, first published online on march 3, 2004, discusses the procedures used to develop 17 lines of human embryonic stem cells from the inner cell masses of blastocysts. these cell lines are available to researchers under a material transfer agreement; according to current regulations, the cells cannot be used for research supported by federal funds. these cells are expected to facilitate research on a variety of serious chronic diseases.
distinct regions control transcriptional activation of the alpha1(vi) collagen promoter in different tissues of transgenic mice the expression of type vi collagen has been studied in mouse tissues. by northern blotting, the mrna for the alpha 1 (vi) chain was detectable in whole embryos at 10.5 days postcoitum and steeply increased afterward. the messenger levels were high at birth, but decreased rapidly in the following days, reaching low levels in adult animals. in 2-month-old mice, lung, skin, adrenal gland, heart, skeletal muscle and tail and fat were among the most active producers of alpha 1 (vi) mrna. in situ hybridization first identified mrna for alpha 1 (vi) collagen in mesenchymal cells of 10.5-day embryos in various locations, including serosae, branchial arches, large blood vessels and the cephalic mesenchyme. staining increased at later stages of development and most connective tissues were positive at 16.5 days and later. strongly staining tissues were joints, intervertebral disks, perichondrium, periostium, dermis, skeletal muscle and heart valves, whereas cartilage and bone were very poorly labelled. epithelia and the central nervous system were completely negative. in several organs, notably lung, salivary glands and the digestive tract, staining was concentrated underneath epithelia. this staining pattern was different from that for collagen type i, which was evenly distributed in the subepithelial mesenchyme. the pattern of distribution of the protein, revealed by immunocytochemistry, was coincident with that of the alpha 1 (vi) mrna. in addition, the results confirmed that type vi collagen is preferentially deposited in the pericellular environment. this was particularly evident in skeletal muscle. the data show that type vi collagen is mainly produced by mesenchymal cells and suggest a role for the protein in delineating the boundary of distinct domains in connective tissue.
socs36e limits stat signaling via cullin2 and a socs-box independent mechanism in the drosophila egg chamber patterns of cell fates generated by morphogens are critically important for normal development; however, the mechanisms by which graded morphogen signals are converted into all-or-none cell fate responses are incompletely understood. in the drosophila ovary, high and sustained levels of the secreted morphogen unpaired (upd) specify the migratory border-cell population by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat). a lower or transient level of stat activity specifies a non-migratory population of follicle cells. here we identify mir-279 as a component of a feedback pathway that further dampens the response in cells with low levels of jak/stat activity. mir-279 directly repressed stat, and loss of mir-279 mimicked stat gain-of-function or loss of apontic (apt), a known feedback inhibitor of stat. apt was essential for mir-279 expression in non-migratory follicle cells, whereas another stat target, ken and barbie (ken), downregulated mir-279 in border cells. mathematical modelling and simulations of this regulatory circuit including mir-279, apt and ken supported key roles for mir-279 and apt in generating threshold responses to the upd gradient.
increased rostral anterior cingulate activity following positive mental imagery training in healthy older adults we can imagine looking at ourselves (observer perspective) or through our own eyes (field perspective). cognitive and clinical theories suggest that compared to field perspective, observer perspective imagery reduces emotional intensity, for example, of trauma memories. tests of causality are lacking and less is known about perspective and positive emotion. using contrasting experimental manipulations, participants imagined 100 positive descriptions from either (1) a field perspective or (2) an observer perspective, or (3) thought about their verbal meaning. affect was more positive after field than observer imagery and verbal conditions, with mood deterioration within the latter two. findings are the first to demonstrate causality of imagery perspective on emotion. further, the results demonstrate that imagining positive events from one's own perspective is critical to improving positive affect. treatment implications include promoting field imagery to facilitate a more rose-tinted view of positive events.
potential for multiple mechanisms, phenomena and algorithms for synaptic plasticity at single synapses experience-dependent potentiation and depression of synaptic strength has been proposed to subserve learning and memory by changing the gain of signals conveyed between neurons1,2. here we examine synaptic plasticity between individual neocortical layer-5 pyramidal neurons. we show that an increase in the synaptic response, induced by pairing action-potential activity in pre- and postsynaptic neurons, was only observed when synaptic input occurred at low frequencies. this frequency-dependent increase in synaptic responses arises because of a redistribution of the available synaptic efficacy and not because of an increase in the efficacy. redistribution of synaptic efficacy could represent a mechanism to change the content, rather than the gain, of signals conveyed between neurons.
modulating the folding of p-glycoprotein and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator truncation mutants with pharmacological chaperones the most common cause of cystic fibrosis (cf) is deletion of phenylalanine 508 (deltaf508) in the cf transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) chloride channel. the deltaf508 mutation produces defects in folding, stability, and channel gating. to identify small-molecule correctors of defective cellular processing, we assayed iodide flux in deltaf508-cftr-transfected epithelial cells using a fluorescent halide indicator. screening of 150,000 chemically diverse compounds and more than 1,500 analogs of active compounds yielded several classes of deltaf508-cftr correctors (aminoarylthiazoles, quinazolinylaminopyrimidinones, and bisaminomethylbithiazoles) with micromolar potency that produced greater apical membrane chloride current than did low-temperature rescue. correction was seen within 3-6 hours and persisted for more than 12 hours after washout. functional correction was correlated with plasma membrane expression of complex-glycosylated deltaf508-cftr protein. biochemical studies suggested a mechanism of action involving improved deltaf508-cftr folding at the er and stability at the cell surface. the bisaminomethylbithiazoles corrected deltaf508-cftr in deltaf508/deltaf508 human bronchial epithelia but did not correct a different temperature-sensitive cftr mutant (p574h-cftr) or a dopamine receptor mutant. small-molecule correctors may be useful in the treatment of cf caused by the deltaf508 mutation.
interstitial f(2)-isoprostane 8-iso-pgf(2α) as a biomarker of oxidative stress after severe human traumatic brain injury. mammalian cells express a transport system known as system xc−, which is an exchange agency specific for anionic forms of cystine and glutamate. system xc− activity is important to maintain both intracellular glutathione levels and the redox balance between cystine and cysteine in the extracellular milieu. we have shown that the cloned cdnas encoding the transporter for system xc− consist of two components, xct and the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen. in the present study, we have investigated the mrna distribution for these components in the mouse brain by in situ hybridization. the xct mrna was expressed in the area postrema, subfornical organ, habenular nucleus, hypothalamic area, and ependymal cells of the lateral wall of the third ventricle in the adult mouse brain. a strong signal was also detected in the meninges in both adult and fetal mouse brains. the mrna expression of the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen was detected in a more broad area, including all of the regions in which xct mrna was detected. these data are compatible with our biochemical evidence that xct functions in combination with the heavy chain of 4f2 antigen to elicit system xc− activity. the expression of system xc− in meninges and some circumventricular organs may suggest that this transporter contributes to the maintenance of the redox state (i.e., cysteine/cystine ratio) in the csf.
a quantitative examination of the intellectual profile and evolution of information security from 1965 to 2015 despite increasing awareness of the need to trace the trajectory of innovation system research, so far little attention has been given to quantitative depiction of the evolution of this fast-moving research field. this paper uses citespace to demonstrate visually intellectual structures and developments. the study uses citation analysis to detect and visualize disciplinary distributions, keyword co-word networks and journal cocitation networks, highly cited references, as well as highly cited authors to identify intellectual turning points, pivotal points and emerging trends, in innovation systems system research from 1975 to 2012.
macular pigment density at the site of altered fundus autofluorescence purpose to image and quantify the spatial distribution of fundus autofluorescence in normal subjects, to determine its age dependence, and to document the deviation from normal in patients with age-related macular disease.   methods using a confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (clso), the intensity and spatial distribution of fundus autofluorescence was studied in 33 normal subjects, 97 eyes with drusen only, and 111 eyes with visual loss caused by age-related macular disease.   results fundus autofluorescence intensity in normal subjects was highest at the posterior pole and dipped at the fovea. autofluorescence increased with age at the posterior pole. fundus in eyes with age-related maculopathy showed localized high autofluorescence that did not correspond with drusen. linear pigmentation at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (rpe), whether detached or flat, fluoresced brightly, whereas plaques of melanin did not. areas of low and high levels of autofluorescence were seen in lesions containing choroidal new vessels. in areas of geographic atrophy, autofluorescence was low.   conclusions the spatial distribution of background fundus autofluorescence and the correlation of autofluorescence with age in normal subjects imply that autofluorescence is derived from lipofuscin at the level of the rpe. focal accumulation of autofluorescent material occurs at the level of the rpe in patients with drusen, but the drusen do not show marked increases in autofluorescence. it is likely that melanolipofuscin accounts for the high levels of autofluorescence, corresponding to linear pigmentation at the level of the rpe. low-intensity autofluorescence occurs in the presence of retinal photoreceptor loss, and variable levels over disciform lesions probably relate to variations in metabolic activity of the rpe.
living close to a person with cancer: a review of the international literature and implications for social work practice the current study examined whether adult children of recently diagnosed breast cancer patients experience heightened general and major stressor-related distress, and identified a potential mediator between these two forms of distress. unique from other stress studies, the current study proposed a novel intrapsychic construct, the extent to which one understands and recognizes his or her thoughts and feelings related to a major stressor, for which we coined the term cognitive and emotional coherence. albeit preliminary, findings supported study hypotheses and argue that this construct may represent an important mediator of distress as well as a pivotal target for psychosocial intervention.
a preliminary investigation of cognitive appraisal and cardiovascular reactivity and recovery in arab americans. problem/condition the u.s. population continues to diversify, and certain racial/ethnic minorities are growing at a substantially more rapid pace than the majority population. limited large-scale population-based surveys and surveillance systems are designed to monitor the health status of minority populations. the racial and ethnic approaches to community health (reach) 2010 risk factor survey is conducted annually in minority communities in the united states. the survey focuses on four minority populations (blacks, hispanics, asians/pacific islanders [a/pis], and american indians).   reporting period covered 2001-2002.   description of system telephone (n = 18 communities) and face-to-face (n = 3 communities) interviews were conducted in 21 communities located in 14 states (alabama, california, georgia, illinois, louisiana, massachusetts, michigan, new york, north carolina, oklahoma, south carolina, tennessee, texas, and washington). an average of 1,000 minority residents aged >/=18 years in each community was sampled. interviews were administered in english, spanish, vietnamese, khmer, or mandarin chinese. the median response rate for household screenings was 74.0% for households that were reached and 72.0% for family members interviewed. the self-reported data from the community were compared with data derived from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system (brfss) for the metropolitan/micropolitan statistical area (mmsa) or the state where the community was located and compared with national estimates from brfss.   results reported education level and household income were markedly lower in minority communities than the general population living in the comparison mmsa or state. more minorities reported being in fair or poor health, but they did not see a doctor because of the cost. substantial variations were observed in the prevalence of health-risk factors and selected chronic conditions among minority populations and in communities within the same racial/ethnic minority. the median prevalence of obesity among a/pi men and women was 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively, whereas 39.2% and 37.5% of american indian men and women were obese, respectively. cigarette smoking was common in american indian communities, with a median of 42.2% for men and 36.7% for women. compared with the national level, fewer minority adults reported eating >/=5 fruits and vegetables daily and met recommendations for moderate or vigorous leisure-time physical activity. american indian communities had a high prevalence of self-reported cardiovascular disease, hypertension, high blood cholesterol, and diabetes. a high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes was also observed in black communities (32.0% and 10.9%, respectively, for men and 40.4% and 14.3%, respectively, for women). compared with the general u.s. population, a substantially lower percentage of hispanics and a/pis had reported receiving preventive services (e.g., cholesterol screenings; glycosylated hemoglobin tests and foot examinations for patients with diabetes; mammograms and papanicolaou smear tests; and vaccination for influenza and pneumonia among adults aged >/=65 years).   interpretation data from the reach 2010 risk factor survey demonstrate that residents in the minority communities bear greater risks for disease compared with the general population living in the same mmsa or state. substantial variations in the prevalence of risk factors, chronic conditions, and use of preventive services among different minority populations and in communities within the same racial/ethnic population provide opportunities for public health interventions. these variations also indicate that different racial/ethnic populations and different communities should have different priorities in eliminating health disparities.   public health actions the continuous surveillance of health status in minority communities is necessary so that culturally sensitive prevention strategies can be tailored to these communities and program interventions evaluated.
demanding innovation : the impact of consumer subsidies on solar panel production costs ∗ this paper estimates demand for residential solar photovoltaic (pv) systems using a new approach to address three empirical challenges that often arise with count data: excess zeros, unobserved heterogeneity, and endogeneity of price. our results imply a price elasticity of demand for solar pv systems of −0.65. counterfactual policy simulations indicate that reducing state financial incentives in half would have led to 9% fewer new installations in connecticut in 2014. calculations suggest a subsidy program cost of $364/tco2 assuming solar displaces natural gas. our poisson hurdle approach holds promise for modeling the demand for many new technologies.
continuous mild heat stress induces differentiation of mammalian myoblasts, shifting fiber type from fast to slow. satellite cell proliferation was assessed in low-frequency-stimulated hypothyroid rat fast-twitch muscle by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (brdu) labeling and subsequent staining of labeled muscle nuclei, and by staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna). brdu labeling and pcna staining were highly correlated and increased approximately fourfold at 5 days of stimulation, decayed thereafter, but remained elevated over control in 10- and 20-day stimulated muscles. myogenin mrna was approximately 4-fold elevated at 5 days and 1.5-fold at 10 days. staining for myogenin protein yielded results similar to that for pcna and brdu. furthermore, a detailed examination of the pattern of myogenin staining revealed that the number of myogenin-positive nuclei was elevated in the fast pure iib fiber population at 5 and 10 days of chronic low-frequency stimulation. by 20 days, myogenin staining was observed in transforming fast fibers that coexpressed embryonic and adult myosin heavy chain isoforms. in the slower fiber populations (i.e., iia and i), myogenin-positive transforming fibers that coexpressed embryonic myosin heavy chain, appeared already at 5 days. thus the satellite cell progeny on slower fibers seemed to proliferate less and to fuse earlier to their associated fibers than the satellite cell progeny on fast fibers. we suggest that the increase in muscle nuclei of the fast fibers might be a prerequisite for fast-to-slow fiber type transitions.
interlimb coordination in patients with parkinson’s disease: motor learning deficits and the importance of augmented information feedback normal voluntary movements are considered to be of two kinds, or to involve two components, (i) a ballistic or "open-loop" type, which are preprogrammed and executed without reference to current sensory information and (ii) a corrective or "closed-loop" type, whose course or termination are regulated by such information. in a previous paper it was suggested that parkinsonism disrupted the first kind of movement, but intention tremor did not. in the present paper three experiments designed to test this hypothesis are described. subjects were tested on an acquisition-tracking task using an oscilloscope display and joystick control, and measurements were made of the duration, velocity and error of their initial movements to acquire the target. parkinsonian movements were found to be considerably different from normal in that (a) most movements by this group lasted longer than the reaction time for their initiation, as if including some secondary correction in their execution, (b) the rate of movement was not varied for different amplitudes (so keeping the duration fairly constant) as in normal subjects, but rather movements of all amplitudes were made at a constant slow rate, so that duration increased markedly with the larger steps, (c) error increased disproportionately as the velocity of movement increased; in particular any movements completed in one reaction time or less tended to be wildly inaccurate, (d) removing either the target or the response marker from the screen at the beginning of a movement had a significant effect, making it shorter in duration and smaller in amplitude than those usually produced with both markers visible all the time. parkinsonian subjects showed no improvement in performance with repeated attempts at one movement over a whole sequence, so their deficit appears to be stable even after practice on a known fixed task. these results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that parkinsonism interferes with the generation of accurate ballistic action which are characteristic of normal skilled movement. tremor subjects in general resembled normal control subjects in their initial acquistion movements, but their accuracy was less with the larger steps.
a conserved polϵ binding module in ctf18-rfc is required for s-phase checkpoint activation downstream of mec1 the s phase checkpoint pathway preserves genome stability by protecting defective dna replication forks, but the underlying mechanisms are still understood poorly. previous work with budding yeast suggested that the checkpoint kinases mec1 and rad53 might prevent collapse of the replisome when nucleotide concentrations are limiting, thereby allowing the subsequent resumption of dna synthesis. here we describe a direct analysis of replisome stability in budding yeast cells lacking checkpoint kinases, together with a high-resolution view of replisome progression across the genome. surprisingly, we find that the replisome is stably associated with dna replication forks following replication stress in the absence of mec1 or rad53. a component of the replicative dna helicase is phosphorylated within the replisome in a mec1-dependent manner upon replication stress, and our data indicate that checkpoint kinases control replisome function rather than stability, as part of a multifaceted response that allows cells to survive defects in chromosome replication.
spatio-temporal cellular dynamics of the arabidopsis flagellin receptor reveal activation status-dependent endosomal sorting[c][w] actin and myosin are components of plasmodesmata, the cytoplasmic channels between plant cells, but their role in regulating these channels is unclear. here, we investigated the role of myosin in regulating plasmodesmata in a well-studied, simple system comprising single filaments of cells which form stamen hairs in tradescantia virginiana flowers. effects of myosin inhibitors were assessed by analysing cell-to-cell movement of fluorescent tracers microinjected into treated cells. incubation in the myosin inhibitor, 2,3-butanedione monoxime (bdm) or injection of anti-myosin antibodies increased cell–cell transport of fluorescent dextrans, while treatment with the myosin inhibitor n-ethylmaleimide (nem) decreased cell–cell transport. pretreatment with the callose synthesis inhibitor, deoxy-d-glucose (ddg), enhanced transport induced by bdm treatment or injection of myosin antibodies but did not relieve nem-induced reduction in transport. in contrast to the myosin inhibitors, cell-to-cell transport was unaffected by treatment with the actin polymerisation inhibitor, latrunculin b, after controlling for callose synthesis with ddg. transport was increased following azide treatment, and reduced after injection of atp, as in previous studies. we propose that myosin detachment from actin, induced by bdm, opens t. virginiana plasmodesmata whereas the firm attachment of myosin to actin, promoted by nem, closes them.
trends in the hiv epidemic among african american men who have sex with men, san francisco, 2004–2011 understanding infectious disease dynamics and the effect on prevalence and incidence is crucial for public health policies. disease incidence and prevalence are typically not observed directly and increasingly are estimated through the synthesis of indirect information from multiple data sources. we demonstrate how an evidence synthesis approach to the estimation of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) prevalence in england and wales can be extended to infer the underlying hiv incidence. diverse time series of data can be used to obtain yearly “snapshots” (with associated uncertainty) of the proportion of the population in 4 compartments: not at risk, susceptible, hiv positive but undiagnosed, and diagnosed hiv positive. a multistate model for the infection and diagnosis processes is then formulated by expressing the changes in these proportions by a system of differential equations. by parameterizing incidence in terms of prevalence and contact rates, hiv transmission is further modeled. use of additional data or prior information on demographics, risk behavior change and contact parameters allows simultaneous estimation of the transition rates, compartment prevalences, contact rates, and transmission probabilities.
pupillary function in early multiple sclerosis there is evidence that the clinical course of multiple sclerosis is age related. the present study evaluated the relationship between age and rate of disability progression in a large hospital‐based cohort of definite cases of multiple sclerosis (n= 1,463). patients were followed every 6 to 12 months for a total period of observation of 11,387.8 person‐years. expanded disability status scale scores increased significantly with increasing current age and longer duration of disease (p=0.007). median times to reach expanded disability status scale scores of 4.0 and 6.0, assessed using an extended kaplan–meier method with age as a categorical time‐varying covariate, were significantly longer among patients aged 20 to 35 years compared with patients aged 36 to 50 and 51 to 65 years (p < 0.0001). significant associations were observed between mean expanded disability status scale scores and age at disease onset, current age, and the interaction of age at disease onset and current age (p < 0.001). current age had a greater effect (59% of variability in the model) on disease severity than did age at disease onset. furthermore, a multiplicative effect on expanded disability status scale score was observed for age at disease onset and current age combined, indicating a faster rate of disease progression in older patients. in conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrate the impact of age on rate of disability progression in multiple sclerosis and suggest that an age‐adjusted progression index may be a more relevant criterion for defining differences between multiple sclerosis groups.
monitoring response and resistance to the novel arsenical darinaparsin in an aml patient one of the genes associated with both murine and human myeloid leukemia is evi1 (ecotropic viral integration 1 site). evi1 was first identified as a common locus of retroviral integration in myeloid tumors found in akxd mice. the exact mechanism by which evi1 induces leukemogenesis is not clear. studies of the function of evi1 in the bone marrow and in cell lines have shown that the inappropriate expression of evi1 prohibits terminal differentiation of the bone marrow progenitor cells in granulocytes and erythroid cells, but strongly favors hematopoietic differentiation along the megakaryocytic lineage. we summarize recent data showing that evi1 is a complex transcription factor with multiple functions, and this complexity is further demonstrated by the ability of evi1 to interact with coactivators and corepressors and to abrogate cellular response to cytokines.
diffusion mri microstructure models with in vivo human brain connectome data: results from a multi‐group comparison this paper compares a range of compartment models for diffusion mri data on in vivo human acquisitions from a standard 60mt/m system (philips 3t achieva) and a unique 300mt/m system (siemens connectom). the key aim is to determine whether both systems support broadly the same models or whether the connectom higher gradient system supports significantly more complex models. a single volunteer underwent 8h of acquisition on each system to provide uniquely wide and dense sampling of the available space of pulsed-gradient spin-echo (pgse) measurements. we select a set of promising models from the wide set of possible three-compartment models for in vivo white matter (wm) that previous work and preliminary experiments suggest as strong candidates, but extend them to fit for compartmental t2 and diffusivity. we focus on the corpus callosum where the wm fibre architecture is simplest and compare their ability to explain the measured data, using akaike's information criterion (aic), and to predict unseen data, using cross-validation. we also compare the stability of parameter estimates in the presence of i) noise, using bootstrapping, and ii) spatial variation, using visual assessment and comparison with anatomical knowledge. broadly similar models emerge from the aic and cross-validation experiments in both data sets. specifically, a three-compartment model consisting of either a bingham distribution of sticks or a cylinder for the intracellular compartment, an anisotropic diffusion tensor (dt) model for the extracellular compartment, as well as an isotropic csf compartment, performs consistently well. however, various other models also perform well and no single model emerges as clear winner. the wm data (with virtually no csf contamination) do not support compartmental t2 but partially support compartmental diffusivity. evaluation of parameter stability favours simpler models than those identified by aic or cross-validation. they suggest that the level of complexity in models underpinning currently popular microstructure imaging techniques such as noddi, charmed, or activeax, where the number of free parameters is about 4 or 5 rather than 10 or 11, may reflect the level of complexity achievable for a useful technique on current systems, although the 300mt/m data may support more complex models.
calreticulin localizes to plant intra/extracellular peripheries of highly specialized cells involved in pollen-pistil interactions using a polyclonal antibody raised against calreticulin purified and sequenced from maize, we performed an immunocytological study to characterize putative domain-specific subcellular distributions of endoplasmic reticulum (er)-resident calreticulin in meristematic cells of maize root tip. at the light microscopy level, calreticulin was immunolocalized preferentially at cellular peripheries, in addition to nuclear envelopes and cytoplasmic structures. punctate labelling at the longitudinal walls and continuous labelling at the transverse walls was characteristic. immunogold electron microscopy revealed plasmodesmata as the most prominently labelled cell periphery structure. in order to further probe the er-domain-specific distribution of maize calreticulin at plasmodesmata, root apices were exposed to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. plasmolysis was associated with prominent accumulations of calreticulin at callose-enriched plasmodesmata and pit fields while the contracting protoplasts were depleted of calreticulin. in contrast, other er-resident proteins recognized by hdel peptide and bip antibodies localized exclusively to contracted protoplasts. this finding reveals that, in plasmolysed cells, calreticulin enriched er domains at plasmodesmata and pit fields are depleted of other er-resident proteins containing the hdel retention peptide.
swarm algorithms with chaotic jumps applied to noisy optimization problems particle swarm optimization has become a common heuristic technique in the optimization community, with many researchers exploring the concepts, issues, and applications of the algorithm. in spite of this attention, there has as yet been no standard definition representing exactly what is involved in modern implementations of the technique. a standard is defined here which is designed to be a straightforward extension of the original algorithm while taking into account more recent developments that can be expected to improve performance on standard measures. this standard algorithm is intended for use both as a baseline for performance testing of improvements to the technique, as well as to represent pso to the wider optimization community
adaptive clustering for coreference resolution with deterministic rules and web-based language models most coreference resolution models determine if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over a set of constraints or features. this approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. to overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. each tier builds on the previous tier's entity cluster output. further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. this cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. the framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. in spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. this suggests that sieve-based approaches could be applied to other nlp tasks.
crystal structure and dynamics of a lipid-induced potential desensitized-state of a pentameric ligand-gated channel the nicotinic acetylcholine (ach) receptor converts transiently to an open-channel form when activated by ach released into the synaptic cleft. we describe here the conformational change underlying this event, determined by electron microscopy of ach-sprayed and freeze-trapped postsynaptic membranes. ach binding to the α subunits triggers a concerted rearrangement in the ligand-binding domain, involving an ~ 1‐å outward displacement of the extracellular portion of the β subunit where it interacts with the juxtaposed ends of α-helices shaping the narrow membrane-spanning pore. the β-subunit helices tilt outward to accommodate this displacement, destabilising the arrangement of pore-lining helices, which in the closed channel bend inward symmetrically to form a central hydrophobic gate. straightening and tangential motion of the pore-lining helices effect channel opening by widening the pore asymmetrically and increasing its polarity in the region of the gate. the pore-lining helices of the αγ and δ subunits, by flexing between alternative bent and straight conformations, undergo the greatest movements. this coupled allosteric transition shifts the structure from a tense (closed) state toward a more relaxed (open) state.
neuro-inflammatory risk factors for treatment failure in “early second stage” sleeping sickness patients treated with pentamidine the committee of the european concerted action for multiple sclerosis (charcot foundation) organised five workshops to discuss csf analytical standards in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. this consensus report from 12 european countries summarises the results of those workshops. it is hoped that neurologists will confer with their colleagues in clinical chemistry to arrange the best possible local practice. the most sensitive method for the detection of oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands is isoelectric focusing. the same amounts of igg in parallel csf and serum samples are used and oligoclonal bands are revealed with igg specific antibody staining. all laboratories performing isoelectric focusing should check their technique at least annually using “blind” standards for the five different csf and serum patterns. quantitative measurements of igg production in the cns are less sensitive than isoelectric focusing. the preferred method for detection of blood-csf barrier dysfunction is the albumin quotient. the csf albumin or total protein concentrations are less satisfactory. these results must be interpreted with reference to the age of the patient and the local method of determination. cells should be counted. the normal value is no more than 4 cells/microliters. among evolving optional tests, measurement of the combined local synthesis of antibodies against measles, rubella, and/or varicella zoster could represent a significant advance if it offers higher specificity (not sensitivity) for identifying chronic rather than acute inflammation. other tests that may have useful correlations with clinical indices include those for oligoclonal free light chains, igm, iga, or myelin basic protein concentrations.
lack of character displacement in the male recognition molecule, bindin, in altantic sea urchins of the genus echinometra. bindin is a gamete recognition protein known to control species-specific sperm-egg adhesion and membrane fusion in sea urchins. previous analyses have shown that diversifying selection on bindin amino acid sequence is found when gametically incompatible species are compared, but not when species are compatible. the present study analyzes bindin polymorphism and divergence in the three closely related species of echinometra in central america: e. lucunter and e. viridis from the caribbean, and e. vanbrunti from the eastern pacific. the eggs of e. lucunter have evolved a strong block to fertilization by sperm of its neotropical congeners, whereas those of the other two species have not. as in the indo-west pacific (iwp) echinometra, the neotropical species show high intraspecific bindin polymorphism in the same gene regions as in the iwp species. maximum likelihood analysis shows that many of the polymorphic codon sites are under mild positive selection. of the fixed amino acid replacements, most have accumulated along the bindin lineage of e. lucunter. we analyzed the data with maximum likelihood models of variation in positive selection across lineages and codon sites, and with models that consider sites and lineages simultaneously. our results show that positive selection is concentrated along the e. lucunter bindin lineage, and that codon sites with amino acid replacements fixed in this species show by far the highest signal of positive selection. lineage-specific positive selection paralleling egg incompatibility provides support that adaptive evolution of sperm proteins acts to maintain recognition of bindin by changing egg receptors. because both egg incompatibility and bindin divergence are greater between allopatric species than between sympatric species, the hypothesis of selection against hybridization (reinforcement) cannot explain why adaptive evolution has been confined to a single lineage in the american echinometra. instead, processes acting to varying degrees within species (e.g., sperm competition, sexual selection, and sexual conflict) are more promising explanations for lineage-specific positive selection on bindin.
extracellular vesicle-packaged mirna release after short-term exposure to particulate matter is associated with increased coagulation elevated levels of fibrinogen are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, whereas low fibrinogen can lead to a bleeding disorder. we investigated whether micrornas (mirnas), known to act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, regulate fibrinogen production. using transfection of a library of 470 annotated human mirna precursor molecules in huh7 hepatoma cells and quantitative measurements of fibrinogen production, we identified 23 mirnas with down-regulating (up to 64% decrease) and 4 with up-regulating effects (up to 129% increase) on fibrinogen production. among the down-regulating mirnas, we investigated the mechanism of action of 3 hsa-mir-29 family members and hsa-mir-409-3p. overexpression of hsa-mir-29 members led to decreased steady-state levels of all fibrinogen gene (fga, fgb, and fgg) transcripts in huh7 cells. luciferase reporter gene assays demonstrated that this was independent of mirna-fibrinogen 3'-untranslated region interactions. in contrast, overexpression of hsa-mir-409-3p specifically lowered fibrinogen bβ mrna levels, and this effect was dependent on a target site in the fibrinogen bβ mrna 3'-untranslated region. this study adds to the known mechanisms that control fibrinogen production, points toward a potential cause of variable circulating fibrinogen levels, and demonstrates that a screening approach can identify mirnas that regulate clinically important proteins.
synergism between dexketoprofen and meloxicam in an orofacial formalin test was not modified by opioid antagonists. summarydexketoprofen trometamol is a water-soluble salt of the dextrorotatory enantiomer of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) ketoprofen. racemic ketoprofen is used as an analgesic and an anti-inflammatory agent, and is one of the most potent in vitro inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis. this effect is due to the s(+)-enantiomer (dexketoprofen), while the r(−)-enantiomer is devoid of such activity.the pharmacokinetic profile of ketoprofen and its enantiomers was assessed in several animal species and in human volunteers. in humans, the relative bioavailability of oral dexketoprofen trometamol (12.5 and 25mg, respectively) is similar to that of oral racemic ketoprofen (25 and 50mg, respectively), as measured in all cases by the area under the concentration-time curve values for s(+)-ketoprofen. dexketoprofen trometamol, given as a tablet, is rapidly absorbed, with a time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of between 0.25 and 0.75 hours, whereas the tmax for the s-enantiomer after the racemic drug, administered as tablets or capsules prepared with the free acid, is between 0.5 and 3 hours. peak plasma concentrations of 1.4 and 3.1 mg/l are reached after administration of dexketoprofen trometamol 12.5 and 25mg, respectively.from 70 to 80% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine during the first 12 hours, mainly as the acyl-glucuronoconjugated parent drug. no r(−)-ketoprofen is found in the urine after administration of dexketoprofen [s(+)-ketoprofen], confirming the absence of bioinversion of the s(+)-enantiomer in humans.in animal studies, the anti-inflammatory potency of dexketoprofen was always equivalent to that demonstrated by twice the dose of ketoprofen. similarly, animal studies showed a high analgesic potency for dexketoprofen trometamol. the r(−)-enantiomer demonstrated a much lower potency, its analgesic action being apparent only in conditions where the metabolic bioinversion to the s(+)-enantiomer was significant.the gastric ulcerogenic effects of dexketoprofen at various oral doses (1.5 to 6 mg/kg) in the rat do not differ from those of the corresponding double doses (3 to 12 mg/kg) of racemic ketoprofen. repeated (5-day) oral administration of dexketoprofen as the trometamol salt causes less gastric ulceration than was observed after the acid form of both dexketoprofen and the racemate. in addition, single dose dexketoprofen as the free acid at 10 or 20 mg/kg does not show a significant intestinal ulcerogenic effect in rats, while racemic ketoprofen 20 or 40 mg/kg is clearly ulcerogenic to the small intestine.the analgesic efficacy of oral dexketoprofen trometamol 10 and 20mg is superior to that of placebo and similar to that of ibuprofen 400mg in patients with moderate to severe pain after third molar extraction. the time to onset of pain relief appeared to be shorter in patients treated with dexketoprofen trometamol than in those treated with ibuprofen 400mg. dexketoprofen trometamol was well tolerated, with a reported incidence of adverse events similar to that of placebo.
the role of fat emulsion therapy in a rodent model of propranolol toxicity: a preliminary study amphotericin b (amb) remains the gold standard for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. however, the efficacy is limited, with response rates from 10% to 80%. moreover, amb is toxic, especially for the kidneys. new formulations have been developed in an attempt to improve both efficacy and tolerability. in an attempt to reduce toxicity, a number of investigators have reconstituted amb in a lipid emulsion, but few data are available on efficacy in documented infections. an improvement in immediate and renal tolerance was obtained with equivalent daily dose regimens, but the therapeutic index does not appear to be improved. this approach cannot be recommended at present. three lipid formulations have been developed and are now available in most countries: amb colloidal dispersion (abcd), amb lipid complex (ablc), and liposomal amb (ambisome). the efficacy of abcd on various fungal infections has been assessed in open trials, with a response rate of 49% in aspergillosis, 70% in candidiasis, and 67% in mucormycosis. in two randomized trials comparing abcd with amb in invasive aspergillosis and in persistent febrile neutropenia, the response rates were equivalent. abcd was less nephrotoxic. in contrast, immediate reactions to abcd were as frequent and severe as with amb. these immediate effects are more frequent during the first infusions and lessen as treatment continues. the recommended dose is 3–4 mg/kg/day. ablc appeared to be effective as rescue therapy in various types of invasive mycoses, with a response rate of 42% in aspergillosis, 67% in candidiasis, and 82% in fusariosis. efficacy identical to that of amb was demonstrated in a comparative randomized trial involving patients with invasive candidiasis. general and renal tolerability is improved compared with amb. the recommended dose regimen is 5 mg/kg/day. liposomal amb (ambisome) is the only truly liposomal formulation. the response rates in preliminary trials were 66% in aspergillosis and 81% in candidiasis. several comparative studies have confirmed that this formulation has similar or superior efficacy relative to amb in various fungal infections and also in the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. renal and general tolerability is excellent. the optimal dosing remains unclear but is generally between 3 and 5 mg/kg/day. a double‐blind trial comparing the tolerance of liposomal amb and ablc demonstrated that both infusion‐related events and nephrotoxicity were significantly lower for liposomal amb. in sum, the new lipid formulations of amb are effective in various invasive fungal infections. the three formulations exhibit reduced nephrotoxicity compared with conventional amb. large‐scale comparative clinical trials may clarify issues of relative efficacy in various forms of mycotic infections. note
gene regulatory evolution during speciation in a songbird genetic changes affecting gene expression contribute to phenotypic divergence; thus, understanding how regulatory networks controlling gene expression change over time is critical for understanding evolution. prior studies of expression differences within and between species have identified properties of regulatory divergence, but technical and biological differences among these studies make it difficult to assess the generality of these properties or to understand how regulatory changes accumulate with divergence time. here, we address these issues by comparing gene expression among strains and species of drosophila with a range of divergence times and use f1 hybrids to examine inheritance patterns and disentangle cis- and trans-regulatory changes. we find that the fixation of compensatory changes has caused the regulation of gene expression to diverge more rapidly than gene expression itself. specifically, we observed that the proportion of genes with evidence of cis-regulatory divergence has increased more rapidly with divergence time than the proportion of genes with evidence of expression differences. surprisingly, the amount of expression divergence explained by cis-regulatory changes did not increase steadily with divergence time, as was previously proposed. rather, one species (drosophila sechellia) showed an excess of cis-regulatory divergence that we argue most likely resulted from positive selection in this lineage. taken together, this work reveals not only the rate at which gene expression evolves, but also the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for this evolution.
functional analysis of nuclear localization signals in vp1-2 homologues from all herpesvirus subfamilies abstract the herpes simplex virus (hsv) tegument protein vp1-2 is essential for virus entry and assembly. vp1-2 also contains a highly conserved ubiquitin-specific protease (usp) domain within its n-terminal region. despite conservation of the usp and the demonstration that it can act on artificial substrates such as polyubiquitin chains, identification of the relevance of the usp in vivo to levels or function of any substrate remains limited. here we show that hsv vp1-2 usp can act on itself and is important for stability. vp1-2 n-terminal variants encompassing the core usp domain itself were not affected by mutation of the catalytic cysteine residue (c65). however, extending the n-terminal region resulted in protein species requiring usp activity for accumulation. in this context, c65a mutation resulted in a drastic reduction in protein levels which could be stabilized by proteosomal inhibition or by the presence of normal c65. the functional usp domain could increase abundance of unstable variants, indicating action at least in part, in trans. interestingly, full-length variants containing the inactive usp, although unstable when expressed in isolation, were stabilized by virus infection. the catalytically inactive vp1-2 retained complementation activity of a vp1-2-negative virus. furthermore, a recombinant virus expressing a c65a mutant vp1-2 exhibited little difference in single-step growth curves and the kinetics and abundance of vp1-2 or a number of test proteins. despite the absence of a phenotype for these replication parameters, the usp activity of vp1-2 may be required for function, including its own stability, under certain circumstances.
production and function of il-12 in islets and beta cells to analyze the function of the th1-promoting cytokine il-12 in vivo, we generated transgenic (tg) mice (rip-il12 mice) whose pancreatic beta cells constitutively express bioactive il-12 or one of its components, p35 or p40. in contrast to non-tg littermates or single-tg rip-p35 and rip-p40 mice, rip-il12 mice developed a marked pancreatic infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages, mainly around islets. expression of bioactive il-12 primarily upregulated transcript levels of ifn-inducible protein-10 (ip-10), rantes, ifn-gamma, and tnf-alpha in the pancreas. despite the substantial recruitment of mononuclear cells, no biochemical or clinical disease was evident in the exocrine or endocrine pancreas. coexpression of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (lcmv) proteins with il-12 in the beta cells failed to spontaneously activate or expand antigen-specific anti-self/viral t cells in uninfected tg animals. however, when rip-il12 x rip-lcmv tg mice were infected with lcmv, antigen-specific anti-self/viral t cells were induced, which led to an acceleration in the kinetics and severity of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm). thus, the ectopic expression of il-12 does not spontaneously break tolerance and activate antigen-specific t cells in the periphery, but it does worsen ongoing autoimmune disease.
a sodium channel gene scn9a polymorphism that increases nociceptor excitability inherited erythromelalgia/erythermalgia (iem) is a neuropathy characterized by pain and redness of the extremities that is triggered by warmth. iem has been associated with missense mutations of the voltage-gated sodium channel nav1.7, which is preferentially expressed in most nociceptive dorsal root ganglia (drgs) and sympathetic ganglion neurons. several mutations occur in cytoplasmic linkers of nav1.7, with only two mutations in segment 4 (s4) and s6 of domain i. we report here a simplex case with an alanine 863 substitution by proline (a863p) in s5 of domain ii of nav1.7. the functional effect of a863p was investigated by voltage-clamp analysis in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and by current-clamp analysis to determine the effects of a863p on firing properties of small drg neurons. activation of mutant channels was shifted by −8 mv, whereas steady-state fast inactivation was shifted by +10 mv, compared with wild-type (wt) channels. there was a marked decrease in the rate of deactivation of mutant channels, and currents elicited by slow ramp depolarizations were 12 times larger than for wt. these results suggested that a863p could render drg neurons hyperexcitable. we tested this hypothesis by studying properties of rat drg neurons transfected with either a863p or wt channels. a863p depolarized resting potential of drg neurons by +6 mv compared with wt channels, reduced the threshold for triggering single action potentials to 63% of that for wt channels, and increased firing frequency of neurons when stimulated with suprathreshold stimuli. thus, a863p mutant channels produce hyperexcitability in drg neurons, which contributes to the pathophysiology of iem.
the effect of non-enzymatic glycation of extracellular matrix proteins on axonal regeneration in vitro abstract the pattern of collagenisation in peripheral nerve in diabetic polyneuropathy was examined in nerve biopsy specimens from patients with diabetic polyneuropathy in comparison with organ donor control nerves and disease controls (other neuropathies). there was increased endoneurial collagenisation both in the diabetic polyneuropathy cases and the disease controls, this predominantly involving types i and iii. type ii collagen was not detected in organ donor control nerves or in the diabetic and the disease control nerves. there was a relative increase in type vi collagen in the endoneurium in the diabetic nerves immediately surrounding groups of schwann cells. this was not a feature in the other neuropathies. the quantity of types iv, v and vi collagen was increased around the endoneurial microvessels in the diabetic patients and, to a lesser extent, in those with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (hmsn). increased deposition of types iv and v collagen was observed in the perineurium in the diabetic nerves, the latter being most evident in the innermost lamellae where the amount of laminin was possibly also increased. the diameter of the general endoneurial collagen fibrils was greater in the diabetic nerves, although this was not more than in a disease control (hmsn). the collagen fibrils that were present within the basal laminal tubes that had surrounded degenerated myelinated fibres in the diabetic nerves, and those within the onion bulbs of the hmsn cases, were of the normal endoneurial calibre. the expression of laminin by büngner bands in diabetic neuropathy did not differ from that in disease control nerves, nor were any differences detected for fibronectin. whether the changes observed are important for the impaired regenerative capacity in diabetic neuropathy requires further investigation.
mammalian frataxin: an essential function for cellular viability through an interaction with a preformed iscu/nfs1/isd11 iron-sulfur assembly complex frataxin is an essential mitochondrial protein whose reduced expression causes friedreich's ataxia (frda), a lethal neurodegenerative disease. it is believed that frataxin is an iron chaperone that participates in iron metabolism. we have tested this hypothesis using the bacterial frataxin ortholog, cyay, and different biochemical and biophysical techniques. we observe that cyay participates in iron-sulfur (fe-s) cluster assembly as an iron-dependent inhibitor of cluster formation, through binding to the desulfurase iscs. the interaction with iscs involves the iron binding surface of cyay, which is conserved throughout the frataxin family. we propose that frataxins are iron sensors that act as regulators of fe-s cluster formation to fine-tune the quantity of fe-s cluster formed to the concentration of the available acceptors. our observations provide new perspectives for understanding frda and a mechanistic model that rationalizes the available knowledge on frataxin.
visual approaches and photography for the study of immediate information space as an ethnographic research method, observation has a long history. the value of observation is that it permits researchers to study people in their native environment in order to understand "things" from their perspective. observation requires the researcher to spend considerable time in the field with the possibility of adopting various roles in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the people being studied. a variety of techniques are used to collect data. gaining access to the group and leaving the field are two important factors that need consideration. other areas of concern involve ethical problems, as well as validity and reliability issues. until recently, few library and information science (lis) studies have included this method; however, observation is gaining favor as lis researchers seek to understand better the role of information in people's everyday lives.
effect of probiotic feed additives on broiler chickens health and performance. 1. the effects of a mixture of 12 lactobacillus strains (lc) on the growth performance, abdominal fat deposition, serum lipids and weight of organs of broiler chickens were studied from 1 to 42 d of age. 2. one hundred and thirty-six 1-d-old male broiler chicks were assigned at random to two dietary treatments: a basal diet (control), and a basal diet with 0·1% lc. 3. the supplementation of lc in broiler diets improved the body weight gain and feed conversion rate from 1 to 42 d of age and was effective in reducing abdominal fat deposition but only after 28 d of age. 4. the lc diets reduced serum total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol and triglycerides in broilers from 21 to 42 d of age. however, there was no significant difference in serum high density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol between control and lc-fed broilers. there was also no significant difference in the weights of organs of control and lc-fed broilers. 5. the results indicated that the mixture of 12 lactobacillus strains have a hypolipidaemic effect on broilers.
roles of the traf6 and pellino e3 ligases in myd88 and rankl signaling tumor necrosis factor (tnf) receptor–associated factor (traf)-6 mediates lys63-linked polyubiquitination for nf-κb activation via its n-terminal ring and zinc finger domains. here we report the crystal structures of traf6 and its complex with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e2) ubc13. the ring and zinc fingers of traf6 assume a rigid, elongated structure. interaction of traf6 with ubc13 involves direct contacts of the ring and the preceding residues, and the first zinc finger has a structural role. unexpectedly, this region of traf6 is dimeric both in the crystal and in solution, different from the trimeric c-terminal traf domain. structure-based mutagenesis reveals that traf6 dimerization is crucial for polyubiquitin synthesis and autoubiquitination. fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis shows that traf6 dimerization induces higher-order oligomerization of full-length traf6. the mismatch of dimeric and trimeric symmetry may provide a mode of infinite oligomerization that facilitates ligand-dependent signal transduction of many immune receptors.
identification of evolutionarily conserved, functional noncoding elements in the promoter region of the sodium channel gene scn8a to identify the transcriptional start sites of the neuronal channel scn8a, we carried out 5'-race (rapid amplification of cdna ends) with rna from human and mouse brain. we recovered four mutually exclusive 5'-untranslated exons (exon 1a to exon 1d) that map to a 1.8-kb region of genomic dna located approximately 70 kb upstream of the first coding exon. the same 5'-untranslated exons are expressed in central, peripheral and sympathetic nervous system and in embryonic and adult brain. a 4.8-kb genomic fragment containing these 5' exons demonstrated promoter activity in transfected mn-1 cells. in transgenic mice, transcription of the 4.8-kb promoter was restricted to brain and spinal cord. the 4.8-kb promoter contains eight consensus sp1-binding sites and two inr sites. a potential nrse/re-1 site is located nearby. two active polyadenylation sites identified by 3'-race are conserved in human, mouse, and chicken scn8a. sequence comparison of human and mouse scn8a identified 12 conserved noncoding elements whose effect on transcription was tested in transfected cells.
effects of acute blood pressure elevation on biochemical-metabolic parameters in individuals with hypertensive crisis background the available studies have not fully analyzed the several factors involved in the genesis of hypertension (ht), especially the association among blood pressure, urinary sodium excretion and renal dysfunction.   objective to assess the ht prevalence and risk factors in different age groups in a representative sample of an urban brazilian population.   methods the studied population (1717 adult individuals) was evaluated by age groups: 18 to 39 years; 40 to 49; 50 to 59; 60 to 69 and > 70 years. quantitative variable means and categorical variables of the hypertensive and normotensive groups were compared.   results the adjusted overall prevalence of ht was 25.23%. the prevalence increased with age and was higher in individuals with low educational level. increased body mass index and abdominal waist were positively related to a higher prevalence of ht. there was a significant positive association between ht and urinary sodium excretion. hypertensive individuals presented higher frequency of renal dysfunction, defined as measured creatinine clearance <60 ml/min/m(2). the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 5.6% in the overall population and 14.5% in hypertensive individuals. hypertension was a known condition to 74.4% of the hypertensive individuals. among treated hypertensive individuals, 52.4% achieved controlled blood pressure and only 34.3% of the overall hypertensive patients (treated or not) had blood pressure controlled.   conclusion this population-based is unique by gathering different demographic, epidemiologic and risk factors involved in the genesis of hypertension in a single sample assessment with a population calculation, which might be extrapolated to other hypertensive populations.
a prospective, population-based study of androstenedione, estrogens, and prostatic cancer. plasma testosterone, androstenedione, oestradiol-17beta, follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) and luteinizing hormone (lh) were not significantly different in patients with prostatic cancer, with benign prostatic hyperplasia or in patients without prostatic disease. plasma prolactin concentrations were significantly lower in the patients with benign disease than those with prostatic carcinoma. endocrine therapy in the form of stilboestrol administration significantly decreased plasma levels of testosterone, oestradiol-17beta, fsh and lh within 7 days of the treatment. after 7 days therapy prolactin levels increased significantly in all patients studied. changes in growth hormone concentrations were more varied in response to stilboestrol, being elevated in several patients and remaining unchanged in others. treatment of a few prostatic carcinoma patients who were receiving stilboestrol therapy with cb154, an inhibitor of prolactin secretion, brought an immediate decrease in prolactin levels which was was sustained. plasma testosterone, androstenedione and growth hormone were unchanged in these patients but a significant decrease in plasma oestradiol-17beta was noted in two patients during cb154 administration.
interaction between science and technology in the field of fuel cells based on patent paper analysis we examine the influence of faculty patenting activity on the rate, quality, and content of public research outputs in a panel dataset spanning the careers of 3,862 academic life scientists. using inverse probability of treatment weights (iptw) to account for the dynamics of self-selection into patenting, we find that patenting has a positive effect on the rate of publication of journal articles, but no effect on the quality of these publications. using several measures of the "patentability" of the content of research papers, we also find that patenters may be shifting their research focus to questions of commercial interest. we conclude that the often-voiced concern that patenting in academe has a nefarious effect on public research output is, at least in its simplest form, misplaced.
control of prepotent responses by the superior medial frontal cortex intelligent behavior depends on the ability to suppress inappropriate actions and resolve interference between competing responses. recent clinical and neuroimaging evidence has demonstrated the involvement of prefrontal, parietal, and premotor areas during behaviors that emphasize conflict and inhibition. it remains unclear, however, whether discrete subregions within this network are crucial for overseeing more specific inhibitory demands. here we probed the functional specialization of human prefrontal cortex by combining repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) with integrated behavioral measures of response inhibition (stop-signal task) and response competition (flanker task). participants undertook a combined stop-signal/flanker task after rtms of the inferior frontal gyrus (ifg) or dorsal premotor cortex (dpm) in each hemisphere. stimulation of the right ifg impaired stop-signal inhibition under conditions of heightened response competition but did not influence the ability to suppress a competing response. in contrast, stimulation of the right dpm facilitated execution but had no effect on inhibition. neither of these results was observed during rtms of corresponding left-hemisphere regions. overall, our findings are consistent with existing evidence that the right ifg is crucial for inhibitory control. the observed double dissociation of neurodisruptive effects between the right ifg and right dpm further implies that response inhibition and execution rely on distinct neural processes despite activating a common cortical network.
mortality outcomes of low-dose computed tomography screening for lung cancer in urban china: a decision analysis and implications for practice background the aggressive and heterogeneous nature of lung cancer has thwarted efforts to reduce mortality from this cancer through the use of screening. the advent of low-dose helical computed tomography (ct) altered the landscape of lung-cancer screening, with studies indicating that low-dose ct detects many tumors at early stages. the national lung screening trial (nlst) was conducted to determine whether screening with low-dose ct could reduce mortality from lung cancer.   methods from august 2002 through april 2004, we enrolled 53,454 persons at high risk for lung cancer at 33 u.s. medical centers. participants were randomly assigned to undergo three annual screenings with either low-dose ct (26,722 participants) or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography (26,732). data were collected on cases of lung cancer and deaths from lung cancer that occurred through december 31, 2009.   results the rate of adherence to screening was more than 90%. the rate of positive screening tests was 24.2% with low-dose ct and 6.9% with radiography over all three rounds. a total of 96.4% of the positive screening results in the low-dose ct group and 94.5% in the radiography group were false positive results. the incidence of lung cancer was 645 cases per 100,000 person-years (1060 cancers) in the low-dose ct group, as compared with 572 cases per 100,000 person-years (941 cancers) in the radiography group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.03 to 1.23). there were 247 deaths from lung cancer per 100,000 person-years in the low-dose ct group and 309 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the radiography group, representing a relative reduction in mortality from lung cancer with low-dose ct screening of 20.0% (95% ci, 6.8 to 26.7; p=0.004). the rate of death from any cause was reduced in the low-dose ct group, as compared with the radiography group, by 6.7% (95% ci, 1.2 to 13.6; p=0.02).   conclusions screening with the use of low-dose ct reduces mortality from lung cancer.

exploratory survey of patients’ needs and perceptions of psychosocial oncology today only half of those diagnosed with cancer will die of the disease, leaving enormous room for psychosocial interventions to improve the psychological or functional status of those coping with the disease. therefore, social workers in oncology must be current with empirical research. in an effort to integrate current research into social work practice, we reviewed empirical studies with sound research designs to answer the following questions: (1) what portion of cancer patients are likely to need social work services? (2) what types of services do social workers provide to meet these needs? and (3) who is likely to be (or not to be) the recipient of these services. does intervention research include diverse (non-traditional, non-white and non-middle class) clients? the results show about one third of patients will be judged at high-risk for psychosocial problems but that only 15-25% of those who are diagnosed with cancer will eventually use psychosocial oncology services. some have mainly instrumental, concrete needs, and others will use psychosocial counseling. a review of the inclusion of minorities and non-traditional, non-middle-class groups, shows that they are not adequately represented in current intervention research in psychosocial oncology. methods for enlarging their access and participation are suggested.
phylogenetic and syntenic data support a single horizontal transference to a trypanosoma ancestor of a prokaryotic proline racemase implicated in parasite evasion from host defences lymphocyte polyclonal activation is a generalized mechanism of immune evasion among pathogens. in a mouse model of trypanosoma cruzi infection (american trypanosomiasis), reduced levels of polyclonal lymphocyte responses correlate with resistance to infection and cardiopathy. we report here the characterization of a parasite protein with b-cell mitogenic properties in culture supernatants of infective forms, the cloning of the corresponding gene and the analysis of the biological properties of its product. we characterized the protein as a co-factor-independent proline racemase, and show that its expression as a cytoplasmic and/or membrane-associated protein is life-stage specific. inhibition studies indicate that availability of the racemase active site is necessary for mitogenic activity. this is the first report to our knowledge of a eukaryotic amino acid racemase gene. our findings have potential consequences for the development of new immune therapies and drug design against pathogens.
adaptive clustering for coreference resolution with deterministic rules and web-based language models most coreference resolution models determine if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over a set of constraints or features. this approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. to overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. each tier builds on the previous tier's entity cluster output. further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. this cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. the framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. in spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. this suggests that sieve-based approaches could be applied to other nlp tasks.
investigation of metabolites accumulation in medical plant gentiana rigescens during different growing stage using lc-ms/ms and ft-ir a method based on hplc with diode array detector (dad) and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (esi-ms) was established for the simultaneous determination of 5-hmf and its derivatives, including a new 5-hmf derivative, in rehmanniae radix preparata. validation parameters, such as linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, recovery, accuracy, and precision, were successfully obtained. in addition, the efficiencies of diverse extraction methods were compared for the development of a standard analytical method. the verified method was successfully applied to the quantitative determination of four representative metabolites in eighteen r. radix preparata samples from korea and china. additionally, the increase in the amount of 5-hmf derivatives was monitored during the processing of three dried r. radix samples. the results showed that a newly isolated diglycosylated 5-hmf derivative, 5-(α-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→6)-α-d-galactopyranosyloxymethyl)-2-furancarboxaldehyde, appeared in concentrations comparable to that of 5-hmf, suggesting its potential to serve as a marker compound in r. radix preparata.
late neoproterozoic dokhan volcanics, north eastern desert, egypt: geochemistry and petrogenesis willis, k.m., stern, r.j. and clauer, n., 1988. age and geochemistry of late precambrian sediments of the hammamat series from the northeastern desert of egypt. precambrian res., 42: 173-187. late precambrian crustal evolution in the northeastern desert of egypt culminated in a major episode of strong extension, accompanied by bimodal igneous activity and deposition of clastic sediments in restricted terrigenous basins. these sediments, known as the hammamat series, record the uncovering of the evolving crust of the region. we have undertaken petrographic, geochemical, and rb-sr and k-ar geochronologic studies of hammamat samples collected along a single traverse. the lower half of a 400 m thick section consists of coarse detritus shed from nearby ensimatic terranes, while the upper half was derived from rapid reworking of bimodal igneous rocks similar to those of the dokhan volcanics and pink granites, units that are preserved within the region. rb-sr whole-rock analyses give an 8-point isochron age of 585 +_ 15 ma with an initial stsr/~sr of 0.70323 ± 0.00013, interpreted to approximate closely the time of sedimentation. this is very similar to the k-ar ages of the coarser clay fractions (2-0.5 #m) (588-567 ma). this result is consistent with stratigraphic considerations and other geochronological studies indicating that hammamat deposition occurred at ~ 590 ma. rb-sr analyses of leached and unleached size fractions indicate thermal resetting at 524 +_ 17 ma accompanied or followed by fluxing of a radiogenic sr-rich pore fluid (stsr/s~sr =0.7124). this is further indicated by k-ar ages of the 0.2-0.5 ttm size fraction of 542-532 ma.
imaging modalities in the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy. abstract objective. to evaluate contrast-enhanced ultrasound (ceus) and compare it to ultrasound (us) and 64-slice-ct (64-ct) for diagnosing, staging and evaluation of resectability of pancreatic cancer. material and methods. us, ceus and 64-ct were performed in 49 consecutive patients with pancreatic head tumors and with suspected cancer. after evaluation 44 patients had pancreatic head adenocarcinoma and 5 had chronic pancreatitis, all confirmed by histology. results. the sensitivity of us, ceus and 64-ct for diagnosing malignant pancreatic head tumors was 89%, 86% and 93%, respectively, and the overall accuracy was 82%, 86% and 88% respectively. there was no significant difference in the malignant tumor size measurement between us and ceus (p = 0.3619) or between us and 64-ct (p = 0.2129), but a significant difference was seen in the size measured by ceus and 64-ct (p = 0.0197). the ceus measurements on the tumor size were smaller. the overall accuracy for m staging of the patients who had surgery for adenocarcinoma was 86% and 90% for us + ceus and 64-ct, respectively. by performing the ceus and 64-ct we additionally found, respectively, 35% and 45% non-resectable patients of a group of patients, who were considered resectable on the primary radiological image material. conclusions. ceus may be a useful diagnostic tool in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic head tumors. for the assessment of resectability ceus did not prove useful. however, ceus seemed very useful as an additional instrument in the detection of non-resectable patients already considered resectable on primary radiological image material.
interferons accelerate decay of replication-competent nucleocapsids of hepatitis b virus hepatocytes are extensively used in studies of gene regulation but cannot be maintained in long-term culture as replicating, differentiated cells while remaining nontumorigenic. we have derived two hepatocyte lines from livers of transgenic mice overexpressing transforming growth factor alpha, a potent hepatocyte mitogen, which overcome these limitations. the transgenic hepatocytes were maintained for > or = 2 months in serum-supplemented primary culture and gave rise to cell lines, of which two (aml12 and aml14) have been cultured for > 1.5 years (> 80 passages). both lines have typical hepatocyte features such as peroxisomes and bile canalicular-like structures, do not grow in soft agar, and are nontumorigenic in nude mice. like normal hepatocytes, aml cells express high levels of mrna for serum (albumin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and transferrin) and gap junction (connexins 26 and 32) proteins, secrete albumin, and contain solely isozyme 5 of lactate dehydrogenase. after extensive passaging, aml12 cells continue to strongly coexpress hepatocyte connexin mrnas but do not display nonparenchymal cell markers. although mrna levels for some serum proteins progressively fall, high expression in late aml12 cultures may be regained by passage in serum-free medium. the aml14 line loses expression of both differentiated markers and transgene mrna with extended passaging, and hepatocytic traits are only partially restored by passage in serum-free medium. these differentiated, nontumorigenic cell lines should serve as models in which to study hepatocyte growth and differentiation.
socs36e limits stat signaling via cullin2 and a socs-box independent mechanism in the drosophila egg chamber patterns of cell fates generated by morphogens are critically important for normal development; however, the mechanisms by which graded morphogen signals are converted into all-or-none cell fate responses are incompletely understood. in the drosophila ovary, high and sustained levels of the secreted morphogen unpaired (upd) specify the migratory border-cell population by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat). a lower or transient level of stat activity specifies a non-migratory population of follicle cells. here we identify mir-279 as a component of a feedback pathway that further dampens the response in cells with low levels of jak/stat activity. mir-279 directly repressed stat, and loss of mir-279 mimicked stat gain-of-function or loss of apontic (apt), a known feedback inhibitor of stat. apt was essential for mir-279 expression in non-migratory follicle cells, whereas another stat target, ken and barbie (ken), downregulated mir-279 in border cells. mathematical modelling and simulations of this regulatory circuit including mir-279, apt and ken supported key roles for mir-279 and apt in generating threshold responses to the upd gradient.
perioperative complications after surgical treatment in degenerative adult de novo scoliosis the purpose of this study was to document the diagnostic findings in a group of adult patients presenting with both scoliosis and pain. fifty-five adults were evaluated by medical history, physical examination, radiography, myelography followed by computed tomography, discography followed by computed tomography, and single- and dual-photon densitometry. curves were 49% adult degenerative onset, 44% idiopathic. the older degenerative patients had myelographic defects most commonly within the primary curve and multiple abnormal, not necessarily painful, discs throughout the lumbar spine on discography. the idiopathic group had myelographic defects most commonly in a compensatory lumbar or lumbosacral curve. on discography, all idiopathic patients had at least one abnormal, painful disc, and 88% had their pain reproduced. pain-producing pathology was frequently identified in areas that would not have been included in the fusion area according to accepted rules for treatment of idiopathic scoliosis.
adolescents, adults and rewards: comparing motivational neurocircuitry recruitment using fmri adolescence is a developmental period that entails substantial changes in affective and incentive-seeking behavior relative to both childhood and adulthood, including a heightened propensity to engage in risky behaviors and experience persistent negative and labile mood states. this review discusses the emotional and incentive-driven behavioral changes in adolescents and their associated neural mechanisms, focusing on the dynamic interactions between the amygdala, ventral striatum, and prefrontal cortex. common behavioral changes during adolescence may be associated with a heightened responsiveness to incentives and emotional cues while the capacity to effectively engage in cognitive and emotion regulation is still relatively immature. we highlight empirical work in humans and animals that addresses the interactions between these neural systems in adolescents relative to children and adults, and propose a neurobiological model that may account for the nonlinear changes in adolescent behavior. finally, we discuss other influences that may contribute to exaggerated reward and emotion processing associated with adolescence, including hormonal fluctuations and the role of the social environment.
straight sinus thrombosis during neurosurgical operation the basal ganglia and thalamus are paired deep gray matter structures that may be involved by a wide variety of disease entities. the basal ganglia are highly metabolically active and are symmetrically affected in toxic poisoning, metabolic abnormalities, and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. both the basal ganglia and thalamus may be affected by other systemic or metabolic disease, degenerative disease, and vascular conditions. focal flavivirus infections, toxoplasmosis, and primary central nervous system lymphoma may also involve both deep gray matter structures. the thalamus is more typically affected alone by focal conditions than by systemic disease. radiologists may detect bilateral abnormalities of the basal ganglia and thalamus in different acute and chronic clinical situations, and although magnetic resonance (mr) imaging is the modality of choice for evaluation, the correct diagnosis can be made only by taking all relevant clinical and laboratory information into account. the neuroimaging diagnosis is influenced not only by detection of specific mr imaging features such as restricted diffusion and the presence of hemorrhage, but also by detection of abnormalities involving other parts of the brain, especially the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and white matter. judicious use of confirmatory neuroimaging investigations, especially diffusion-weighted imaging, mr angiography, mr venography, and mr spectroscopy during the same examination, may help improve characterization of these abnormalities and help narrow the differential diagnosis.
rate of thyroglossal duct remnant visualization after total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma and its impact on clinical outcome of radioactive iodine (i-131) ablation objective the purpose of this study was to determine the incremental value of (131)i spect/ct over traditional planar imaging of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma.   materials and methods fifty-six planar and spect/ct scans were obtained for 53 patients. forty-eight scans were diagnostic (131)i studies before first radioiodine therapy, four were diagnostic (131)i studies with recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone stimulation, and four scans were posttherapy (131)i studies. two nuclear physicians interpreted central neck and distant activity on planar scans and reviewed spect/ct images to assess the incremental diagnostic value with respect to localization and characterization of focal activity and to evaluate reader confidence. one of the readers was unblinded and had access to clinical, imaging, histologic, and biochemical information.   results planar scans depicted 130 neck foci and 17 distant foci. at spect/ct these foci were further characterized as thyroglossal duct and thyroid bed remnant (n = 98), cervical nodal metastasis or local residual disease (n = 26), physiologic activity (n = 11), and distant metastasis (n = 12). interobserver disagreement occurred on eight of 147 foci (5%). because of superior lesion localization and additional anatomic information derived from the low-dose ct component, incremental diagnostic value with spect/ct over planar imaging was found for 70 of 147 foci (47.6%), including 53 of 130 neck foci (40.8%) and all 17 (100%) distant foci. reader confidence increased regarding 104 of 147 foci (70.7%).   conclusion iodine-131 spect/ct is useful for accurate evaluation of regional and distant activity in characterization of foci as residual thyroid tissue or nodal, pulmonary, or osseous metastasis. suspected physiologic mimics of disease can be confirmed with increased reader confidence.
physical exposure of sign language interpreters: baseline measures and reliability analysis the objectives of this study were (a) to determine errors in wrist angle measurements from a commercially available biaxial electrogoniometer and (b) to develop a calibration routine in order to correct for these errors. goniometric measurements were collected simultaneously with true angular data using a fixture that allowed wrist movement in one plane while restricting motion in the orthogonal plane. these data were collected in two sets of trials: flexion/extension with radial/ulnar deviation restricted, and radial/ulnar deviation with flexion/extension restricted. during these trials, we studied discrete 30° increments of forearm rotation. the results showed the expected cross talk and zero drift errors during forearm rotation. the application of mathematical equations that describe the effect of goniometer twist resulted in significant error reduction for most forearm rotations. the calibration technique employs both a slope and a displacement transformation to improve the accuracy of angular data. the calibration technique may be used on data collected in the field if forearm rotation is measured simultaneously with the goniometer data.
improving named entity recognition for morphologically rich languages using word embeddings in this paper, we present our effort to consolidate and push further the named entity recognition (ner) research for the czech language. the research in czech is based upon a non-standard basis. some systems are constructed to provide hierarchical outputs whereas the rests give flat entities. direct comparison among these system is therefore impossible. our first goal is to tackle this issue. we build our own ner system based upon conditional random fields (crf) model. it is constructed to output either flat or hierarchical named entities thus enabling an evaluation with all the known systems for czech language. we show a 3.5 – 11% absolute performance increase when compared to previously published results. as a last step we put our system in the context of the research for other languages. we show results for english, spanish and dutch corpora. we can conclude that our system provides solid results when compared to the foreign state of the art.
extrapair paternity rates vary with latitude and elevation in emberizid sparrows comprehensive, accurate paternity assignment is critical to answering numerous questions in evolutionary ecology. yet, most studies of species with extra‐pair paternity (epp) fail to assign sires to all offspring. common limitations include incomplete and biased sampling of offspring and males, particularly with respect to male location and social status, potentially biasing estimated patterns of paternity. studies that achieve comprehensive sampling and paternity assignment are therefore required. accordingly, we genotyped virtually all males and >99% of 6‐day‐old offspring over 16 years in a song sparrow (melospiza melodia) population and used three complementary statistical methodologies to attempt complete paternity assignment for all 2207 offspring. assignments were highly consistent across maximum likelihood methods that used solely genotype data, and heuristic and integrated bayesian analyses that included data describing individual locations. sires were assigned to >99% of all genotyped offspring with ≥95% confidence, revealing an epp rate of c. 28%. extra‐pair sires primarily occupied territories neighbouring their extra‐pair offspring; spatial location was therefore highly informative for paternity assignment. epp was biased towards paired territorial males, although unpaired territorial and floater males sired c. 13% of extra‐pair offspring. failing to sample and include unpaired males as candidate sires would therefore substantially reduce assignment rates. these analyses demonstrate the integration of genetic and ecological information to achieve comprehensive paternity assignment and direct biological insight, illustrate the potential biases that common forms of incomplete sampling could have on estimated patterns of epp, and provide an essential basis for understanding the evolutionary causes and consequences of epp.
expression and function of s100a8/a9 (calprotectin) in human typhoid fever and the murine salmonella model the discovery of toll-like receptors (tlrs) as components that recognize conserved structures in pathogens has greatly advanced understanding of how the body senses pathogen invasion, triggers innate immune responses and primes antigen-specific adaptive immunity. although tlrs are critical for host defense, it has become apparent that loss of negative regulation of tlr signaling, as well as recognition of self molecules by tlrs, are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. furthermore, it is now clear that the interaction between tlrs and recently identified cytosolic innate immune sensors is crucial for mounting effective immune responses. here we describe the recent advances that have been made by research into the role of tlr biology in host defense and disease.
cytoplasmic translocation, aggregation, and cleavage of tdp-43 by enteroviral proteases modulate viral pathogenesis ubiquitin-positive, tau- and α-synuclein–negative inclusions are hallmarks of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. although the identity of the ubiquitinated protein specific to either disorder was unknown, we showed that tdp-43 is the major disease protein in both disorders. pathologic tdp-43 was hyper-phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved to generate c-terminal fragments and was recovered only from affected central nervous system regions, including hippocampus, neocortex, and spinal cord. tdp-43 represents the common pathologic substrate linking these neurodegenerative disorders.
molecular regulation of alternative polyadenylation (apa) within the drosophila nervous system cleavage factor i(m) (cfi(m)) is a highly conserved component of the eukaryotic mrna 3' processing machinery that functions in sequence-specific poly(a) site recognition through the collaboration of a 25 kda subunit containing a nudix domain and a larger subunit of 59, 68, or 72 kda containing an rna recognition motif (rrm). our previous work demonstrated that cfi(m)25 is both necessary and sufficient for sequence-specific binding of the poly(a) site upstream element ugua. here, we report the crystal structure of cfi(m)25 complexed with the rrm domain of cfi(m)68 and rna. the cfi(m)25 dimer is clasped on opposite sides by two cfi(m)68 rrm domains. each cfi(m)25 subunit binds one ugua element specifically. biochemical analysis indicates that the cfi(m)68 rrms serve to enhance rna binding and facilitate rna looping. the intrinsic ability of cfi(m) to direct rna looping may provide a mechanism for its function in the regulation of alternative poly(a) site selection.
evidence for source–sink dynamics in a regional population of arctic ground squirrels (urocitellus parryii plesius) nous avons etudie les sousliks arctiques (urocitellus parryii plesius (osgood, 1900); anterieurement spermophilus parryii plesius osgood, 1900) dans trois types d'habitat distincts (la foret boreale, les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines) dans la region de kluane dans le sud-ouest du territoire du yukon, canada, de 2008 a 2010, afin de determiner si les populations de ces differents habitats presentaient des repartitions et des abondances specifiques aux habitats. on a demontre que leur abondance dans la foret boreale est synchronisee avec le cycle des lievres d'amerique (lepus americanus erxleben, 1777) dans la region a cause de leurs predateurs communs. nous avons predit que les populations dans la foret boreale devraient etre basses a cause du minimum actuel dans le cycle des lievres d'amerique, mais que les sousliks devraient etre relativement abondants dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines. les densites en fin d'ete differaient significativement entre les divers types d'habitats, avec 0,38 ± 0.13 souslik/ha (moyenne ± 1 es) dans l'habitat de foret boreale, 1,25 ± 0,22 souslik/ha dans l'habitat de prairie basse et 5,7 ± 0,22 sousliks/ha dans l'habitat de prairie alpine. en 2009, les populations ont ete extirpees de l'habitat de foret boreale, alors que les densites dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines etaient respectivement de 1,6 ± 0,34 souslik/ha et de 6,1 ± 0,7 sousliks/ha. l'absence actuelle de sousliks dans la foret boreale et la persistance des populations dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines laissent croire a l'existence d'une dynamique de type source-puits entre les types d'habitats de foret boreale et de prairie.
up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor by membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase stimulates human glioma xenograft growth and angiogenesis. angiogenesis is the process in which new vessels emerge from existing endothelial lined vessels. this is distinct from the process of vasculogenesis in that the endothelial cells arise by proliferation from existing vessels rather than differentiating from stem cells. angiogenesis is an invasive process that requires proteolysis of the extracellular matrix and, proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, as well as synthesis of new matrix components. during embryonic development, both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis contribute to formation of the circulatory system. in the adult, with the single exception of the reproductive cycle in women, angiogenesis is initiated only in response to a pathologic condition, such as inflammation or hypoxia. the angiogenic response is critical for progression of wound healing and rheumatoid arthritis. angiogenesis is also a prerequisite for tumor growth and metastasis formation. therefore, understanding the cellular events involved in angiogenesis and the molecular regulation of these events has enormous clinical implications. this understanding is providing novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including cancer.
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in paediatrics: clinical characteristics, therapy and outcomes we report on four children with heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia type ii. in three patients, therapy with unfractionated heparin was associated with development of cardiac thrombi or with thrombosis progression up to the inferior vena cava or with aggravation of peripheral arterial occlusion. in the fourth child, the disease was recognized early on, and no complication occurred. heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia type ii was confirmed by heparin‐induced platelet activation assay and/or heparin/platelet factor 4‐elisa. concomitant elevated antiphospholipid antibodies were seen in all patients. danaparoid sodium applied at a dosage of between 1.2 and 7.1 u/kg/h stopped the disease progression in each patient. three children had a clinical recovery with partial recanalization, but for the child with peripheral arterial occlusion disease, amputation of some of the toes became necessary.
health effects on children’s willingness to compete this paper introduces a three-item "cognitive reflection test" (crt) as a simple measure of one type of cognitive ability—the ability or disposition to reflect on a question and resist reporting the first response that comes to mind. the author will show that crt scores are predictive of the types of choices that feature prominently in tests of decision-making theories, like expected utility theory and prospect theory. indeed, the relation is sometimes so strong that the preferences themselves effectively function as expressions of cognitive ability—an empirical fact begging for a theoretical explanation. the author examines the relation between crt scores and two important decision-making characteristics: time preference and risk preference. the crt scores are then compared with other measures of cognitive ability or cognitive "style." the crt scores exhibit considerable difference between men and women and the article explores how this relates to sex differences in time and risk preferences. the final section addresses the interpretation of correlations between cognitive abilities and decision-making characteristics.
new causally ordered delivery protocol using information of immediate predecessor messages between brokers and subscribers with the sharp increase in heterogeneity and distribution of elements in wide-area networks, more flexible, efficient and autonomous approaches for management and information distribution are needed. this paper proposes a novel approach, based on gossip protocols and firefly synchronisation theory, for the management policy distribution and synchronisation over a number of nodes in an application level active network (alan). the work is presented in the context of the ist project android (active network distributed open infrastructure development), which is developing an autonomous policy-based management system for alan. the preliminary simulation results suggest that with the appropriately optimised parameters, the algorithms developed are scalable, can work effectively in a realistic random network, and allow the policy updates to be distributed efficiently throughout the active network with a lower latency than other similar types of gossip protocols.
what is the value of b-type natriuretic peptide testing for diagnosis, prognosis or monitoring of critically ill adult patients in intensive care? objective:the role of plasma b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp) in critically ill patients with acute pulmonary edema is controversial. we postulated that a low bnp level would exclude cardiac dysfunction as the principal cause of pulmonary edema and therefore help in the diagnosis of acute lung injury. design:a retrospective derivation cohort was followed by a prospective validation cohort of consecutive patients with acute pulmonary edema admitted to three intensive care units. bnp was measured within 24 hrs from onset. critical care experts blinded to bnp results integrated clinical data with the course of disease and response to therapy and served as the reference standard. setting:three intensive care units at the tertiary center. patients:consecutive critically ill patients with acute pulmonary edema. interventions:none. measurements and main results:in a derivation cohort of 84 patients, a bnp threshold of ≤250 pg/ml had a specificity of 87% and sensitivity of 48% for the diagnosis of acute lung injury. high specificity of bnp (90%, likelihood ratio of 3.9) was confirmed in a validation cohort of 120 consecutive patients, 52 (43%) of whom had acute lung injury. notably, 32% of patients with acute lung injury had concomitant cardiac dysfunction. the median time from the onset of pulmonary edema to bnp testing was 3 hrs. the accuracy of bnp (area under receiver operator curve, 0.71) was comparable with pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (area under receiver operator curve, 0.66) and superior to ejection fraction (area under receiver operator curve, 0.60) in subgroups of patients in whom these tests were performed. the accuracy of bnp improved when patients with renal insufficiency were excluded (area under receiver operator curve, 0.82). conclusion:when measured early after the onset of acute pulmonary edema, a bnp level of <250 pg/ml supports the diagnosis of acute lung injury. the high rate of cardiac and renal dysfunction in critically ill patients limits the discriminative role of bnp. no level of bnp could completely exclude cardiac dysfunction.
women’s disempowerment and preference for risky skin whitening products: experimental evidence from india according to the ‘doing well by doing good’ proposition, firms have a corporate social responsibility to achieve some larger social goals, and can do so without a financial sacrifice. this paper empirically tests this proposition by examining in depth the case of ‘fair & lovely,’ a skin whitening cream, marketed by unilever in many countries in asia and africa, and, in particular, india. fair & lovely is indeed doing well; it is a profitable and fast growing brand. it is, however, not doing good, and we demonstrate its negative implications for public welfare. we conclude with thoughts on how to reconcile this divergence between private profits and public welfare.
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor binding: autoradiographic localization in rat brain protein kinase c is a calcium- and phospholipid-stimulated enzyme present in high concentration in the brain. phorbol esters are potent tumor promoters that bind to specific receptors with high affinity. several lines of evidence indicate that the phorbol ester receptor is identical to protein kinase c. to determine the distribution of protein kinase c, we have localized phorbol ester receptors in the rat brain by autoradiography, using [3h]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate ([3h]pdbu) and have performed a variety of lesions to assess the nature of the cellular elements possessing the binding sites. the [3h]pdbu binding sites in the rat brain are discretely localized and primarily associated with neurons. evidence is presented for localization to intrinsic neurons of the cortex and hippocampus, terminals of the striatonigral projection, a projection to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, and to dendrites of purkinje cells.
cascade bioassay evidence for the existence of urothelium-derived inhibitory factor in guinea pig urinary bladder 1 the effect of adenosine 5′‐triphosphate (atp) on the free cytosolic ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]i) as measured with the fluorescent ca2+‐indicator fura‐2, and on force was investigated in the intact smooth muscle strips of the mouse urinary bladder. 2 atp elicited, when exogenously applied, a large increase of [ca2+]i with limited force development resulting in a marked ca2+‐force dissociation. 3 release of endogenous neurotransmitters by transmural electrical stimulation (tes) for 30 s induced a steady increase of [ca2+]i and a peak contraction, followed within 15 s by a relaxation. 4 in carbachol‐prestimulated preparations, atp elicited an initial rise of [ca2+]i followed by a return to the initial precontraction ca2+‐level. force in contrast presented a biphasic pattern, i.e. an initial contraction was followed by a sustained relaxation. 5 in the k+‐depolarized precontracted preparation, atp elicited a slight initial rise of [ca2+]i. the partial relaxation of the force during depolarization was not preceded by a transient contraction. 6 the atp‐induced relaxation of the k+‐prestimulated preparations was not inhibited by 8‐phenyltheophylline, a potent p1‐purinoceptor antagonist. 7 the order of potency for relaxation of the atp analogues was 2‐mesatp>atp>βγme‐atp, which is characteristic for p2y‐purinoceptors. 8 these results indicate that, besides its activating effect, atp also relaxes the mouse urinary bladder. it is suggested that the relaxant effect, mediated through p2y‐purinoceptors, is mainly responsible for the low contractile potency of atp in the bladder.

exploiting the dram microarchitecture to increase memory-level parallelism modern drams have multiple banks to serve multiple memory requests in parallel. however, when two requests go to the same bank, they have to be served serially, exacerbating the high latency of off-chip memory. adding more banks to the system to mitigate this problem incurs high system cost. our goal in this work is to achieve the benefits of increasing the number of banks with a low cost approach. to this end, we propose three new mechanisms that overlap the latencies of different requests that go to the same bank. the key observation exploited by our mechanisms is that a modern dram bank is implemented as a collection of subarrays that operate largely independently while sharing few global peripheral structures. our proposed mechanisms (salp-1, salp-2, and masa) mitigate the negative impact of bank serialization by overlapping different components of the bank access latencies of multiple requests that go to different subarrays within the same bank. salp-1 requires no changes to the existing dram structure and only needs reinterpretation of some dram timing parameters. salp-2 and masa require only modest changes (<;0.15% area overhead) to the dram peripheral structures, which are much less design constrained than the dram core. evaluations show that all our schemes significantly improve performance for both single-core systems and multi-core systems. our schemes also interact positively with application-aware memory request scheduling in multi-core systems.
the tig 1 histone deacetylase complex regulates infectious growth in the rice blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae antifungal defensins, msdef1 and mtdef4, from medicago spp., inhibit the growth of fusarium graminearum, which causes head blight disease in cereals. in order to determine the signalling cascades that are modulated by these defensins, we have isolated several insertional mutants of f. graminearum that exhibit hypersensitivity to msdef1, but not to mtdef4. the molecular characterization of two of these mutants, designated enhanced sensitivity to defensin (esd), has revealed that the mgv1 and gpmk1 map kinase signalling cascades play a major role in regulating sensitivity of f. graminearum to msdef1, but not to mtdef4. the hog1 map kinase signalling cascade, which is responsible for adaptation of this fungus to hyperosmotic stress, does not participate in the fungal response to these defensins. significantly, the esd mutants also exhibit hypersensitivity to other tested defensins and are highly compromised in their pathogenesis on wheat heads and tomato fruits. the studies reported here for the first time implicate two map kinase signalling cascades in a plant defensin‐mediated alteration of fungal growth. based on our findings, we propose that specific map kinase signalling cascades are essential for protection of a fungal pathogen from the antimicrobial proteins of its host plant.
rab8 directs furrow ingression and membrane addition during epithelial formation in drosophila melanogaster cellularization of the drosophila embryo is a specialized form of cytokinesis that results in the formation of a polarized epithelium. the mechanisms of membrane growth during cytokinesis are largely unknown. it is also unclear whether membrane growth and polarization represent distinct processes that occur simultaneously or whether growth of the membrane is involved in the emergence of polarity. using a combination of surface labeling and particles tracking techniques, we monitored the dynamics of marked membrane regions during cellularization. we find that the major source of membrane is intracellular, rather than in the form of a plasma membrane reservoir. depolymerization of microtubules inhibits the export of a newly synthesized transmembrane protein from the golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane and simultaneously blocks membrane growth. membrane insertion occurs in a defined sequence at specific sites, first apical, then apical–lateral. diffusion of the membrane appears insufficient to compete with the massive local insertion of new membrane. we thus identify a tightly regulated scheme of polarized membrane insertion during cellularization. we propose that such a mechanism could participate in the progressive emergence of apical–basal polarity.

evaluating seroprevalence to circumsporozoite protein to estimate exposure to three species of plasmodium in the brazilian amazon the persistence of malarial antibodies was evaluated in subjects living in a rural community (in minas gerais state, brazil) briefly exposed to a plasmodium vivax malaria outbreak outside of the area in which malaria was endemic. transmission was interrupted by treatment of all patients and their relatives and/or neighbors, although the latter had neither symptoms nor blood parasites. antibodies to p. vivax antigens (recombinant proteins from sporozoites [rpvcs] and from blood stages [rpv200]) were measured in parallel by elisa with sera collected at two time points after transmission. anti-rpvcs igg antibodies were positive in approximately 40% and 20% of the subjects 8 months and 7 years after exposure, respectively. anti-rpv200 igg was first detected in 61% of the subjects who had had malarial symptoms and remained positive in 47% after 7 years. among the prophylactically treated group, anti-rpv200 igg was detected in only 28% after 8 months. the levels of both antibodies decreased with time in all positive subjects.
the influence of image resolution on the positron emission tomographic measurement of caudate glucose consumption the aim of this study was to analyze the influence of variations in the size of regions of interest (rois) on values of caudate glucose consumption [regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rcmrglc)] assessed by pet. in addition, we tried to establish the influence of roi size on levels of significance assessing differences in mean caudate glucose consumption between two groups of subjects. for this purpose, rcmrglc was measured using [18f]fluorodeoxyglucose and the pc-4096 pet camera with an in-plane resolution of 7.1 mm in 12 normal subjects and 12 subjects with early huntington disease. caudate rcmrglc was histographically determined using 10 different roi widths ranging from 2 mm, corresponding to the peak value of caudate rcmrglc, to 20 mm. the increase in roi width from 2 to 20 mm led to a significant decrease of caudate rcmrglc by ∼66% in the normal subjects and in the patients. the student t value assessing the differences in mean caudate rcmrglc between the two groups decreased gradually from 5.61 for an roi width of 2 mm to 3.78 for an roi width of 20 mm. this corresponds to a worsening of the level of significance from 10–5 to 10–3, i.e., by a factor of 100. these data show that (given the resolution of presently used pet cameras) the selection of peak values of caudate rcmrglc is the best way to discriminate between groups of subjects supposed to differ with respect to caudate rcmrglc.
ubiquitin-specific protease 5 is required for the efficient repair of dna double-strand breaks mutations in brca1 are associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. brca1 participates in the dna damage response and acts as a ubiquitin ligase. however, its regulation remains poorly understood. here we report that brca1 is modified by small ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo) in response to genotoxic stress, and co-localizes at sites of dna damage with sumo1, sumo2/3 and the sumo-conjugating enzyme ubc9. pias sumo e3 ligases co-localize with and modulate sumo modification of brca1, and are required for brca1 ubiquitin ligase activity in cells. in vitro sumo modification of the brca1/bard1 heterodimer greatly increases its ligase activity, identifying it as a sumo-regulated ubiquitin ligase (srubl). further, pias sumo ligases are required for complete accumulation of double-stranded dna (dsdna) damage-repair proteins subsequent to rnf8 accrual, and for proficient double-strand break repair. these data demonstrate that the sumoylation pathway plays a significant role in mammalian dna damage response.
why noise is useful in functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing? humans and other animals demonstrate the ability to perceive and respond to temporally relevant information with characteristic behavioral properties. for example, the response time distributions in peak-interval timing tasks are well described by gaussian functions, and superimpose when scaled by the criterion duration. this superimposition has been referred to as the scalar property and results from the fact that the standard deviation of a temporal estimate is proportional to the duration being timed. various psychological models have been proposed to account for such responding. these models vary in their success in predicting the temporal control of behavior as well as in the neurobiological feasibility of the mechanisms they postulate. a review of the major interval timing models reveals that no current model is successful on both counts. the neurobiological properties of the basal ganglia, an area known to be necessary for interval timing and motor control, suggests that this set of structures act as a coincidence detector of cortical and thalamic input. the hypothesized functioning of the basal ganglia is similar to the mechanisms proposed in the beat frequency timing model [r.c. miall, neural computation 1 (1989) 359-371], leading to a reevaluation of its capabilities in terms of behavioral prediction. by implementing a probabilistic firing rule, a dynamic response threshold, and adding variance to a number of its components, simulations of the striatal beat frequency model were able to produce output that is functionally equivalent to the expected behavioral response form of peak-interval timing procedures.
relation between clinical depression risk and physical activity and time spent watching television in older women: a 10-year prospective follow-up study. background: a growing body of evidence suggests that physical activity might reduce the risk of depressive symptoms, but there are limited data on black women.purpose: the objective was to evaluate the association between leisure time physical activity and depressive symptoms in u.s. black women.methods: participants included 35,224 women ages 21 to 69 from the blackwomen’s health study, a follow-up study of african american women in which data are collected biennially by mail questionnaire.women answered questions on past and current exercise levels at baseline (1995) and follow-up (1997). the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (ces-d) was used to measure depressive symptoms in 1999. women who reported a diagnosis of depression before 1999 were excluded. we used multivariate logistic regression models to compute odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for physical activity in relation to depressive symptoms (ces-d score <= 16) with control for potential confounders.results: adult vigorous physical activity was inversely associated with depressive symptoms. women who reported vigorous exercise both in high school (<= 5 hr per week) and adulthood (<= 2 hr per week) had the lowest odds of depressive symptoms (or = 0.76, 95% ci = 0.71−0.82) relative to never active women; the or was 0.90 for women who were active in high school but not adulthood (95% ci = 0.85-0.96) and 0.83 for women who were inactive in high school but became active in adulthood (95% ci = 0.77-0.91). although walking for exercise was not associated with risk of depressive symptoms overall, there was evidence of a weak inverse relation among obese women (body mass index <= 30).conclusions: leisure time vigorous physical activity was associated with a reduced odds of depressive symptoms in u.s. black women.
in ̄ uence of age and predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s on prognosis following complete resection for non-small cell lung carcinoma for men participating in the multiple risk factor intervention trial, the authors evaluated the relation between the baseline forced expiratory volume in one second and lung cancer mortality among smokers between the third and tenth years of follow-up (1973-1974 to 1984). this measure of ventilatory function was a powerful predictor of lung cancer deaths, with rates that increased from 3.02 per 1,000 person-years in the lowest quintile of forced expiratory volume to 0.43 in the highest quintile. this relation was not weakened by adjustments for smoking dose, including number of cigarettes smoked per day, tar and nicotine content, duration of smoking, or age at onset of smoking. nor was forced expiratory volume related to time between its determination and lung cancer death. if these observations can be verified in other studies, the forced expiratory volume in one second may identify smokers at very high risk of lung cancer and, hence, in need of more aggressive preventive approaches.
interlimb coordination in patients with parkinson’s disease: motor learning deficits and the importance of augmented information feedback normal voluntary movements are considered to be of two kinds, or to involve two components, (i) a ballistic or "open-loop" type, which are preprogrammed and executed without reference to current sensory information and (ii) a corrective or "closed-loop" type, whose course or termination are regulated by such information. in a previous paper it was suggested that parkinsonism disrupted the first kind of movement, but intention tremor did not. in the present paper three experiments designed to test this hypothesis are described. subjects were tested on an acquisition-tracking task using an oscilloscope display and joystick control, and measurements were made of the duration, velocity and error of their initial movements to acquire the target. parkinsonian movements were found to be considerably different from normal in that (a) most movements by this group lasted longer than the reaction time for their initiation, as if including some secondary correction in their execution, (b) the rate of movement was not varied for different amplitudes (so keeping the duration fairly constant) as in normal subjects, but rather movements of all amplitudes were made at a constant slow rate, so that duration increased markedly with the larger steps, (c) error increased disproportionately as the velocity of movement increased; in particular any movements completed in one reaction time or less tended to be wildly inaccurate, (d) removing either the target or the response marker from the screen at the beginning of a movement had a significant effect, making it shorter in duration and smaller in amplitude than those usually produced with both markers visible all the time. parkinsonian subjects showed no improvement in performance with repeated attempts at one movement over a whole sequence, so their deficit appears to be stable even after practice on a known fixed task. these results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that parkinsonism interferes with the generation of accurate ballistic action which are characteristic of normal skilled movement. tremor subjects in general resembled normal control subjects in their initial acquistion movements, but their accuracy was less with the larger steps.
ccl18 as an independent favorable prognostic biomarker in patients with colorectal cancer. cell-mediated immunity plays a crucial role in the control of many infectious diseases, necessitating the need for adjuvants that can augment cellular immune responses elicited by vaccines. it is well established that protection against one such disease, malaria, requires strong cd8+ t cell responses targeted against the liver stages of the causative agent, plasmodium spp. in this report we show that the dendritic cell-specific chemokine, dendritic cell-derived cc chemokine 1 (dc-ck1), which is produced in humans and acts on naive lymphocytes, can enhance ag-specific cd8+ t cell responses when coadministered with either irradiated plasmodium yoelii sporozoites or a recombinant adenovirus expressing the p. yoelii circumsporozoite protein in mice. we further show that these enhanced t cell responses result in increased protection to malaria in immunized mice challenged with live p. yoelii sporozoites, revealing an adjuvant activity for dc-ck1. dc-ck1 appears to act preferentially on naive mouse lymphocytes, and its adjuvant effect requires il-12, but not ifn-γ or cd40. overall, our results show for the first time an in vivo role for dc-ck1 in the establishment of primary t cell responses and indicate the potential of this chemokine as an adjuvant for vaccines against malaria as well as other diseases in which cellular immune responses are important.
analysis of epigenetic factors in mouse embryonic neural stem cells exposed to hyperglycemia maternal diabetes causes congenital malformations in various organs including the neural tube in fetuses. in this study, we have analyzed the differential gene expression profiling in the cranial neural tube of embryos from diabetic and control mice by using the oligonucleotide microarray. expression patterns of genes and proteins that are differentially expressed in the cranial neural tube were further examined by the real‐time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. proliferation index and apoptosis were examined by brdu (5‐bromo‐2‐deoxyuridine) labeling and tunel (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick‐end labeling) assay, respectively. embryos (e11.5) of diabetic pregnancies displayed distortion in neuroepithelia of the cranial neural tube. microarray analysis revealed that a total of 390 genes exhibited more than twofold changes in expression level in the cranial neural tube of embryos from diabetic mice. several genes involving apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neurons in the cranial neural tube were differentially expressed in embryos of diabetic pregnancy. in addition, maternal diabetes perturbed the development of choroid plexus and ventricular systems and reduced the production of proteins such as ttr and igf2 in the developing brain, indicating that these changes could impair the survival and proliferation of neuroepithelial cells and neurogenesis in embryos of diabetic mice. it is concluded that altered expression of a variety of genes involved in brain development is associated with cranial neural tube dysmorphogenesis that may subsequently contribute to intellectual impairment of the offspring of a diabetic mother. © 2008 wiley‐liss, inc.
temporal effect of alcohol consumption on reactivity of pial arterioles: role of oxygen radicals. the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of ethanol exposure on responses of cerebral arterioles in vivo. rats were fed liquid diets with or without ethanol for 2-3 mo. using intravital microscopy, we measured diameter of cerebral arterioles in non-ethanol- and ethanol-fed rats in response to acetylcholine, histamine, adp, the thromboxane analogue (u-46619), and nitroglycerin. in non-ethanol-fed rats, acetylcholine, histamine, and adp produced dose-related dilatation of cerebral arterioles. in ethanol-fed rats, however, acetylcholine produced vasoconstriction, and vasodilatation in response to histamine and adp was impaired. dilatation of cerebral arterioles in response to nitroglycerin and vasoconstriction in response to the thromboxane analogue (u-46619) were similar in non-ethanol-fed and ethanol-fed rats. thus these findings suggest that chronic ethanol exposure impairs responses of cerebral arterioles to agonists, which produce dilatation via the release of an endothelium-derived relaxing factor. we speculate that impaired vasodilatation coupled with preservation of vasoconstriction in ethanol-fed rats may have important implications for the pathogenesis of stroke during chronic alcohol ingestion.
peripheral nerve morphogenesis induced by scaffold micropatterning. this report describes a new approach for fabricating microchannels within three‐dimensional electrospun constructs. these key features serve to mimic the fascicular architecture and fibrous extracellular matrix found in native nerve. both electrospun fibers and multi‐channeled structure nerve guides have become areas of increasing interest for their beneficial roles in nerve repair. however, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a guide that incorporates both. multiple parallel channels provide a greater number of defined paths and increased surface area compared to cylindrical guides. additionally, the fibrous nature of electrospun fibers permits better mass transport than solid‐walled constructs. the flexible fabrication scheme allows tailoring of nerve guide parameters such as channel diameters ranging from 33 to 176 µm and various wall thicknesses. channel and fiber structures were assessed by optical and electron microscope images. geometric calculations estimated a porosity of over 85% for these guides with 16% or less from the channels. in vitro culture with schwann cells demonstrated cellular infiltration into channels with restricted migration between fibers. finally, cell proliferation and survival throughout the guide indicates that this design warrants future in vivo examination. biotechnol. bioeng. 2012; 109:1571–1582. © 2011 wiley periodicals, inc.
platypus globin genes and flanking loci suggest a new insertional model for beta-globin evolution in birds and mammals we have explored the evolution of the alpha-globin gene family by comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses of mammalian alpha-globin genes. our analyses reveal the existence of a new alpha-globin gene lineage in mammals that is related to the alpha(d)-globin genes of birds, squamates and turtles. the gene is located in the middle of the alpha-globin gene cluster of a marsupial, sminthopsis macroura and of humans. it exists in a wide variety of additional mammals, including pigs, cows, cats, and dogs, but is a pseudogene in american marsupials. evolutionary analyses suggest that the gene has generally evolved under purifying selection, indicative of a functional gene. the presence of mrna products in humans, pigs, and cows also suggest that the gene is expressed and likely to be functional. the analyses support the hypothesis that the alpha(d)-globin gene lineage has an ancient evolutionary origin that predates the divergence of amniotes. the structural similarity of alpha-globin gene clusters of marsupials and humans suggest that an eight gene cluster (5'-zeta2-zeta1-alpha(d)-alpha3-alpha2-alpha1-theta-omega-3'), including seven alpha-like genes and one beta-like globin gene (omega-globin) existed in the common ancestor of all marsupial and eutherian mammals. this basic structure has remained relatively stable in marsupials and in the lineage leading to humans, although omega-globin has been lost from the alpha-globin gene cluster of humans.
regularized lda based on separable scatter matrices for classification of spatio-spectral eeg patterns linear discriminant analysis (lda) is a well-known scheme for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of labeled data in a vector space. lda has been extended to two-dimensional lda (2dlda), which is an iterative algorithm for data in matrix representation. in this paper, we propose non-iterative algorithms for 2dlda. experimental results show that the non-iterative algorithms achieve competitive recognition rates with the iterative 2dlda, while they are computationally more efficient than the iterative 2dlda
intervertebral disc herniation in adolescents. study design. the authors examined a case series of patients under the age of 18 years treated for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. objectives. to evaluate postoperative and long-term results of surgery in patients younger than 18 years. summary of background data. there are only a few series, with controversial results, available on the surgical treatment of disc herniation in growing patients. methods. between 1975 and 1991, a consecutive series of 129 patients 9–18 years of age (average age, 16.2 years) underwent surgery for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. low back pain associated with leg pain was the main clinical symptom in 106 subjects (82%), back pain in 17 (13%), and leg pain in 6 (5%). results. short-term results were excellent or good for 123 cases (95%), with complete pain relief in 97 (75%) and moderate but incomplete relief in 26 (20%). a total of 98 (76%) long-term responses obtained at a mean follow-up of 12.4 years revealed excellent outcomes in 40% of the cases, good in 47%, and poor in 13%. ten patients (10%) underwent reintervention after 9 years on average (2 fusions and 8 re-explorations for herniated disc). conclusions. results have confirmed a tendency for outcomes to deteriorate between the short-term and long-term follow-up in young patients treated by discectomy: this tendency and the rate of reintervention (10%) confirmed the need for long-term follow-up of children and adolescents treated for disc herniation.
elevated plasma adiponectin and decreased plasma homocysteine and asymmetric dimethylarginine in children with type 1 diabetes adiponectin, also referred to as acrp30, adipoq, and gbp28, is a plasma protein exclusively produced by adipose tissue and a possible insulin-sensitizing agent (1–6). serum adiponectin levels are negatively correlated to bmi in healthy individuals and decreased in type 2 diabetic patients (1–6). however, serum adiponectin levels in type 1 diabetes have not been elucidated.  we examined the serum adiponectin concentrations in 46 type 1 diabetic patients (21 males and 25 females) and compared them with those of bmi-matched healthy control subjects (17 males and 19 females). mean age was 33 ± 3 and 33 ± 4 years, bmi was 19.8 ± 0.5 and 19.9 ± 0.6 kg/m2, hba1c level was 9.7± 0.7 and 10.4 ± 0.6%, duration of diabetes was 3.2 ± 0.9 and 3.4 ± 1.3 years, and urinary c-peptide excretion was 18.4 ± 4.3 and 18.0 ± 2.4 μg/day in male and …
signal processing using singular spectrum analysis for nonlinear system identification support vector machines is a powerful methodology for solving problems in nonlinear classification, function estimation and density estimation which has also led recently to many new developments in kernel based learning in general. in these methods one solves convex optimization problems, typically quadratic programs. we focus on least squares support vector machines which are reformulations to standard svms that lead to solving linear kkt systems. least squares support vector machines are closely related to regularization networks and gaussian processes but additionally emphasize and exploit primaldual interpretations from optimization theory. in view of interior point algorithms such ls-svm kkt systems can be considered as a core problem. where needed the obtained solutions can be robustified and/or sparsified. as an alternative to a top-down choice of the cost function, methods from robust statistics are employed in a bottom-up fashion for further improving the estimates. we explain the natural links between ls-svm classifiers and kernel fisher discriminant analysis. the framework is further extended towards unsupervised learning by considering pca analysis and its kernel version as a one-class modelling problem. this leads to new primal-dual support vector machine formulations for kernel pca and kernel canonical correlation analysis. furthermore, ls-svm formulations are mentioned towards recurrent networks and control, thereby extending the methods from static to dynamic problems. in general, support vector machines may pose heavy computational challenges for large data sets. for this purpose, we propose a method of fixed size ls-svm where the estimation is done in the primal space in relation to a nyström sampling with active selection of support vectors and we discuss extensions to committee networks. the methods will be illustrated by several benchmark and real-life applications.
signal and noise in p300 recordings to visual stimuli to examine the topographic relationship of p3(00) between the visual and auditory modalities, especially to examine whether there are any modality-specific hemispheric differences of p3 in normal adults. methods: the p3s were recorded from the same 41 normal right-handed males between the ages of 20 and 33 in both a typical auditory oddball task and a visual oddball paradigm with novel stimuli, with an extensive set of 61 scalp electrodes. in addition to the visual comparison and quantitative assessment of current source density (csd) maps between the two modalities, canonical correlation analyses on the p3 raw amplitudes and examination of interaction effects of modality × location on both raw and normalized p3 data were performed. results: the canonical correlation between modalities was generally high, especially at the left parietal brain region. there were no significant hemispheric effects in anterior brain but significant left-greater- than-right hemispheric effects in posterior brain regions in both modalities; modality-specific hemispheric effect was observed only at the parietal region. strong surface current density activities were observed in the midline parietal-occipital area, and left and right boundary areas of temporal and inferior frontal region. conclusions: the topographic similarities between p3s recorded in the visual and auditory modality outnumber the differences. combining data from csd assessments and profile analysis of p3 topography support the hypothesis of multiple generators of p3 that are differentially active in processing stimuli from different sensory modalities and are not symmetrically distributed between the two hemispheres.
running time analysis of the ($$1+1$$1+1)-ea for onemax and leadingones under bit-wise noise a combination tow and pressure relief valve for use in a hydraulic fluid circuit used in a hydraulically driven wide area lawn mower. the valve includes a cylindrical valve body having a hexagonal head. a slideable valve tip with a shank and a valve head has its shank slidably mounted within the valve body. the valve tip is biased by a spring to move in a direction away from the hex head. in operation, the valve is inserted into a suitable chamber placed in series with a bypass passage. the valve tends to block the bypass passage under steady state conditions. when a surge in hydraulic pressure occurs, as would occur in response to operator input or at startup, the hydraulic fluid overcomes the bias of the spring and urges the valve tip away from the otherwise blocked orifice which links the bypass passage to the chamber. opening the orifice tends to diminish the magnitude of the pressure peak and helps eliminate jerky starts of the mower. the spring eventually overcomes the reduced hydraulic fluid pressure and returns the head of the valve tip into a sealed relationship with the bypass passage orifice. a shoulder nut permits the valve to be secured at a fixed position within the chamber. varying the position of the valve within the chamber permits adjustment of the absolute value of the peak pressure which will be reached within the bypass passage. loosening the valve further permits its use as a tow valve, so that the associated mower can be moved without skidding of the mower tires or actually starting the mower engine. closing the valve further permits maximum operating pressure availability for larger and heavier equipment.
genome-wide identification, classification and expression analysis of ghmp genes family in arabidopsis thaliana kinases that catalyze phosphorylation of sugars, called here sugar kinases, can be divided into at least three distinct nonhomologous families. the first is the hexokinase family, which contains many prokaryotic and eukaryotic sugar kinases with diverse specificities, including a new member, rhamnokinase from salmonella typhimurium. the three‐dimensional structure of hexokinase is known and can be used to build models of functionally important regions of other kinases in this family. the second is the ribokinase family, of unknown three‐dimensional structure, and comprises pro‐ and eukaryotic ribokinases, bacterial fructokinases, the minor 6‐phosphofructokinase 2 from escherichia coli, 6‐phosphotagatokinase, 1‐phosphofructokinase, and, possibly, inosine‐guanosine kinase. the third family, also of unknown three‐dimensional structure, contains several bacterial and yeast galactokinases and eukaryotic mevalonate and phosphomevalonate kinases and may have a substrate binding region in common with homoserine kinases.
extended effects of air pollution on cardiopulmonary mortality in vienna air pollution consists of both gaseous and particulate-matter pollutants. the former include nitrogen dioxide (no2), ozone (o3), and sulphur dioxide (so2). the latter consist of particulate matter of varying aerodynamic diameter, as defined by cutoff points—for example, particles with diameters of ,10 mm (pm10) or ,2.5 mm (pm2.5). because of their small size, these particles can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and deposited in the alveoli. why should cardiologists care about ambient air? it has long been known that air pollution can adversely affect human health. extreme levels of pollution may cause markedly increased mortality rates; in this regard one often refers to the meuse valley fog of 1930 or the london smog of 1952. these episodes initiated successful efforts and legislation to reduce air pollution. nevertheless, even at current ambient pollution levels, the relation between pollution and excess morbidity and mortality still exists. however, the nature of the pollutants and the type of health effects have shifted, with a special emphasis now being placed on the heart rather than the lungs. maı̂tre et al. gathered the available epidemiological evidence on the association between coronary disease and air pollution at current ambient concentrations. from both biological and public health perspectives, one should distinguish between acute and long-term effects of air pollution.
epifluorescent direct counts of bacteria and viruses from topsoil of various desert dust storm regions. charles darwin, like others before him, collected aeolian dust over the atlantic ocean and sent it to christian gottfried ehrenberg in berlin. ehrenberg's collection is now housed in the museum of natural history and contains specimens that were gathered at the onset of the industrial revolution. geochemical analyses of this resource indicated that dust collected over the atlantic in 1838 originated from the western sahara, while molecular-microbiological methods demonstrated the presence of many viable microbes. older samples sent to ehrenberg from barbados almost two centuries ago also contained numbers of cultivable bacteria and fungi. many diverse ascomycetes, and eubacteria were found. scanning electron microscopy and cultivation suggested that bacillus megaterium, a common soil bacterium, was attached to historic sand grains, and it was inoculated onto dry sand along with a non-spore-forming control, the gram-negative soil bacterium rhizobium sp. ngr234. on sand b. megaterium quickly developed spores, which survived for extended periods and even though the numbers of ngr234 steadily declined, they were still considerable after months of incubation. thus, microbes that adhere to saharan dust can live for centuries and easily survive transport across the atlantic.
weight loss maintenance in african american women: a systematic review of the behavioral lifestyle intervention literature context behavioral weight loss interventions achieve short-term success, but re-gain is common.   objective to compare 2 weight loss maintenance interventions with a self-directed control group.   design, setting, and participants two-phase trial in which 1032 overweight or obese adults (38% african american, 63% women) with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or both who had lost at least 4 kg during a 6-month weight loss program (phase 1) were randomized to a weight-loss maintenance intervention (phase 2). enrollment at 4 academic centers occurred august 2003-july 2004 and randomization, february-december 2004. data collection was completed in june 2007.   interventions after the phase 1 weight-loss program, participants were randomized to one of the following groups for 30 months: monthly personal contact, unlimited access to an interactive technology-based intervention, or self-directed control. main outcome changes in weight from randomization.   results mean entry weight was 96.7 kg. during the initial 6-month program, mean weight loss was 8.5 kg. after randomization, weight regain occurred. participants in the personal-contact group regained less weight (4.0 kg) than those in the self-directed group (5.5 kg; mean difference at 30 months, -1.5 kg; 95% confidence interval [ci], -2.4 to -0.6 kg; p = .001). at 30 months, weight regain did not differ between the interactive technology-based (5.2 kg) and self-directed groups (5.5 kg; mean difference -0.3 kg; 95% ci, -1.2 to 0.6 kg; p = .51); however, weight regain was lower in the interactive technology-based than in the self-directed group at 18 months (mean difference, -1.1 kg; 95% ci, -1.9 to -0.4 kg; p = .003) and at 24 months (mean difference, -0.9 kg; 95% ci, -1.7 to -0.02 kg; p = .04). at 30 months, the difference between the personal-contact and interactive technology-based group was -1.2 kg (95% ci -2.1 to -0.3; p = .008). effects did not differ significantly by sex, race, age, and body mass index subgroups. overall, 71% of study participants remained below entry weight.   conclusions the majority of individuals who successfully completed an initial behavioral weight loss program maintained a weight below their initial level. monthly brief personal contact provided modest benefit in sustaining weight loss, whereas an interactive technology-based intervention provided early but transient benefit.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct00054925.
quantitative characterization of functional anatomical contributions to cognitive control under uncertainty tasks involving conflict between stimulus dimensions have been shown to activate dorsal anterior cingulate and prefrontal areas. it has been proposed that the dorsal anterior cingulate is involved a domain general process of monitoring conflict, while prefrontal areas are involved in resolving conflict. we examine three tasks that all require people to respond based on one stimulus dimension while ignoring another conflicting dimension, but which vary in the source of conflict. one of the tasks uses language stimuli (stroop effect) and two use nonlanguage spatial conflicts appropriate for children and nonhuman animals. in experiment 1, 12 participants were studied with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) while performing each of the three tasks. reaction times for each of the three tasks were significantly longer in the incongruent condition compared with the congruent condition, demonstrating that each task elicits a conflict. by studying the same people in the same session, we test the hypothesis that conflict activates a similar brain network in the three tasks. significant activations were found in the anterior cingulate and left prefrontal cortex for all three conflict tasks. within these regions, the conflict component demonstrated evidence for significant common activation across the three tasks, although the peak activation point and spatial extent were not identical. other areas demonstrated activation unique to each task. experiments 2-4 provide behavioral evidence indicating considerable independence between conflict operations involved in the tasks. the behavioral and fmri results taken together seem to argue against a single unified network for processing conflict, but instead support either distinct networks for each conflict task or a single network that monitors conflict with different sites used to resolve the conflict.
exploiting partial reconfiguration through pcie for a microphone array network emulator the use of microphone arrays for sound-source localization is a well-researched topic. the response of such sensor arrays is dependent on the quantity of microphones operating on the array. a higher number of microphones, however, increase the computational demand, making real-time response challenging. in this paper, we present a filter-and-sum based architecture and several acceleration techniques to provide accurate sound-source localization in real-time. experiments demonstrate how an accurate sound-source localization is obtained in a couple of milliseconds, independently of the number of microphones. finally, we also propose different strategies to further accelerate the sound-source localization while offering increased angular resolution.
joint position sense during a reaching task improves at targets located closer to the head but is unaffected by instruction our understanding of age-related declines in upper limb proprioceptive abilities is limited. furthermore, the extent to which physical activity might ameliorate age-related changes in proprioception is not known. upper limb proprioceptive acuity was examined in young and older (active and sedentary) right-handed adults using a wrist-position-matching task that varied in terms of processing demands. older individuals were also classified according to their participation in tasks specific to the upper limb. errors were greater for older than younger individuals. older sedentary adults showed greater errors and performed movements less smoothly than older active adults. the nonspecific group showed greater errors and longer movement times than the upper-limb-specific group. in older adults, decreased ability to perceive limb position may be related to a sedentary lifestyle and declines associated with memory and transfer of proprioceptive information. performing tasks specific to the upper limbs may reduce age-related declines in proprioception.
behavioural mechanisms of invasion and displacement in pacific island geckos (hemidactylus) since the age of exploration began, there has been a drastic breaching of biogeographic barriers that previously had isolated the continental biotas for millions of years. we explore the nature of these recent biotic exchanges and their consequences on evolutionary processes. the direct evidence of evolutionary consequences of the biotic rearrangements is of variable quality, but the results of trajectories are becoming clear as the number of studies increases. there are examples of invasive species altering the evolutionary pathway of native species by competitive exclusion, niche displacement, hybridization, introgression, predation, and ultimately extinction. invaders themselves evolve in response to their interactions with natives, as well as in response to the new abiotic environment. flexibility in behavior, and mutualistic interactions, can aid in the success of invaders in their new environment.
μ-opioid receptors: correlation of agonist efficacy for signalling with ability to activate internalization we investigated the ability of the activated μ‐opioid receptor (mor) to differentiate between myristoylated gαi1 and gαoa type g proteins, and the maximal activity of a range of synthetic and endogenous agonists to activate each g protein. membranes from hek293 cells stably expressing transfected mor were chaotrope extracted to denature endogenous g‐proteins and reconstituted with specific purified g‐proteins. the g subunits were generated in bacteria and were demonstrated to be recognised equivalently to bovine brain purified g protein by cb1 cannabinoid receptors. the ability of agonists to catalyse the mor‐dependent gdp/[35s]gtps exchange was then compared for gαi1 and gαoa. activation of mor by damgo produced a high‐affinity saturable interaction for gαoa (km=20±1 nm) but a low‐affinity interaction with gαi1 (km=116±12 nm). damgo, met‐enkephalin and leucine‐enkephalin displayed maximal g activation among the agonists evaluated. endomorphins 1 and 2, methadone and β‐endorphin activated both g to more than 75% of the maximal response, whereas fentanyl partially activated both g‐proteins. buprenorphine and morphine demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the maximal activities between gαi1 and gαoa. interestingly, damgo, morphine, endomorphins 1 and 2, displayed significant differences in the potencies for the activation of the two g. differences in maximal activity and potency, for gαi1 versus gαoa, are both indicative of agonist selective activation of g‐proteins in response to mor activation. these findings may provide a starting point for the design of drugs that demonstrate greater selectivity between these two g‐proteins and therefore produce a more limited range of effects.
obesity exacerbates sepsis-induced oxidative damage in organs there is strong evidence indicating that excess adiposity negatively impacts immune function and host defence in obese individuals. this is a review of research findings concerning the impact of obesity on the immune response to infection, including a discussion of possible mechanisms. obesity is characterised by a state of low-grade, chronic inflammation in addition to disturbed levels of circulating nutrients and metabolic hormones. the impact of these metabolic abnormalities on obesity-related comorbidities has undergone intense scrutiny over the past decade. however, relatively little is known of how the immune system and host defence are influenced by the pro-inflammatory and excess energy milieu of the obese. epidemiological data suggest obese human subjects are at greater risk for nosocomial infections, especially following surgery. additionally, the significance of altered immunity in obese human subjects is emphasised by recent studies reporting obesity to be an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality following infection with the 2009 pandemic influenza a (h1n1) virus. rodent models offer important insight into how metabolic abnormalities associated with excess body weight can impair immunity. however, more research is necessary to understand the specific aspects of immunity that are impaired and what factors are contributing to reduced immunocompetence in the obese. additionally, special consideration of how infection in this at-risk population is managed is required, given that this population may not respond optimally to antimicrobial drugs and vaccination. obesity impacts millions globally, and greater understanding of its associated physiological disturbances is a key public health concern.
polyanalgesic consensus conference—2012: recommendations to reduce morbidity and mortality in intrathecal drug delivery in the treatment of chronic pain objectives:the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intrathecal narcotics pump (itnp) as an alternative treatment for patients with pain from chronic pancreatitis (cp). itnp offers the advantages of reversibility, lower total narcotic dose, and the pancreas remaining intact.methods:thirteen patients (8 female, 5 male), with mean age 40.6 years (s.d. 9.6 years), who had experienced intractable upper abdominal pain from cp were reviewed. each patient had multiple other failed treatment modalities, including partial pancreatic resection (n=6). they were offered itnp after a successful intraspinal opioid trial. etiologies of cp included idiopathy (n=3), cystic fibrosis (n=2), alcohol (n=2), and pancreas divisum (n=6).results:the median duration of severe, intractable pain prior to itnp was 6 years (2–22 years). the median follow-up time after itnp was 29 months (range, 7–94 months). the itnp was in situ for a mean duration of 29 months (range, 0.5–94 months). seven patients had pump exchange or removal for various reasons; improvement of pain at month 53 (n=1), meningitis (n=1), meningitis with subsequent replacement (n=1), pump failure at month 31, 68, 79, and 84 (n=4). there were no deaths. the mean pain score prior to implantation (score=8.3, s.d.=0.9) was significantly higher than 1 year after (score=2.7, s.d.=1.9) (p<0.01) and last follow-up (score=0.75, s.d.=2.1) (p<0.01). the median oral narcotic dose before and 1 year after itnp were morphine sulfate equivalents 337.5 mg per day (range, 67.5–1,320) and 40 mg per day (range, 0–1,680), respectively (p<0.01). two patients were considered failures, as they still require a high dosage of both oral and intrathecal medications to control their pain, despite significant pain-score improvement. one patient who was excluded due to meningitis was also considered a failure. therefore, the overall success rate of itnp based on an intention-to-treat analysis was 76.9% (10/13). the major complications of itnp were central nervous system infection requiring pump removal (n=1), cerebrospinal fluid leak requiring laminectomy (n=1), and perispinal abscess with bacterial meningitis requiring pump removal (n=1).conclusions:this study shows the many risks and benefits of itnp. a longer follow-up is awaited; such pumps appear to be one alternative to aggressive surgical intervention. failed itnp trials leave other options open. therapeutic trials directly comparing pancreatectomy, itnp, and implanted nerve stimulators are of interest.
sex-dependent responses to increased parental effort in the pied flycatcher a fundamental premise of life‐history theory is that organisms that increase current reproductive investment suffer increased mortality. possibly the most studied life‐history phenotypic relationship is the trade‐off between parental effort and survival. however, evidence supporting this trade‐off is equivocal. here, we conducted a meta‐analysis to test the generality of this tenet. using experimental studies that manipulated parental effort in birds, we show that (i) the effect of parental effort on survival was similar across species regardless of phylogeny; (ii) individuals that experienced reduced parental effort had similar survival probabilities than control individuals, regardless of sex; and (iii) males that experienced increased parental effort were less likely to survive than control males, whereas females that experienced increased effort were just as likely to survive as control females. our results suggest that the trade‐off between parental effort and survival is more complex than previously assumed. finally, our study provides recommendations of unexplored avenues of future research into life‐history trade‐offs.
the effect of non-enzymatic glycation of extracellular matrix proteins on axonal regeneration in vitro abstract the pattern of collagenisation in peripheral nerve in diabetic polyneuropathy was examined in nerve biopsy specimens from patients with diabetic polyneuropathy in comparison with organ donor control nerves and disease controls (other neuropathies). there was increased endoneurial collagenisation both in the diabetic polyneuropathy cases and the disease controls, this predominantly involving types i and iii. type ii collagen was not detected in organ donor control nerves or in the diabetic and the disease control nerves. there was a relative increase in type vi collagen in the endoneurium in the diabetic nerves immediately surrounding groups of schwann cells. this was not a feature in the other neuropathies. the quantity of types iv, v and vi collagen was increased around the endoneurial microvessels in the diabetic patients and, to a lesser extent, in those with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (hmsn). increased deposition of types iv and v collagen was observed in the perineurium in the diabetic nerves, the latter being most evident in the innermost lamellae where the amount of laminin was possibly also increased. the diameter of the general endoneurial collagen fibrils was greater in the diabetic nerves, although this was not more than in a disease control (hmsn). the collagen fibrils that were present within the basal laminal tubes that had surrounded degenerated myelinated fibres in the diabetic nerves, and those within the onion bulbs of the hmsn cases, were of the normal endoneurial calibre. the expression of laminin by büngner bands in diabetic neuropathy did not differ from that in disease control nerves, nor were any differences detected for fibronectin. whether the changes observed are important for the impaired regenerative capacity in diabetic neuropathy requires further investigation.
kin effects on energy allocation in group-living ground squirrels. since w. d. hamilton's seminal work on the evolution of sociality, a large body of research has accumulated on how kin selection might explain the evolution of cooperation in many group-living species. our study examined the evolutionary basis of philopatry and cooperation; specifically, whether individuals benefit from the presence of close kin. we applied an individual fitness approach to a 16-year study of columbian ground squirrels (urocitellus columbianus) to investigate potential causal paths by which the presence of kin might act on individual fitness. our results indicate that individual fitness benefits resulted from associations of philopatric female kin, and support the hypothesis that increased tolerance of proximity of kin is a proximate mechanism for these benefits. the major life-history influence of kin on individual fitness was through improved reproductive success, and this benefit may have been owing to philopatric settlement of kin that were recognized through familiarization in the natal burrow. thus, we demonstrated an evolutionary basis necessary for ongoing kin-selected cooperation in columbian ground squirrels, though the mechanism of familiarity may determine which kin individuals benefit from cooperative behaviours.
are public and private r&d investments complements or substitutes? economic interest in innovation policy largely arises from the fundamental importance of innovation to social welfare and from inefficiencies in innovation in a competitive market environment. as a result, a wide variety of public innovation policies are used in practice. this study reviews the economic justifications for public innovation policies and compares the existing policy tools, paying particular attention to the finnish innovation policy environment.
inflammatory cells, microglia and mhc class ii antigen-positive cells in the spinal cord of lewis rats with acute and chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in addition to the major population of infiltrating leukocytes recovered from inflamed rat central nervous system (cns), all of which expressed high levels of leukocyte common antigen cd45, many cells were coisolated that were mrc ox42+ (complement receptor 3/cd11b) but expressed low-to-moderate levels of cd45 and major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i molecules. most cells from normal cns, in contrast, lay within this latter, cd45low population. from previous in situ immunohistochemical studies, the fortuitously isolated cd45low cells were probably resident (ramified) microglia. using irradiation chimeras, we show that resident microglia respond to inflammation by upregulating cd45, cd4, and mhc class i molecules with a minority of these cells increasing their expression of mhc class ii molecules. a 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of microglia isolated from inflamed cns provided indirect evidence that the cells had proliferated. in normal cns, a very small population of blood-derived cd45high-expressing cells are present; most mhc class ii expression is associated with these few cells and not with the resident microglia.
improving named entity recognition for morphologically rich languages using word embeddings in this paper, we present our effort to consolidate and push further the named entity recognition (ner) research for the czech language. the research in czech is based upon a non-standard basis. some systems are constructed to provide hierarchical outputs whereas the rests give flat entities. direct comparison among these system is therefore impossible. our first goal is to tackle this issue. we build our own ner system based upon conditional random fields (crf) model. it is constructed to output either flat or hierarchical named entities thus enabling an evaluation with all the known systems for czech language. we show a 3.5 – 11% absolute performance increase when compared to previously published results. as a last step we put our system in the context of the research for other languages. we show results for english, spanish and dutch corpora. we can conclude that our system provides solid results when compared to the foreign state of the art.
reduced gene expression of intestinal alpha-defensins predicts diarrhea in a cohort of african adults. to determine the response of the small intestinal mucosa to environmental conditions, we studied changes in mucosal architecture and function in a longitudinal cohort study in african adults. over three consecutive years, 238 adults submitted monthly stool samples for parasitologic and bacteriologic analysis and underwent an annual endoscopic jejunal biopsy for mucosal morphometry. absorption and permeability assays were performed on the same day as the enteroscopy. variation in mucosal architecture and function was correlated with environmental factors and stool microbiology. the whole cohort had structural and functional evidence of tropical enteropathy, but structure and function were only weakly correlated. there were marked changes over time, and seasonal variation was observed in villous height (16%), xylose recovery (16%), and permeability (28%). asymptomatic intestinal infections were common. enteropathy was more severe in participants with citrobacter rodentium or hookworm ova in the stool sample taken one month before the investigations were performed.
critical analysis of e-health readiness assessment frameworks: suitability for application in developing countries background: concept of e-readiness is used in many areas such as e-business, e-commerce, e-government, and e-banking. in terms of healthcare, e-readiness is a rather new concept, and is propounded under the title of e-healthcare. e-health readiness refers to the readiness of communities and healthcare institutions for the expected changes brought by programs related to information and communications technology (lct). the present research is conducted aiming at designing e-health readiness assessment framework (ehraf) in iran. methods: the e-health readiness assessment framework was designed based on reviewing literature on e-readiness assessment models and opinions of ict and health experts. in the next step, delphi method was used to develop and test the designed framework. three questionnaires developed to test and modify the model while determining weights of the indices; afterward they were either sent to experts through email or delivered to them in face. results: the designed framework approved with 4 dimensions, 11 constituents and 58 indices. technical readiness had the highest importance coefficient (0.256099), and the other dimensions were of the next levels of coefficient importance: core readiness (0.25520), social communication readiness (0.244658), and engagement readiness (0.244039). conclusion: the framework presents the movement route and investment priorities in e-health in iran. the proposed framework is a good instrument for measuring the e-readiness in health centers in iran, and for identifying strengths and weaknesses of these centers to access ict and its implementation for more effectiveness and for analyzing digital divide between them, as well.
hnrnp-q1 represses nascent axon growth in cortical neurons by inhibiting gap-43 mrna translation during axonal regeneration synthesis of different growth‐associated proteins is increased. as yet there is no clear picture of the specific contribution made by the transcriptional and post‐transcriptional machinery that provides the gene products necessary for process outgrowth. here we focus our study on the transcriptional processes in neurons by using intron‐directed in situ hybridization to the primary transcript of a brain growth protein gap‐43. in most brain regions, levels of primary transcript expression of gap‐43 were highly correlated with levels of its mrna. however, there were notable dissociations: in hippocampal granule cells, high levels of primary transcript were evident yet no gap‐43 mrna was detected. in locus coeruleus the reverse was true; there were high levels of gap‐43 mrna but no detectable primary transcript. a primary transcript antitermination mechanism is proposed to explain the first dissociation, and a post‐transcriptional mrna stabilization mechanism to explain the second. transcriptional activation during nerve regeneration was monitored by assessing primary transcript induction of gap‐43 in mouse facial motor neurons. this induction, as well as its mrna, was restricted to the side of the facial nerve crush. increases were first observed at 24 h with a rapid increase in both measures up to 3 days. to our knowledge, this is the first in vivo evidence demonstrating transcriptional activation of a brain growth protein in regenerating neurons. the present study points to the gap‐43 transcriptional mechanism as a key determinant of gap‐43 synthesis. along with the recruitment of post‐transcriptional mechanisms, such synthesis occurs in response to both intrinsic developmental programs and extrinsic environmental signals.

differences in gastric carcinoma microenvironment stratify according to ebv infection intensity: implications for possible immune adjuvant therapy merkel cell carcinoma (mcc) is a rare but aggressive human skin cancer that typically affects elderly and immunosuppressed individuals, a feature suggestive of an infectious origin. we studied mcc samples by digital transcriptome subtraction and detected a fusion transcript between a previously undescribed virus t antigen and a human receptor tyrosine phosphatase. further investigation led to identification and sequence analysis of the 5387–base-pair genome of a previously unknown polyomavirus that we call merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv or mcpyv). mcv sequences were detected in 8 of 10 (80%) mcc tumors but only 5 of 59 (8%) control tissues from various body sites and 4 of 25 (16%) control skin tissues. in six of eight mcv-positive mccs, viral dna was integrated within the tumor genome in a clonal pattern, suggesting that mcv infection and integration preceded clonal expansion of the tumor cells. thus, mcv may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of mcc.
the monoaminergic modulation of sensory-mediated aversive responses in caenorhabditis elegans requires glutamatergic/peptidergic cotransmission neuropeptides play critical roles in synaptic signaling in all nervous systems. unlike classical neurotransmitters, peptidergic neurotransmitters are encoded as preproproteins that are posttranslationally processed to yield bioactive neuropeptides. to identify novel peptidergic neurotransmitters, the caenorhabditis elegans genome was searched for predicted proteins with the structural hallmarks of neuropeptide preproproteins. thirty-two c. elegans neuropeptide-like protein (nlp) genes were identified. the nlp genes define at least 11 families of putative neuropeptides with unique motifs; similar expressed sequence tags were identified in other invertebrate species for all 11 families. six of these families are defined by putative bioactive motifs (fafa, ggxyamide, mrxamide, lqfamide, lxdxamide, and ggaraf); the remaining five families are related to allatostatin, myomodulin, buccalin/drosulfakinin, orcokinin, and apgwamide neuropeptides (mgl/famide, frpamide, msfamide, gfxgf, and yggwamide families, respectively). most c. elegans nlp gene expression is in neurons. the c. elegans nlp genes and similar genes encoding putative neuropeptides in other species are likely to play diverse roles in nervous system function.
seeing sound acoustic sensors play an important role in augmenting the traditional biodiversity monitoring activities carried out by ecologists and conservation biologists. with this ability however comes the burden of analysing large volumes of complex acoustic data. given the complexity of acoustic sensor data, fully automated analysis for a wide range of species is still a significant challenge. this research investigates the use of citizen scientists to analyse large volumes of environmental acoustic data in order to identify bird species. specifically, it investigates ways in which the efficiency of a user can be improved through the use of species identification tools and the use of reputation models to predict the accuracy of users with unidentified skill levels. initial experimental results are reported.
evidence of neurodegeneration in obstructive sleep apnea: relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly abstractthe purpose of the present study was to compare exercise status during the follicular (fp) and luteal (lp) phases of the menstrual cycle of a single group of young, sedentary women, where the marked differential in the blood concentrations of 17β-oestradiol ([e2]) and progesterone ([p4]) has the potential to alter the metabolic response to exercise. fourteen females [21.8 (4.0) years, peak oxygen uptake (v̇o2peak) <45 ml·kg −1·min−1] performed both incremental exercise to exhaustion and steady-state submaximal cycle ergometer exercise while measurements were made of several metabolic and hormonal variables. with the incremental exercise test, time to exhaustion, maximal power output and total work done were not different between the two phases, nor were the absolute values for v̇o2peak or the corresponding values for ventilation (v̇e), respiratory frequency (fr) and heart rate (hr). resting, end-exercise and peak (post-exercise) plasma lactate concentrations and the lactate threshold were not different between the two phases either. however, as the workloads increased during the incremental protocol, plasma lactate concentration, carbon dioxide output (v̇co2) and the respiratory exchange ratio (rer) all were lower during lp, while oxygen uptake (v̇o2) was higher. with steady-state submaximal exercise, at workloads corresponding to 25% and 75% of menstrual cycle phase-specific v̇o2peak, v̇o2 and the oxygen pulse (v̇o2/hr) were higher and rer and plasma lactate concentration lower during lp. regardless of phase, [e2] increased with both incremental and steady-state submaximal exercise, while [p4] was unchanged. it is concluded that while exercise capacity, as defined by v̇o2peak and the lactate threshold, is unaffected by cycle phase in young, sedentary women, the metabolic responses in the lp during both incremental and steady-state submaximal exercise suggest a greater dependence on fat as an energy source.
regulation by sirpα of dendritic cell homeostasis in lymphoid tissues. signal regulatory protein (sirp)alpha, also known as shps-1 or sirpa, is a transmembrane protein that binds to the protein tyrosine phosphatases shp-1 and shp-2 through its cytoplasmic region and is predominantly expressed in neurons, dendritic cells and macrophages. cd47, a widely expressed transmembrane protein, is a ligand for sirpalpha, with the two proteins constituting a cell-cell communication system. the interaction of sirpalpha with cd47 is important for the regulation of migration and phagocytosis. recent studies have implicated the cd47-sirpalpha signalling pathway in immune homeostasis and in regulation of neuronal networks. advances in the structural and functional analyses of the cd47-sirpalpha signalling pathway now provide exciting hints of the therapeutic benefits of manipulating this signalling system in autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders.
dual-energy contrast-enhanced mammography. background experimental evidence suggests that the growth of a tumor beyond a certain size requires angiogenesis, which may also permit metastasis. to investigate how tumor angiogenesis correlates with metastases in breast carcinoma, we counted microvessels (capillaries and venules) and graded the density of microvessels within the initial invasive carcinomas of 49 patients (30 with metastases and 19 without).   methods using light microscopy, we highlighted the vessels by staining their endothelial cells immunocytochemically for factor viii. the microvessels were carefully counted (per 200x field), and their density was graded (1 to 4+), in the most active areas of neovascularization, without knowledge of the outcome in the patient, the presence or absence of metastases, or any other pertinent variable.   results both microvessel counts and density grades correlated with metastatic disease. the mean (+/- sd) count and grade in the patients with metastases were 101 +/- 49.3 and 2.95 +/- 1.00 vessels, respectively. the corresponding values in the patients without metastases were significantly lower--45 +/- 21.1 and 1.38 +/- 0.82 (p = 0.003 and p less than or equal to 0.001, respectively). for each 10-microvessel increase in the count per 200x field, there was a 1.59-fold increase in the risk of metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 2.12; p = 0.003). the microvessel count and density grade also correlated with distant metastases. for each 10-microvessel increase in the vessel count per 200x field, there was a 1.17-fold increase in the risk of distant metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34; p = 0.029).   conclusions the number of microvessels per 200x field in the areas of most intensive neovascularization in an invasive breast carcinoma may be an independent predictor of metastatic disease either in axillary lymph nodes or at distant sites (or both). assessment of tumor angiogenesis may therefore prove valuable in selecting patients with early breast carcinoma for aggressive therapy.
a virus-encoded cell–cell fusion machine dependent on surrogate adhesins this review analyses recent structural results that provide clues about a possible molecular mechanism for the transmission of a fusogenic signal among the envelope glycoproteins of the herpes simplex virus on receptor binding by glycoprotein gd. this signal triggers the membrane‐fusion machinery of the virus—contained in glycoproteins gb, gh and gl—to induce the merging of viral and cellular membranes, and to allow virus entry into target cells. this activating process parallels that of γ‐retroviruses, in which receptor binding by the amino‐terminal domain of the envelope protein activates the fusogenic potential of the virion in a similar way, despite the different organization of the envelope complexes of these two types of viruses. therefore, the new structural results on the interaction of gd with its receptors might also provide insights into the mechanism of fusogenic signal transmission in γ‐retroviruses. furthermore, the fusion activation parallels with retroviruses, together with the recently reported structural homology of gb with the rhabdovirus envelope glycoprotein indicate that the complex entry apparatus of herpesviruses appears to be functionally related to that of simpler enveloped viruses.
gender-specific association of polymorphisms in the 5′-utr and 3′-utr of vegf gene with hypertensive patients vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) is a cytokine involved in angiogenesis and upregulated during adaptive heart hypertrophy. downregulation of vegf seems to trigger the transition from adaptive to dilated cardiac hypertrophy. we investigated for the first time whether 3 clinically relevant polymorphisms in the vegfa gene are associated with altered echocardiographic parameters in hypertensive patients. we determined genotypes for 3 polymorphisms in vegfa promoter in 179 hypertensive patients and 169 healthy controls: g.-2578c>a (rs699947), g.-1154g>a (rs1570360), and g.-634g>c (rs2010963). although the variant genotypes of the g.-634g>c (gc + cc) were associated with reduced left ventricular mass index (p = 0.030), the variant genotypes for the g.-1154g>a (ga + aa) were associated with reduced ejection fraction (p = 0.008). in addition, we found that vegfa haplotypes were associated with altered ejection fraction (p = 0.024). the aag haplotype was associated with reduced ejection fraction (p = 0.006), whereas the agg haplotype was associated with increased ejection fraction (p = 0.010). our results suggest that vegf polymorphisms affect cardiac remodeling. genotypes for vegfa polymorphisms can be useful to help to identify hypertensive patients at greater intrinsic risk for heart failure.
the saccharomyces cerevisiae histone chaperone rtt106 mediates the cell cycle recruitment of swi/snf and rsc to the hir-dependent histone genes genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the evolutionarily conserved swi/snf complex acts at a subset of genes to help transcriptional activators function on chromatin templates. the mechanism by which this complex is targeted to specific chromosomal loci remains unknown. we show that swi/snf is required for expression of the yeast histone hta1-htb1 locus because of the role of hir1p and hir2p corepressors in negatively regulating transcription. snf5p, snf2p/swi2p, and swi3p, three components of the yeast swi/snf complex, coimmunoprecipitate with each hir protein, and snf5p is maximally associated with the hta1-htb1 promoter when the hir-based repression system is intact and the swi/snf complex is functional. the data support a role for the hir repressors in the gene-specific targeting of swi/snf.
the role of galanin system in modulating depression, anxiety, and addiction-like behaviors after chronic restraint stress stressors can exert a wide variety of responses, ranging from adaptive responses to pathological changes; moreover, recent studies suggest that mild stressors can attenuate the response of a system to major stressful events. we have previously shown that 2‐week exposure to cold, a comparatively mild inescapable stressor, induced a pronounced reduction in ventral tegmental area (vta) dopamine (da) neuron activity, whereas restraint stress increases da neuron activity. however, it is not known if these stressors differentially impact the vta in a region‐specific manner, if they differentially impact behavioral responses, or whether the effects of such different stressors are additive or antagonistic with regard to their impact on da neuron firing. to address these questions, single‐unit extracellular recordings were performed in anesthetized control rats and rats exposed to chronic cold, and tested after delivery of a 2‐h restraint session. chronic cold stress strongly attenuated the number of da neurons firing in the vta, and this effect occurred primarily in the medial and central vta regions that preferentially project to reward‐related ventral striatal regions. chronic cold exposure also prevented the pronounced increase in da neuron population activity without affecting the behavioral sensitization to amphetamine produced by restraint stress. taken together, these data show that a prolonged inescapable mild stressor can induce plastic changes that attenuate the da system response to acute stress.
magno and parvo stimuli affect illusory directional hearing in normal and dyslexic readers dyslexia is a common disorder with largely unknown pathophysiology. we tested ten dyslexic adults and 20 control subjects with trains of binaural clicks which led to illusory sound movements at short click intervals. in controls, the illusion disappeared at intervals exceeding 90-120 ms while in the dyslexics it persisted up to intervals of 250-500 ms. dyslexic adults thus seem to have a deficit in the processing of rapid sound sequences, which is also manifested in significant delays in their conscious auditory percepts. this pathophysiological abnormality seems to persist throughout life.
impact of geographic location on vitamin d status and bone mineral density although the importance of solar radiation for vitamin d3 synthesis in the human body is well known, the solar exposure time required to prevent vitamin d deficiency has not been determined in japan. this study attempted to identify the time of solar exposure required for vitamin d3 synthesis in the body by season, time of day, and geographic location (sapporo, tsukuba, and naha) using both numerical simulations and observations. according to the numerical simulation for tsukuba at noon in july under a cloudless sky, 3.5 min of solar exposure are required to produce 5.5 μg vitamin d3 per 600 cm2 skin corresponding to the area of a face and the back of a pair of hands without ingestion from foods. in contrast, it took 76.4 min to produce the same quantity of vitamin d3 at sapporo in december, at noon under a cloudless sky. the necessary exposure time varied considerably with the time of the day. for tsukuba at noon in december, 22.4 min were required, but 106.0 min were required at 09:00 and 271.3 min were required at 15:00 for the same meteorological conditions. naha receives high levels of ultraviolet radiation allowing vitamin d3 synthesis almost throughout the year.
rap1 and canoe/afadin are essential for establishment of apical–basal polarity in the drosophila embryo regulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction is essential for the normal physiology of metazoans and is important in many diseases. integrin adhesion receptors can rapidly increase their affinity (integrin activation) in response to intracellular signaling events in a process termed inside-out signaling. the transmembrane domains of integrins and their interactions with the membrane are important in inside-out signaling. moreover, integrin activation is tightly regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways. here, we review recent progress in understanding how the membrane environment can, in cooperation with integrin-binding proteins, regulate integrin activation.
isodicentric yq mosaicism presenting as infertility and maturation arrest without altered sry and azf regions massive palindromes in the human y chromosome harbor mirror-image gene pairs essential for spermatogenesis. during evolution, these gene pairs have been maintained by intrapalindrome, arm-to-arm recombination. the mechanism of intrapalindrome recombination and risk of harmful effects are unknown. we report 51 patients with isodicentric y (idicy) chromosomes formed by homologous crossing over between opposing arms of palindromes on sister chromatids. these ectopic recombination events occur at nearly all y-linked palindromes. based on our findings, we propose that intrapalindrome sequence identity is maintained via noncrossover pathways of homologous recombination. dna double-strand breaks that initiate these pathways can be alternatively resolved by crossing over between sister chromatids to form idicy chromosomes, with clinical consequences ranging from spermatogenic failure to sex reversal and turner syndrome. our observations imply that crossover and noncrossover pathways are active in nearly all y-linked palindromes, exposing an achilles' heel in the mechanism that preserves palindrome-borne genes.
an attempt towards simultaneous biobased solvent based extraction of proteins and enzymatic saccharification of cellulosic materials from distiller's grains and solubles. ddgs and wet distillers' grains are the major co-products of the dry grind ethanol facilities. as they are mainly used as animal feed, a typical compositional analysis of the ddgs and wet distillers' grains mainly focuses on defining the feedstock's nutritional characteristics. with an increasing demand for fuel ethanol, the ddgs and wet distillers' grains are viewed as a potential bridge feedstock for ethanol production from other cellulosic biomass. the introduction of ddgs or wet distillers' grains as an additional feed to the existing dry grind plants for increased ethanol yield requires a different approach to the compositional analysis of the material. rather than focusing on its nutritional value, this new approach aims at determining more detailed chemical composition, especially on polymeric sugars such as cellulose, starch and xylan, which release fermentable sugars upon enzymatic hydrolysis. in this paper we present a detailed and complete compositional analysis procedure suggested for ddgs and wet distillers' grains, as well as the resulting compositions completed by three different research groups. polymeric sugars, crude protein, crude oil and ash contents of ddgs and wet distillers' grains were accurately and reproducibly determined by the compositional analysis procedure described in this paper.
kin effects on energy allocation in group-living ground squirrels. since w. d. hamilton's seminal work on the evolution of sociality, a large body of research has accumulated on how kin selection might explain the evolution of cooperation in many group-living species. our study examined the evolutionary basis of philopatry and cooperation; specifically, whether individuals benefit from the presence of close kin. we applied an individual fitness approach to a 16-year study of columbian ground squirrels (urocitellus columbianus) to investigate potential causal paths by which the presence of kin might act on individual fitness. our results indicate that individual fitness benefits resulted from associations of philopatric female kin, and support the hypothesis that increased tolerance of proximity of kin is a proximate mechanism for these benefits. the major life-history influence of kin on individual fitness was through improved reproductive success, and this benefit may have been owing to philopatric settlement of kin that were recognized through familiarization in the natal burrow. thus, we demonstrated an evolutionary basis necessary for ongoing kin-selected cooperation in columbian ground squirrels, though the mechanism of familiarity may determine which kin individuals benefit from cooperative behaviours.
a taste for novelty in invading house sparrows, passer domesticus biotic invaders are species that establish a new range in which they proliferate, spread, and persist to the detriment of the environment. they are the most important ecological outcomes from the unprecedented alterations in the distribution of the earth's biota brought about largely through human transport and commerce. in a world without borders, few if any areas remain sheltered from these im- migrations. the fate of immigrants is decidedly mixed. few survive the hazards of chronic and stochastic forces, and only a small fraction become naturalized. in turn, some naturalized species do become invasive. there are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites; others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native communities. ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and uncontrollable. whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) animal invaders can cause extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing, competition, and habitat alteration. (2) plant invaders can completely alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival of native species. (3) in agriculture, the principal pests of temperate crops are nonindigenous, and the combined expenses of pest control and crop losses constitute an onerous "tax" on food, fiber, and forage production. (4) the global cost of virulent plant and animal diseases caused by parasites transported to new ranges and presented with susceptible new hosts is currently incalculable. identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their dispersal and establishment con- stitutes an enormous challenge to both conservation and international commerce. detection and management when exclusion fails have proved daunting for varied reasons: (1) efforts to identify general attributes of future invaders have often been inconclusive. (2) predicting susceptible locales for future invasions seems even more problematic, given the enormous differences in the rates of arrival among potential invaders. (3) eradication of an established invader is rare, and control efforts vary enormously in their efficacy. successful control, however, depends more on commitment and continuing diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools themselves. (4) control of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a long-term, ecosystem- wide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on battling individual invaders. (5) prevention of invasions is much less costly than post-entry control. revamping national and international quarantine laws by adopting a "guilty until proven innocent" approach would be a productive first step. failure to address the issue of biotic invasions could effectively result in severe global consequences, including wholesale loss of agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources in some regions, disruption of the ecological processes that supply natural services on which human enterprise depends, and the creation of homogeneous, impoverished ecosystems composed of cosmopolitan species. given their current scale, biotic invasions have taken their place alongside human-driven atmospheric and oceanic alterations as major agents of global change. left unchecked, they will influence these other forces in profound but still unpredictable ways.
knot resolution algorithm and its performance evaluation the author describes a series of deadlock detection techniques based on centralized, hierarchical, and distributed control organizations. the point of view is that of practical implications. an up-to-date and comprehensive survey of deadlock detection algorithms is presented, their merits and drawbacks are discussed, and their performances (delays as well as message complexity) are compared. related issues such as correctness of the algorithms, performance of the algorithms, and deadlock resolution, which require further research are examined.<<etx>>
thermal degradation and fire behaviour of thermal insulation materials based on food crop by-products abstract dynamic tg analysis under nitrogen was used to investigate the thermal decomposition processes of 10 types of natural fibers commonly used in the polymer composite industry. these fibers included wood, bamboo, agricultural residue, and bast fibers. various degradation models including the kissinger, friedman, flynn–wall–ozawa, and modified coats–redfern methods were used to determine the apparent activation energy of these fibers. for most natural fibers approximately 60% of the thermal decomposition occurred within a temperature range between 215 and 310 °c. the result also showed that an apparent activation energy of 160–170 kj/mol was obtained for most of the selected fibers throughout the polymer processing temperature range. these activation energy values allow developing a simplified approach to understand the thermal decomposition behavior of natural fibers as a function of polymer composite processing.
neuroendocrine-immune interaction: evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that maintain allostasis in an ever-changing environment. parent-offspring conflicts lead the offspring to evolve reliable signals of individual quality, including parasite burden, which may allow parents to adaptively modulate investment in the progeny. sex-related variation in offspring reproductive value, however, may entail differential investment in sons and daughters. here, we experimentally manipulated offspring condition in the barn swallow (hirundo rustica) by subjecting nestlings to an immune challenge (injection with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, lps) that simulates a bacterial infection, and assessed the effects on growth, feather quality, expression of morphological (gape coloration) and behavioral (posture) begging displays involved in parent-offspring communication, as well as on food allocation by parents. compared to sham-injected controls, lps-treated chicks suffered a depression of body mass and a reduction of palate color saturation. in addition, lps treatment resulted in lower feather quality, with an increase in the occurrence of fault bars on wing feathers. the color of beak flanges, feather growth and the intensity of postural begging were affected by lps treatment only in females, suggesting that chicks of either sex are differently susceptible to the immune challenge. however, irrespective of the effects of lps, parents equally allocated food among control and challenged offspring both under normal food provisioning and after a short period of food deprivation of the chicks. these results indicate that bacterial infection and the associated immune response entail different costs to offspring of either sex, but a decrease in nestling conditions does not affect parental care allocation, possibly because the barn swallow adopts a brood-survival strategy. finally, we showed that physiological stress induced by pathogens impairs plumage quality, a previously neglected major negative impact of bacterial infection which could severely affect fitness, particularly among long-distance migratory birds.
sculpting 3d spatial selectivity with pairs of 2d pulses: a comparison of methods. the understanding and control of spin dynamics play a fundamental role in modern nmr imaging, for devising new ways to monitor an object's density as well as for enabling the tailored excitation of spins in space. it has recently been shown that by relying on spatiotemporal encoding (spen), new forms of single-scan multidimensional nmr spectroscopy and imaging become feasible. the present study extends those imaging developments, by introducing a new class of multidimensional excitation pulses that relies on spen concepts. we focus in particular on a family of "hybrid" 2d radiofrequency (rf) pulses that operate in both direct and reciprocal excitation space, and which can spatially sculpt the spin magnetization in manners that are beyond the reach of sequential 1d pulse shaping. these spen-based 2d pulses are compatible with a majority of single- and multi-scan imaging techniques. like the corresponding spen-based hybrid 2d acquisitions, these pulses can benefit from a high robustness against field inhomogeneities and/or offset effects that affect their k-space-based counterparts. these properties are analyzed, and illustrated with numerical simulations and model experiments.
analysis of the modulated acoustic radiation-force profile for a dual-beam confocal geometry. we describe theoretical principles of an imaging modality that uses the acoustic response of an object to a highly localized dynamic radiation force of an ultrasound field. in this method, named ultrasound-stimulated vibro-acoustography (usva), ultrasound is used to exert a low-frequency (in khz range) force on the object. in response, a portion of the object vibrates sinusoidally in a pattern determined by its viscoelastic properties. the acoustic emission field resulting from object vibration is detected and used to form an image that represents both the ultrasonic and low-frequency (khz range) mechanical characteristics of the object. we report the relation between the emitted acoustic field and the incident ultrasonic pressure field in terms of object parameters. also, we present the point-spread function of the imaging system. the experimental images in this report have a resolution of about 700 microm, high contrast, and high signal-to-noise ratio. usva is sensitive enough to detect object motions on the order of nanometers. possible applications include medical imaging and material evaluation.
towards optimal transport with global invariances state-of-the-art methods for learning cross-lingual word embeddings have relied on bilingual dictionaries or parallel corpora. recent studies showed that the need for parallel data supervision can be alleviated with character-level information. while these methods showed encouraging results, they are not on par with their supervised counterparts and are limited to pairs of languages sharing a common alphabet. in this work, we show that we can build a bilingual dictionary between two languages without using any parallel corpora, by aligning monolingual word embedding spaces in an unsupervised way. without using any character information, our model even outperforms existing supervised methods on cross-lingual tasks for some language pairs. our experiments demonstrate that our method works very well also for distant language pairs, like english-russian or english-chinese. we finally describe experiments on the english-esperanto low-resource language pair, on which there only exists a limited amount of parallel data, to show the potential impact of our method in fully unsupervised machine translation. our code, embeddings and dictionaries are publicly available.
social cognitive neuroscience and humanoid robotics this paper presents a 50-d.o.f. humanoid robot, computational brain (cb). cb is a humanoid robot created for exploring the underlying processing of the human brain while dealing with the real world. we place our investigations within real—world contexts, as humans do. in so doing, we focus on utilizing a system that is closer to humans—in sensing, kinematics configuration and performance. we present the real-time network-based architecture for the control of all 50 d.o.f. the controller provides full position/velocity/force sensing and control at 1 khz, allowing us the flexibility in deriving various forms of control. a dynamic simulator is also presented; the simulator acts as a realistic testbed for our controllers and acts as a common interface to our humanoid robots. a contact model developed to allow better validation of our controllers prior to final testing on the physical robot is also presented. three aspects of the system are highlighted in this paper: (i) physical power for walking, (ii) full-body compliant control—physical interactions and (iii) perception and control—visual ocular-motor responses.
age-related changes in motor control during unimanual movements we investigate age- and expertise-related individual differences in component processes of rhythmic timing. to this end we apply analysis of covariance structure and symbolic dynamics to time series obtained from performances of two bimanual rhythm tasks at different tempos. results show similar effects for peripheral motor implementation and timekeeper execution in young and older amateur pianists. older participants show specific problems with temporal sequencing processes (specification of different target intervals). expert pianists show lower variability in both motor implementation and timekeeper execution and they accommodate to the sequencing demands of different tempos by selectively relying on integrated or parallel timing. we argue that the observed timing control characteristics reflect individuals' adaptations to internal processing limitations and performance constraints.
weight loss maintenance in african american women: a systematic review of the behavioral lifestyle intervention literature context behavioral weight loss interventions achieve short-term success, but re-gain is common.   objective to compare 2 weight loss maintenance interventions with a self-directed control group.   design, setting, and participants two-phase trial in which 1032 overweight or obese adults (38% african american, 63% women) with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or both who had lost at least 4 kg during a 6-month weight loss program (phase 1) were randomized to a weight-loss maintenance intervention (phase 2). enrollment at 4 academic centers occurred august 2003-july 2004 and randomization, february-december 2004. data collection was completed in june 2007.   interventions after the phase 1 weight-loss program, participants were randomized to one of the following groups for 30 months: monthly personal contact, unlimited access to an interactive technology-based intervention, or self-directed control. main outcome changes in weight from randomization.   results mean entry weight was 96.7 kg. during the initial 6-month program, mean weight loss was 8.5 kg. after randomization, weight regain occurred. participants in the personal-contact group regained less weight (4.0 kg) than those in the self-directed group (5.5 kg; mean difference at 30 months, -1.5 kg; 95% confidence interval [ci], -2.4 to -0.6 kg; p = .001). at 30 months, weight regain did not differ between the interactive technology-based (5.2 kg) and self-directed groups (5.5 kg; mean difference -0.3 kg; 95% ci, -1.2 to 0.6 kg; p = .51); however, weight regain was lower in the interactive technology-based than in the self-directed group at 18 months (mean difference, -1.1 kg; 95% ci, -1.9 to -0.4 kg; p = .003) and at 24 months (mean difference, -0.9 kg; 95% ci, -1.7 to -0.02 kg; p = .04). at 30 months, the difference between the personal-contact and interactive technology-based group was -1.2 kg (95% ci -2.1 to -0.3; p = .008). effects did not differ significantly by sex, race, age, and body mass index subgroups. overall, 71% of study participants remained below entry weight.   conclusions the majority of individuals who successfully completed an initial behavioral weight loss program maintained a weight below their initial level. monthly brief personal contact provided modest benefit in sustaining weight loss, whereas an interactive technology-based intervention provided early but transient benefit.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct00054925.
hmgb1/2 can target dna for illegitimate cleavage by the rag1/2 complex v(d)j recombination is a process integral to lymphocyte development. however, this process is not always benign, since certain lymphoid malignancies exhibit recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations and deletions, that harbor molecular signatures suggesting an origin from aberrant v(d)j recombination. translocations involving lmo2, tal1, ttg-1, and hox11, as well as a recurrent interstitial deletion at 1p32 involving sil/scl, are cited examples of illegitimate v(d)j recombination. previous studies using extrachromosomal substrates reveal that cryptic recombination signal sequences (crsss) identified near the translocation breakpoint in these examples support v(d)j recombination with efficiencies ranging from about 30- to 20,000-fold less than bona fide v(d)j recombination signals. to understand the molecular basis for these large differences, we investigated the binding and cleavage of these crsss by the rag1/2 proteins that initiate v(d)j recombination. we find that the rag proteins comparably bind all crsss tested, albeit more poorly than a consensus rss. we show that four crsss that support levels of v(d)j recombination above background levels in cell culture (lmo2, tal1, ttg-1, and sil) are also cleaved by the rag proteins in vitro with efficiencies ranging from 18 to 70% of a consensus rss. cleavage of lmo2 and ttg-1 by the rag proteins can also be detected in cell culture using ligation-mediated pcr. in contrast, hox11 and scl are nicked but not cleaved efficiently in vitro, and cleavage at other adventitious sites in plasmid substrates may also limit the ability to detect recombination activity at these crsss in cell culture.
spectral normalization between landsat-8/oli, landsat- 7/etm+ and cbers-4/mux bands through linear regression and spectral unmixing satellite image time series are becoming increasingly available and will continue to do so in the coming years thanks to the launch of space missions which aim at providing a coverage of the earth every few days with high spatial resolution. in the case of optical imagery, it will be possible to produce land use and cover change maps with detailed nomenclatures. however, due to meteorological phenomena, such as clouds, these time series will become irregular in terms of temporal sampling, and one will need to compare time series with different lengths. in this paper, we present an approach to image time series analysis which is able to deal with irregularly sampled series and which also allows the comparison of pairs of time series where each element of the pair has a different number of samples. we present the dynamic time warping from a theoretical point of view and illustrate its capabilities with two applications to real-time series.
sars: responding to an unknown virus background severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) is continuing to spread around the world. all hospitals must be prepared to care for patients with sars. thus, it is important to understand the transmission of this disease in hospitals and to evaluate methods for its containment in health care institutions. we describe how we cared for the first 2 patients with sars admitted to our 419-bed community hospital in richmond hill, ont., and the response to a sars outbreak within our institution.   methods we collected clinical and epidemiological data about patients and health care workers at our institution who during a 13-day period had a potential unprotected exposure to 2 patients whose signs and symptoms were subsequently identified as meeting the case definition for probable sars. the index case at our hospital was a patient who was transferred to our intensive care unit (icu) from a referral hospital on mar. 16, 2003, where he had been in close proximity to the son of the individual with the first reported case of sars in toronto. after 13 days in the icu, a diagnosis of probable sars was reached for our index case. immediately upon diagnosis of our index case, respiratory isolation and barrier precautions were instituted throughout our hospital and maintained for a period of 10 days, which is the estimated maximum incubation period reported for this disease. aggressive surveillance measures among hospital staff, patients and visitors were also maintained during this time.   results during the surveillance period, 15 individuals (10 hospital staff, 3 patients and 2 visitors) were identified as meeting the case definition for probable or suspected sars, in addition to our index case. all but 1 individual had had direct contact with a symptomatic patient with sars during the period of unprotected exposure. no additional cases were identified after infection control precautions had been implemented for 8 days. no cases of secondary transmission were identified in the 21 days following the implementation of these precautions at our institution.   interpretation sars can easily be spread by direct personal contact in the hospital setting. we found that the implementation of aggressive infection control measures is effective in preventing further transmission of this disease.
cadmium induces nuclear translocation of β-catenin and increases expression of c-myc and abcb1a in kidney proximal tubule cells cadherins and other cell–substrate and cell–cell adhesion molecules play an essential role during development. through their cytoplasmic interaction with the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion molecules physically link cells with the extracellular matrix and/or with each other. these interactions create architectural and structural entities that enable the tissues in the embryo to restrain the physical forces encountered during development. regulated cell adhesion is also often the driving force of morphogenetic movements. this review goes beyond the adhesive aspect of cadherins, focusing on their roles as signaling molecules in development. we discuss how cadherins, through their effects on cell proliferation, cell death, cell polarization, and differentiation, play a role in the formation of tissues and organs in the developing embryo. bioessays 21:211–220, 1999. © 1999 john wiley & sons, inc.
urinary diversion in children and adolescents with neurogenic bladder: the mainz experience a study of the long-term results of ileal conduit urinary diversion for non-malignant disease in 90 children has shown that there were 75 survivors after 10 to 16 years. stomal stenosis and ureteroileal or other intrinsic obstructions requiring ileal loop revisions occurred frequently and as late as 13 years postoperatively. of 144 renal units 76 per cent improved or remained stable and 69.3 per cent of normal kidneys remained normal after more than a decade of urinary diversion. in order to obtain these results close lifetime followup and aggressive loop revisions have been required. urine cultures were consistently negative in 70.5 per cent of all patients. good results were obtained in terms of preservation of renal function in all categories. creatinine clearance remained in the normal range after 10 years if the excretory urogram remained normal. ileal conduit urinary diversion remains a major surgical undertaking but it also remains the standard of urinary diversion against which all other methods must be judged. the results in terms of renal preservation are impressive but so too are the significant number of long-term complications. any other method of diversion (such as the sigmoid conduit) that can improve upon these results will be welcomed. all children with ileal conduit urinary diversion for reasons other than a neurogenic bladder must be considered candidates for urinary reconstruction.
cytotoxic germacranolide sesquiterpenes from the bark of magnolia kobus ten compounds were isolated from the etoac soluble part of the meoh extract of saussureae radix, with their effects on melanin production also evaluated in b-16 mouse melanoma cell lines stimulated with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (ibmx), an elevator of cellular camp. the compounds were identified as aplotaxene (1), 1β-hydroxy arbusculin a (2), costunolide (3), dehydrocostuslactone (4), 11β,13-dihydrocostunolide (5), reynosin (6), heptadec-(9z)-enoic acid (7), β-sitosterol (8), linoleic acid methyl ester (9) and betulinic acid methyl ester (10). compounds 2, 9 and 10 were identified from saussureae radix for the first time. furthermore, compounds 2, 3 and 6 showed potent inhibitory effects on the ibmx-induced melanogenesis, in dose-dependent manners, with ic50 values of 11, 3 and 2.5 μg/ml, respectively. as a positive control, arbutin exhibited an ic50 value of 29 μg/ml.
a rare case of systemic lupus erythematosus with chylous ascites and chylothorax we describe a patient with a history of discoid lupus erythematosus who presented with chylous ascites and chylothorax. analysis of peritoneal and pleural fluid showed a high level of triglycerides and the presence of antinuclear antibody and anti-dsdna antibody. further study revealed other diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus and serologic markers of disease activity. the patient was successfully treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy and high doses of prednisone, followed by immunosuppressants.
long-term effects of a personality-targeted intervention to reduce alcohol use in adolescents. context selective interventions targeting personality risk are showing promise in the prevention of problematic drinking behavior, but their effect on illicit drug use has yet to be evaluated.   objective to investigate the efficacy of targeted coping skills interventions on illicit drug use in adolescents with personality risk factors for substance misuse.   design randomized controlled trial.   setting secondary schools in london, united kingdom.   participants a total of 5302 students were screened to identify 2028 students aged 13 to 16 years with elevated scores on self-report measures of hopelessness, anxiety sensitivity, impulsivity, and sensation seeking. seven hundred thirty-two students provided parental consent to participate in this trial.   intervention participants were randomly assigned to a control no-intervention condition or a 2-session group coping skills intervention targeting 1 of 4 personality profiles.   main outcome measures the trial was designed and powered to primarily evaluate the effect of the intervention on the onset, prevalence, and frequency of illicit drug use over a 2-year period.   results intent-to-treat repeated-measures analyses on continuous measures of drug use revealed time x intervention effects on the number of drugs used (p < .01) and drug use frequency (p < .05), whereby the control group showed significant growth in the number of drugs used as well as more frequent drug use over the 2-year period relative to the intervention group. survival analysis using logistic regression revealed that the intervention was associated with reduced odds of taking up the use of marijuana (beta = -0.3; robust se = 0.2; p = .09; odds ratio = 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.0), cocaine (beta = -1.4; robust se = 0.4; p < .001; odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.5), and other drugs (beta = -0.7; robust se = 0.3; p = .03; odds ratio = 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.9) over the 24-month period.   conclusion this study extends the evidence that brief, personality-targeted interventions can prevent the onset and escalation of substance misuse in high-risk adolescents.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct00344474.
role of nitric oxide mechanisms in control of pyloric motility and transpyloric flow of liquids in conscious dogs antropyloroduodenal motility was recorded in seven anesthetized dogs to assess the role of nitric oxide and l-arginine metabolites in nonadrenergic noncholinergic (nanc) mediation of pyloric relaxation. pyloric activity induced by duodenal field stimulation was inhibited by antral field stimulation and electrical vagal stimulation. intra-arterial ng-l-arginine-methyl-ester (l-name) reduced the inhibition from antral or vagal stimulation (p less than 0.05). intravenous infusion of l-name also blocked the inhibitory effect of vagal and antral stimulation but left the tetrodotoxin-insensitive action of intra-arterial vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip) and sodium nitroprusside unchanged. l-arginine reversed the effect of l-name whereas d-arginine did not. l-name enhanced pyloric contractions to intra-arterial acetylcholine. the nanc inhibition of the substance p-stimulated pyloric response in vitro was blocked by l-name and reversed by addition of l-arginine. sodium nitroprusside was effective as a relaxant in vitro but vip was not. these data suggest that metabolites of l-arginine mediate neural inhibition of canine pyloric motor activity.
progress in cryptology – indocrypt 2013 scan chains are exploited to develop attacks on cryptographic hardware and steal intellectual properties from the chip. this paper proposes a secured strategy to test designs by inserting a certain number of inverters between randomly selected scan cells. the security of the scheme has been analyzed. two detailed case studies of rc4 stream cipher and aes block cipher have been presented to show that the proposed strategy prevents existing scan-based attacks in the literature. the elegance of the scheme lies in its less hardware overhead.
endothelin uncouples gap junctions in sustentacular cells and olfactory ensheathing cells of the olfactory mucosa although gap junctions regulate essential processes during development and differentiation, the role of gap junctions in cell death is poorly understood. we demonstrate here that the forced expression of connexin 43 (cx43), the main constituent of astrocytic gap junctions, protected against cell injury with a potency that was comparable with that from the expression of the proto-oncogenebcl2. the expression of two other members of the cx family, cx32 and cx40, also increased the resistance to injury from exposures to calcium overload, oxidative stress, metabolic inhibition, tamoxifen, and uv irradiation, but not against staurosporine- and dexamethasone-mediated death. surprisingly, the anti-death activity of connexin proteins was independent of gap junction channel function, because physical isolation or the pharmacological inhibition of coupling did not significantly increase cell death. moreover, cells expressing nonfunctional mutant connexins also acquired a high resistance to injury. these observations identify cx proteins as active players in cell survival.
proteome-wide identification of lysine propionylation in thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria: geobacillus kaustophilus, thermus thermophilus, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, and rhodothermus marinus recent studies of protein post-translational modifications revealed that various types of lysine acylation occur in eukaryotic and bacterial proteins. lysine propionylation, a newly discovered type of acylation, occurs in several proteins, including some histones. in this study, we identified 361 propionylation sites in 183 mid-exponential phase and late stationary phase proteins from thermus thermophilus hb8, an extremely thermophilic eubacterium. functional classification of the propionylproteins revealed that the number of propionylation sites in metabolic enzymes increased in late stationary phase, irrespective of protein abundance. the propionylation sites on proteins expressed in mid-exponential and late stationary phases partially overlapped. furthermore, amino acid frequencies in the vicinity of propionylation sites differed, not only between the two growth phases but also relative to acetylation sites. in addition, 33.8% of mid-exponential phase–specific and 80.0% of late stationary phase–specific propionylations (n ≥ 2) implied that specific mechanisms regulate propionylation in the cell. moreover, the limited degree of overlap between lysine propionylation (36.8%) and acetylation (49.2%) sites in 67 proteins that were both acetylated and propionylated strongly suggested that the two acylation reactions are regulated separately by specific enzymes and may serve different functions. finally, we also found that eight propionylation sites overlapped with acetylation sites critical for protein functions such as schiff-base formation and ligand binding.
the sugarless mutation affects the expression of the white eye color gene in drosophila melanogaster in vitro experiments suggest that glycosaminoglycans (gags) and the proteins to which they are attached (proteoglycans) are important for modulating growth factor signaling. however, in vivo evidence to support this view has been lacking, in part because mutations that disrupt the production of gag polymers and the core proteins have not been available. here we describe the identification and characterization of drosophila mutants in the suppenkasper (ska) gene. the ska gene encodes udp-glucose dehydrogenase which produces glucuronic acid, an essential component for the synthesis of heparan and chondroitin sulfate. ska mutants fail to put heparan side chains on proteoglycans such as syndecan. surprisingly, mutant embryos produced by germ-line clones of this general metabolic gene exhibit embryonic cuticle phenotypes strikingly similar to those that result from loss-of-function mutations in genes of the wingless (wg) signaling pathway. zygotic loss of ska leads to reduced growth of imaginal discs and pattern defects similar to wg mutants. in addition, genetic interactions of ska with wg and dishevelled mutants are observed. these data demonstrate the importance of proteoglycans and gags in wg signaling in vivo and suggest that wnt-like growth factors may be particularly sensitive to perturbations of gag biosynthesis.
activation of risk and safe pathways is not involved in the effects of cx43 deficiency on tolerance to ischemia–reperfusion injury and preconditioning protection activation of several protein kinases occurs during myocardial ischaemia and during subsequent reperfusion. in contrast to the intensive investigation into the significance of kinase activation in cardioprotection, relatively little is known about the role of the phosphatases in this regard. the aim of this study was to re-evaluate the putative roles of pp1 and pp2a in ischaemia/reperfusion and in triggering ischaemic preconditioning. isolated perfused working rat hearts were subjected to sustained global (15 or 20 min) or regional ischaemia (35 min), followed by reperfusion. hearts were preconditioned using global ischaemia (1 × 5 or 3 × 5 min, alternated with 5 min reperfusion). to inhibit both pp1 and pp2a cantharidin (5 μm) was used. to inhibit pp2a only, okadaic acid (7.5 nm) was used. the drugs were administered during the preconditioning protocol, before onset of sustained ischaemia (pretreatment) or during reperfusion. endpoints were mechanical recovery during reperfusion, infarct size and activation of pkb/akt, p38 mapk and erk p42/p44, as determined by western blot. pretreatment of hearts with okadaic acid or cantharidin caused a significant reduction in mechanical recovery after 15 or 20 min global ischaemia. administration of the drugs during an ischaemic preconditioning protocol abolished functional recovery during reperfusion and significantly increased infarct size. administration of the drugs during reperfusion had no deleterious effects and increased functional recovery in 3 × pc hearts. to find an explanation for the differential effects of the inhibitors depending on the time of administration, hearts were freeze-clamped at different time points during the perfusion protocol. administration of cantharidin before 5 min ischaemia activated all kinases. subsequent reperfusion for 5 min without the drug maintained activation of the kinases until the onset of sustained ischaemia. cantharidin given during preconditioning was associated with activation of p38mapk and pkb/akt during reperfusion after sustained ischaemia. however, administration of the drug during reperfusion only after sustained ischaemia caused activation of both pkb/akt and erk p42/p44. phosphatase inhibition immediately prior to the onset of sustained ischaemia or during preconditioning abolishes protection during reperfusion, while inhibition of these enzymes during reperfusion either had no effect or enhanced the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. it is proposed that inhibition of phosphatases during reperfusion may prolong the period of risk activation and hence protect the heart.
effect of culturing conditions on the expression of key enzymes in the proteolytic system of lactobacillus bulgaricus abstract lactobacillus helveticus strains possess an efficient proteolytic system that releases peptides which are essential for lactobacillus growth in various fermented dairy products and also affect textural properties or biological activities. cell envelope proteinases (ceps) are bacterial enzymes that hydrolyze milk proteins. in the case of l. helveticus, two ceps with low percentages of amino acid identity have been described, i.e., prth and prth2. however, the distribution of the genes that encode ceps still remains unclear, rendering it difficult to further control the formation of particular peptides. this study evaluated the diversity of genes that encode ceps in a collection of strains of l. helveticus isolated from various biotopes, both in terms of the presence or absence of these genes and in terms of nucleotide sequence, and studied their transcription in dairy matrices. after defining three sets of primers for both the prth and prth2 genes, we studied the distribution of the genes by using pcr and southern blotting experiments. the prth2 gene was ubiquitous in the 29 strains of l. helveticus studied, whereas only 18 of them also exhibited the prth gene. sequencing of a 350-bp internal fragment of these genes revealed the existence of intraspecific diversity. finally, expression of these two cep-encoding genes was followed during the growth in dairy matrices of two strains, itg lh77 and cnrz32, which possess one and two cep-encoding genes, respectively. both genes were shown to be expressed by l. helveticus at each stage of growth in milk and at different stages of mini-swiss-type cheese making and ripening.
laser-assisted three-dimensional surface modifications of titanium implants: preliminary data purpose titanium endosseous implants are becoming increasingly important in dentistry because of their excellent long-term results. however, it has been reported that these implants may lead to higher concentrations of titanium, especially in the lungs and kidneys. the purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine whether co2 laser-assisted decontamination of exposed implant surfaces is associated with an increase in titanium release.   materials and methods in 6 beagle dogs, a total of 60 implants were placed. after osseointegration and second-stage surgery, peri-implantitis was induced by cotton floss ligatures for 12 weeks. surgical treatment consisted of granulation tissue removal, including decontamination of the implant surface with 3 different methods. twenty implants were decontaminated conventionally by an air-powder abrasive for 60 seconds. another 20 implants were decontaminated by laser treatment alone. the last 20 implants were treated conventionally by air-powder abrasive and then lased. four months later, fresh tissue samples of various tissues were evaluated by histologic and chemical analysis.   results quantitative analysis indicated that titanium accumulation could be detected, especially in the spleen, liver, oral mucosa, regional lymph nodes, lung, and kidney in the beagle dog model.   discussion the concentrations found did not exceed those previously reported in the literature.   conclusion these results support the hypothesis that co2 laser-assisted therapy of ailing implants will not result in excessive titanium concentrations in tissues. accordingly, co2 lasers appear suitable and safe for peri-implant gingival surgery.
a qualitative study of health fairs to increase cancer screening in the u.s. from key informant interviews introduction increasing public awareness and knowledge about the need for colorectal cancer (crc) screening among american indians is key to reducing health disparities. the objective of this study was to assess navajo adults' knowledge of crc risk factors and prevention, crc screening, and self-reported experience with crc screening. methods we collected data generated by a self-administered survey given to navajo adults, most of whom lived on the reservation. data were collected at 2 annual tribal fairs in 2006. fair attendees who visited an exhibit booth completed a crc knowledge survey. the study design was nonrandomized. results of the 285 navajo adults who participated, most were bilingual (74%) and female (80%). of the respondents aged 50 years or older, 77% had heard of crc screening and 28% reported being screened for colon or colorectal cancer. knowledge was high (mean, 5.78 [standard deviation (sd), 1.28]) (8.0 was the highest possible knowledge score). respondents with little or no formal schooling had lower scores (mean, 5.4), indicating less knowledge of crc and associated screening tests than did those with more education (mean, 6.0). conclusion among a sample of navajo adults aged 50 years or older, participants with more education were more likely to be knowledgeable about crc and to have received screening. this survey, led by a navajo investigator with navajo surveyors, revealed a high awareness of crc and screening, but overall crc screening was low. crc education for navajo adults who have little or no formal schooling should be improved.
genetic variability of respiratory syncytial virus a in hospitalized children in the last five consecutive winter seasons in central spain human respiratory syncytial virus (hrsv) is the main cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children under 2 years of age and causes repeated infections throughout life. we investigated the genetic variability of rsv-a circulating in ontario during 2010–2011 winter season by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the g glycoprotein gene. among the 201 consecutive rsv isolates studied, rsv-a (55.7%) was more commonly observed than rsv-b (42.3%). 59.8% and 90.1% of rsv-a infections were among children ≤12 months and ≤5 years old, respectively. on phylogenetic analysis of the second hypervariable region of the 112 rsv-a strains, 110 (98.2%) clustered within or adjacent to the na1 genotype; two isolates were ga5 genotype. eleven (10%) na1-related isolates clustered together phylogenetically as a novel rsv-a genotype, named on1, containing a 72 nucleotide duplication in the c-terminal region of the attachment (g) glycoprotein. the predicted polypeptide is lengthened by 24 amino acids and includes a23 amino acid duplication. using rna secondary structural software, a possible mechanism of duplication occurrence was derived. the 23 amino acid on1 g gene duplication results in a repeat of 7 potential o-glycosylation sites including three o-linked sugar acceptors at residues 270, 275, and 283. using phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood analysis, a total of 19 positively selected sites were observed among ontario na1 isolates; six were found to be codons which reverted to the previous state observed in the prototype rsv-a2 strain. the tendency of codon regression in the g-ectodomain may infer a decreased avidity of antibody to the current circulating strains. further work is needed to document and further understand the emergence, virulence, pathogenicity and transmissibility of this novel rsv-a genotype with a72 nucleotide g gene duplication.
molecular regulation of alternative polyadenylation (apa) within the drosophila nervous system cleavage factor i(m) (cfi(m)) is a highly conserved component of the eukaryotic mrna 3' processing machinery that functions in sequence-specific poly(a) site recognition through the collaboration of a 25 kda subunit containing a nudix domain and a larger subunit of 59, 68, or 72 kda containing an rna recognition motif (rrm). our previous work demonstrated that cfi(m)25 is both necessary and sufficient for sequence-specific binding of the poly(a) site upstream element ugua. here, we report the crystal structure of cfi(m)25 complexed with the rrm domain of cfi(m)68 and rna. the cfi(m)25 dimer is clasped on opposite sides by two cfi(m)68 rrm domains. each cfi(m)25 subunit binds one ugua element specifically. biochemical analysis indicates that the cfi(m)68 rrms serve to enhance rna binding and facilitate rna looping. the intrinsic ability of cfi(m) to direct rna looping may provide a mechanism for its function in the regulation of alternative poly(a) site selection.
electrostatic mechanisms underlie neomycin block of the cardiac ryanodine receptor channel (ryr2). charybdotoxin (ctx), a small, basic protein from scorpion venom, strongly inhibits the conduction of k ions through high-conductance, ca2+-activated k+ channels. the interaction of ctx with ca2+-activated k+ channels from rat skeletal muscle plasma membranes was studied by inserting single channels into uncharged planar phospholipid bilayers. ctx blocks k+ conduction by binding to the external side of the channel, with an apparent dissociation constant of approximately 10 nm at physiological ionic strength. the dwell-time distributions of both blocked and unblocked states are single-exponential. the toxin association rate varies linearly with the ctx concentration, and the dissociation rate is independent of it. ctx is competent to block both open and closed channels; the association rate is sevenfold faster for the open channel, while the dissociation rate is the same for both channel conformations. membrane depolarization enhances the ctx dissociation rate e-fold/28 mv; if the channel's open probability is maintained constant as voltage varies, then the toxin association rate is voltage independent. increasing the external solution ionic strength from 20 to 300 mm (with k+, na+, or arginine+) reduces the association rate by two orders of magnitude, with little effect on the dissociation rate. we conclude that ctx binding to the ca2+-activated k+ channel is a bimolecular process, and that the ctx interaction senses both voltage and the channel's conformational state. we further propose that a region of fixed negative charge exists near the channel's ctx-binding site.
development of bovine embryos reconstructed by nuclear transfer of transfected and non-transfected adult fibroblast cells. the objective of this study was to determine if the transfection of human prourokinase (prou) gene and passage number of transfected ear fibroblasts affected in vitro development of bovine transgenic nuclear transfer (nt) embryos. an expression plasmid for human prou was constructed by inserting a bovine beta-casein promoter, a green fluorescent protein (gfp) marker and human prou gene into a pcdna3 plasmid and transfected into bovine ear fibroblasts using a lipid mediated method. abattoir derived oocytes were enucleated at 18-20 hr post maturation and a single donor cell was transferred into the perivitelline space of a recipient oocyte. after fusion and activation, the couplets were cultured in modified synthetic oviductal fluid (msof) medium for 168 hr. in experiment 1, significantly lower rate in blastocysts formation (10.3%) was observed in transfected donor cells at early passage than that in nontransfected counterparts (22.1%, p<0.05). in experiment 2, development to blastocysts and gfp expression in blastocysts were not significantly different between early (3-7) and late (8-12) passage donor cells (10.3 vs. 11.3% and 54.5 vs. 41.7%, respectively). this study indicates that in vitro development of bovine transgenic nt embryos is negatively influenced by transfection of human prou gene into donor fibroblasts. however, passage number of transfected ear fibroblasts does not affect in vitro development of bovine transgenic nt embryos.
preventive effect of aminoguanidine compared to vitamin e and c on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. the effect of aminoguanidine (ag) on nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin (cddp) was investigated. a single dose of cddp (7.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced nephrotoxicity, manifested biochemically by a significant elevation in serum urea, creatinine and a severe decrease in serum albumin. moreover, marked increases in kidney weight, urine volume and urinary excretion of albumin were observed. nephrotoxicity was further confirmed by a significant decrease in glutathione-s-transferase (gst, e.c. 2.5.1.18), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px, e.c. 1.11.1.9) and catalase (e.c. 1.11.1.6) and a significant increase in lipid peroxides measured as malondialdhyde (mda) in kidney homogenates. administration of ag (100 mg/kg per day p.o.) in drinking water 5 days before and 5 days after cddp injection produced a significant protection against nephrotoxicity induced by cddp. the amelioration of nephrotoxicity was evidenced by significant reductions in serum urea and creatinine concentrations. in addition, ag tended to normalize decreased levels of serum albumin. urine volume, urinary excretions of albumin and gst and kidney weight were significantly decreased. moreover, ag prevented the rise of mda and the reduction of gst and gsh-px activities in the kidney. these results suggest that ag has a protective effect on nephrotoxicity induced by cddp and it may therefore improve the therapeutic index of cddp.
mating type influences chromosome loss and replicative senescence in telomerase‐deficient budding yeast by dnl4‐dependent telomere fusion using a model system, we have shown that replicative senescence is accompanied by a 16-fold increase in base substitution and frameshift mutations near a chromosome end. the increase was dependent on error-prone polymerases required for the mutagenic response to dna lesions that block the replication fork.
cadmium induces nuclear translocation of β-catenin and increases expression of c-myc and abcb1a in kidney proximal tubule cells cadherins and other cell–substrate and cell–cell adhesion molecules play an essential role during development. through their cytoplasmic interaction with the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion molecules physically link cells with the extracellular matrix and/or with each other. these interactions create architectural and structural entities that enable the tissues in the embryo to restrain the physical forces encountered during development. regulated cell adhesion is also often the driving force of morphogenetic movements. this review goes beyond the adhesive aspect of cadherins, focusing on their roles as signaling molecules in development. we discuss how cadherins, through their effects on cell proliferation, cell death, cell polarization, and differentiation, play a role in the formation of tissues and organs in the developing embryo. bioessays 21:211–220, 1999. © 1999 john wiley & sons, inc.
incidence of cronobacter sakazakii in powdered infant formula milk available in malaysia enterobacter sakazakii is an emerging pathogen associated with life-threatening neonatal infections resulting from the consumption of contaminated powdered infant formula milk (ifm). recent taxonomic analyses have determined that e. sakazakii comprises a number of genomospecies, and it has been proposed that e. sakazakii be reclassified as a novel genus, "cronobacter". accurate methods are required for the rapid detection and identification of this group of micro-organisms, since even low cell numbers have been reported to cause disease. the aim of this study was to evaluate various e. sakazakii detection methods in order to ascertain the most suitable method for detection and identification of these pathogenic agents. samples from ifm and the environment were evaluated for the presence of e. sakazakii using the isolation steps (pre-enrichment, enrichment and selection) described in the food and drug administration (fda) method for e. sakazakii detection. sixty-four isolates (50 from ifm and 14 from the environment) were selected from tryptone soy agar (tsa), regardless of colony appearance, and these isolates were identified by 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequencing. thereafter, different culture-dependent and culture-independent methods were evaluated to accurately detect and identify the e. sakazakii isolates. these methods included the assessment of yellow pigment production on tsa, typical colonies on chromogenic druggan-forsythe-iversen (dfi) and chromocult enterobacter sakazakii (ces) media and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using six different species-specific primer pairs described in the literature. identification of e. sakazakii using yellow pigment production was demonstrated to have a low sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (87%, 71% and 74%, respectively), which lowers the suitability of the fda method. chromogenic dfi and ces media were sensitive, specific and accurate (100%, 98% and 98%, respectively) for the detection of e. sakazakii. the specificity of the pcr amplifications ranged from 8% to 92%, emphasising the need for rigorous primer testing against closely related species. of the primer pairs evaluated, esakf/esakr were the most suitable for e. sakazakii detection and identification. the detection limit of esakf/esakr was found to be 10(4) cfu/ml. this study demonstrated that no single method was capable of unambiguously confirming the presence and identity of e. sakazakii isolates, that each method had inherent advantages and disadvantages, and that in most cases several methods were required for accurate detection and identification. further, it was demonstrated that the current fda method for e. sakazakii detection should be revised in the light of the availability of more sensitive, specific and accurate detection methods.
effect of selenium supplementation on blood status and milk, urine, and fecal excretion in pregnant and lactating camel selenium (se) is an essential micronutrient for the prevention of a number of deficiency syndromes in a variety of species (underwood, 1981). the occurrence of se deficiency in the dromedary camel was reported by zhang et al. (1986). in morocco, se deficiency is a widespread problem in the major grazing areas (hamliri, 1989) and one of the authors (a.h.) has diagnosed cases of se deficiency in a group of young dromedary camels consuming a diet containing 0.02 p.p.m. se on a dry matter basis. the seleno-enzyme glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px) is widely used as an indicator of se status because it is regularly correlated with blood se concentration (ganther et az., 1976). however, to the authors’ knowledge this correlation has not been previously studied in the dromedary camel.
extending the supply chain visibility boundary: utilizing stakeholders for identifying supply chain sustainability risks despite ambitious efforts in various fields of research over multiple decades, the goal of making academic research relevant to the practitioner remains elusive: theoretical and academic research interests do not seem to coincide with the interests of managerial practice. this challenge is more fundamental than knowledge transfer, it is one of diverging knowledge interests and means of knowledge production. in this paper, we look at this fundamental challenge through the lens of design science, which is an approach aimed primarily at discovery and problem-solving as opposed to accumulation of theoretical knowledge. we explore in particular the ways in which problem-solving research and theory-oriented academic research can complement one another. in operations management (om) research, recognizing and building on this complementarity is especially crucial, because problem-solving-oriented research produces the very artifacts (e.g., technologies) that empirical om research subsequently evaluates in an attempt to build explanatory theory. it is indeed the practitioner - not the academic scientist - who engages in basic research in om. this idiosyncrasy prompts the question: how can we enhance the cross-fertilization between academic research and research practice to make novel theoretical insights and practical relevance complementary? this article proposes a design science approach to bridge practice to theory, not vice versa, theory to practice.
liquid- and gas-phase diffusion of ferrocene in thin films of metal-organic frameworks metal-organic frameworks (mofs) are highly porous materials generally consisting of two building elements: inorganic coupling units and organic linkers. these frameworks offer an enormous porosity, which can be used to store large amounts of gases and, as demonstrated in more recent applications, makes these compounds suitable for drug release. the huge sizes of the pores inside mofs, however, also give rise to a fundamental complication, namely the formation of sublattices occupying the same space. this interpenetration greatly reduces the pore size and thus the available space within the mof structure. we demonstrate here that the formation of the second, interpenetrated framework can be suppressed by using liquid-phase epitaxy on an organic template. this success demonstrates the potential of the step-by-step method to synthesize new classes of mofs not accessible by conventional solvothermal methods.
ultrahigh-pressure acoustic wave velocities of sio2-al2o3 glasses up to 200 gpa acoustic wave velocities of sio2 glass were measured up to pressures of 207 gpa using newly developed brillouin scattering spectroscopic techniques to address the nature of pressure-induced structural changes. the acoustic wave velocity data suggests three distinct pressure regimes, two of which correspond to changes in the si-o coordination number with pressure, and one of which indicates the stability of sixfold-coordinated si over a broad pressure interval from approximately 40-140 gpa. an anomalous increase in the effect of pressure on velocity at 140 gpa most likely corresponds to the onset of structural densification associated with an increase in coordination number from sixfold to a higher coordination state.
do we follow evidence-based medicine recommendations during inguinal hernia surgery? results of a survey covering 2441 hernia repairs in 2007 introductionchronic pain after hernia repair is common, and it is unclear to what extent the different operation techniques influence its incidence. the aim of the present study was to compare the three major standardized techniques of hernia repair with regard to postoperative pain.patients and methodstwo hundred and eighty male patients with primary hernias were prospectively, randomly selected to undergo shouldice, tension-free lichtenstein or laparoscopic transabdominal pre-peritoneal (tapp) hernioplasty repairs. patients were examined after 52 months with emphasis on chronic pain and its limitations to their quality of life.resultschronic pain was present in 36% of patients after shouldice repair, in 31% after lichtenstein repair and in 15% after tapp repair. pain correlated with physical strain in 25% of patients after shouldice, in 20% after lichtenstein and in 11% after tapp repair. limitations to daily life, leisure activities and sports occurred in 14% of patients after shouldice, 13% after lichtenstein and 2.4% after tapp repair.conclusionchronic pain after hernia surgery is significantly more common with the open approach to the groin by shouldice and lichtenstein methods. the presence of the prosthetic mesh was not associated with significant postoperative complaints. the tapp repair represents the most effective approach of the three techniques in the hands of an experienced surgeon.
learning secure programming in open source software communities: a socio-technical view ethnography is a qualitative research method used to study people and cultures. it is largely adopted in disciplines outside software engineering, including different areas of computer science. ethnography can provide an in-depth understanding of the socio-technological realities surrounding everyday software development practice, i.e., it can help to uncover not only what practitioners do, but also why they do it. despite its potential, ethnography has not been widely adopted by empirical software engineering researchers, and receives little attention in the related literature. the main goal of this paper is to explain how empirical software engineering researchers would benefit from adopting ethnography. this is achieved by explicating four roles that ethnography can play in furthering the goals of empirical software engineering: to strengthen investigations into the social and human aspects of software engineering; to inform the design of software engineering tools; to improve method and process development; and to inform research programmes. this article introduces ethnography, explains its origin, context, strengths and weaknesses, and presents a set of dimensions that position ethnography as a useful and usable approach to empirical software engineering research. throughout the paper, relevant examples of ethnographic studies of software practice are used to illustrate the points being made.
physiological and molecular mechanisms of plant salt tolerance transgenic plants overexpressing the vacuolar h+-pyrophosphatase are much more resistant to high concentrations of nacl and to water deprivation than the isogenic wild-type strains. these transgenic plants accumulate more na+ and k+ in their leaf tissue than the wild type. moreover, direct measurements on isolated vacuolar membrane vesicles derived from the avp1 transgenic plants and from wild type demonstrate that the vesicles from the transgenic plants have enhanced cation uptake. the phenotypes of the avp1 transgenic plants suggest that increasing the vacuolar proton gradient results in increased solute accumulation and water retention. presumably, sequestration of cations in the vacuole reduces their toxic effects. genetically engineered drought- and salt-tolerant plants could provide an avenue to the reclamation of farmlands lost to agriculture because of salinity and a lack of rainfall.
standardisation advancements in the area of routing for mobile ad-hoc networks this memo first describes the characteristics of mobile ad hoc networks (manets), and their idiosyncrasies with respect to traditional, hardwired packet networks. it then discusses the effect these differences have on the design and evaluation of network control protocols with an emphasis on routing performance evaluation considerations.
maternal separation and handling affects cocaine self-administration in both the treated pups as adults and the dams the effect of corticosterone on the acquisition of cocaine-seeking behavior was investigated in rats using ascending dose-response curves for intravenous cocaine self-administration. rats pretreated daily with corticosterone (2.0 mg/kg i.p.) acquired cocaine self-administration at a lower dose compared with vehicle-treated controls. in contrast, daily corticosterone pretreatment did not alter food-maintained responding. cocaine self-administration was not affected by the type i (mineralocorticoid) receptor agonist, aldosterone (100 microgram/kg). however, rats treated with the type ii (glucocorticoid) receptor agonist, dexamethasone (10 or 100 microgram/kg) did not acquire self-administration at any dose tested. the 100 microgram/kg dose of dexamethasone attenuated food-reinforced behavior and decreased body weight, but these effects were not observed with the 10 microgram/kg dose. dexamethasone dose-dependently attenuated the plasma corticosterone response to self-administered infusions or intraperitoneal injections of cocaine, indicating that the ability of dexamethasone to block cocaine-induced corticosterone secretion may have contributed to its effects on self-administration. administration of aldosterone (100 microgram/kg) together with 10 microgram/kg dexamethasone restored self-administration to the level of vehicle-treated rats, suggesting that type i receptor occupation by corticosterone may be required for the acquisition of this behavior. these results indicate that stress-induced corticosterone secretion may provide a substrate through which stressors interact with cocaine reinforcement. additionally, the finding that dexamethasone blocks the acquisition of cocaine self-administration may be relevant to the development of novel approaches to the treatment of cocaine addiction.
organic acid profile of isovaleric acidemia: a comprehensive metabolomics approach isovaleric acidemia (iva) is one of the most common organic acidemias found in south africa. since 1983, a significant number of iva cases have been identified in approximately 20,000 caucasian patients screened for metabolic defects. iva is caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of isovaleryl-coa dehydrogenase (ivd) resulting in the accumulation of isovaleryl-coa and its metabolites. in total, 10 iva patients and three carriers were available for phenotypic and genotypic investigation in this study. all patients were found to be homozygous for a single c.367 g > a (p.g123r) mutation. the amino acid substitution of a glycine to arginine resulted in a markedly reduced steady-state level of the ivd protein, which explains the nearly complete lack of ivd enzyme activity as assessed in fibroblast homogenates. despite the genetic homogeneity of this south african iva group, the clinical presentation varied widely, ranging from severe mental handicap and multiple episodes of metabolic derangement to an asymptomatic state. the variation may be due to poor dietary intervention, delayed diagnosis or even epigenetic and polygenetic factors of unknown origin.
partial characterization of venom from the colombian spider phoneutria boliviensis (aranae:ctenidae) several pools of neurotoxic peptides obtained from fractionated phoneutria nigriventer venom induce different toxicological effects. one of them, phtx4, is highly toxic towards insects and displays only a slight toxicity when injected in mice. also, this fraction contains a class of peptides that are able to inhibit glutamate uptake in preparations of mammalian central nervous systems (cns). in this work a new toxin called pntx4-3 was isolated from the phtx4 fraction by reverse phase and anion exchange steps using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). edman sequencing of pntx4-3 revealed that it was a polypeptide of 48 amino acid residues, containing 10 cysteines cross-linked by five disulfide bridges. the molecular mass measured by es-q-tof mass spectrometry was 5199.49+/-0.64 da, which is very close to the calculated mass from amino acid sequence (5199.99 da). this toxin induces immediate excitatory effects when injected intrathoracically in house flies and cockroaches. intracerebroventricular injections of 30 microg of pntx4-3 in mice resulted in no apparent signs of intoxication. in order to make an orthologous comparison, pharmacological characterisation were carried out in rat brain synaptosomes by using [3h]-l-glutamate, showed that the whole phtx4 fraction as well as the pure toxins pntx4-3, tx4(6-1) and tx4(5-5) obtained of this fraction, were able to inhibit the glutamate uptake in the micromolar concentration range. pntx4-3 inhibits the glutamate uptake in a dose dependent manner, with an ic50 of approximately 1 microm. pntx4-3 is highly homologous to the tx4(6-1) and tx4(5-5) toxins previously described from the same fraction.
bleeding patterns with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system when used for heavy menstrual bleeding in women without structural pelvic pathology: a pooled analysis of randomized controlled studies. a 20 micrograms/24 hours levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine contraceptive device (lng-iud) has, in an open randomized multicenter study, been compared to the copper-releasing device nova t during 5 years of use; 1821 women had the lng-iud and 937 women had the nova t inserted. the 5-year cumulative gross pregnancy rate was 5.9% for nova t and 0.5% for the lng-iud. the local effect of levonorgestrel in the uterine cavity causes reduction of menstrual blood loss and development of oligo-amenorrhea, and the termination rates because of heavy and/or prolonged menstrual flow were significantly (p < 0.001) lower among lng-iud users. however, the gross termination rate because of amenorrhea was 6.0 in this group. hb increased during use of the lng-iud and decreased during nova t use, and the difference between the devices was statistically significant. the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) was low in lng-iud users regardless of age, whereas in the nova t group, the pid rate was increased among the youngest women, which makes the difference between the devices significant (p < 0.01). the gross termination rate for reasons considered to be hormonal was 12.1 in the lng-iud group compared to 2.0 in the nova t group (p < 0.001). the lng-iud is a long-acting reversible contraceptive method for 5 years with a pregnancy rate comparable to female sterilization. the incidence of pid is low even in young women. in addition, the positive health effects such as decreased menstrual blood loss and increased blood haemoglobin concentration make the lng-iud a favorable combination of hormonal and intrauterine contraception.
